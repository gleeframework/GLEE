"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice since the product is worth less to her than to you.  You have room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. How about $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You can still try to negotiate a lower price. The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's already come down from $110 to $105. There's still some wiggle room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $105. How about we split the difference at $100? I'm confident we can close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can do $102.50, but I think that's as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, it's probably not worth continuing to negotiate.  You've already gotten the price down to $102.50, which is a good deal for you considering you are willing to pay $120 to John.  There is a small chance you can get it down a little further, but the likelihood of getting a better offer from Alice isn't high enough to justify the potential time and effort to continue negotiating."
