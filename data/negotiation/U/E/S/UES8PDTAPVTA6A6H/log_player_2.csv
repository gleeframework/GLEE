Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give it away. How about $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $102.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed savings rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
