"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $7,000 is a little lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $8,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another offer of $7,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",7500.0,Bob,4,
