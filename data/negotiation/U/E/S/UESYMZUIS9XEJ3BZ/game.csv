"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $10000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can we meet in the middle at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a limited budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your offer. Let's try $11000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better than $11000. How about $9500 is still too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $9800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9800. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my original offer. Let's try $10800. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I think we can do better than $10800. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to offer $10200. Can we agree on that?",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10200. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my original offer. Let's try $11500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment.",11500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good return on your investment, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make a final offer. I'm willing to go up to $9900, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we agree on that?",9900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9900. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to get closer to my original offer. Let's try $12000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment.",12000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've made a lot of concessions and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm making a final offer of $9500. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $10000. I'm willing to give you one last chance to make a deal.",9500.0,Bob,10,
