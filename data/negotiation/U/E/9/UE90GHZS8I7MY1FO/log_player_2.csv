"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $10,000 for the product. This offer takes into account both the worth of the product and your perceived value for it. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's less than your maximum, you can likely get a better price.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice values the product at $8,000. There's room for a deal that benefits both parties."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, I'm looking to spend closer to $9,000. I think this price is fair considering the value to me and your desired selling price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I am willing to consider your offer of $9,000. However, I need to ensure that I receive a fair return for my efforts and resources invested in the product. Therefore, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with our respective positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is close to my desired price.**  $9,500 is only $500 more than my initial counteroffer of $9,000.
* **It's still a good deal.**  I'm saving $2,500 compared to buying from John.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth the time.**  While I could try to get a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away and I'll have to buy from John at a higher price."
