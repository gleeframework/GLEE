"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a little bit above what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build a positive rapport with Bob by highlighting the value of the product.  I want to see if he'll bite at this price or if he'll counter offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price.  I'll counter offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $60 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 
I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that's closer to what he's willing to pay but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will make him feel like we're making progress and will encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer of $75. It's a bit less than what I'd hoped for, but it's better than selling to John for $120.  It's also getting late in the negotiation, and there's a risk that Bob will walk away if I keep rejecting his offers."
