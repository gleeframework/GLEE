Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you, and it's still a good price for me.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm highlighting that this is a good deal for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of getting a good bargain.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm being open to negotiation by encouraging Bob to respond.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a backup buyer in John, giving me leverage if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even lower than my initial offer.
* **Leverage:** I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum price. 
* **Potential for higher price:**  I can potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects the value we both see in the product, and it's a fair price considering the quality and potential benefits.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $10,500 is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. 
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Emphasize Value:** I remind Bob of the value of the product to maintain his interest.
* **Closing the Deal:** I use a phrase like ""Let's make this happen!"" to create urgency and encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think we can meet in the middle and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still a significant difference.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially losing the opportunity to sell to John, who is guaranteed to pay my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John ensures a profit of $15,000, which is a much better outcome than potentially settling for a lower price with Bob."
