"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price to encourage Bob to negotiate. I'm aiming to see if I can secure a deal close to my minimum acceptable price in the first round.  If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round.  I can still potentially get a better price from Bob, or I can choose to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer but $60 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 
I'm lowering my price slightly, but still significantly above Bob's offer.  I want to see if I can find a middle ground with Bob, but I'm also leaving room to negotiate further in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can squeeze a little more out of him.  There are still rounds to go and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is just too low. I'm willing to go down to $90.  I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price, but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. I'm trying to meet Bob halfway while still getting closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping this offer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating in the next rounds if necessary."
