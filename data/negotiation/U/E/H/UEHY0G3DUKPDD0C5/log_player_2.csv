"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $16,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll value it highly. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000. You can get the product for $15,000 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and go with John."
