"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to secure a good deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The $1,750,000 offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, allowing room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and expresses confidence in the value proposition, encouraging Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** $1,400,000 is lower than my $1,500,000 minimum, so I cannot accept it.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I have 9 rounds left, and I can potentially negotiate a higher price.
* **Exploring other options:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting,  I believe there's a chance to get closer to my desired price range with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately it's still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the potential for a long-term partnership, I'd be willing to accept $1,600,000. This would allow both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards my minimum:** This offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Highlighting potential benefits:** I'm emphasizing the value and potential benefits of the product to encourage Bob to accept a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message expresses a willingness to negotiate, suggesting flexibility within the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
