Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. Aiming for $1,200,000 allows room for negotiation while still potentially securing a significant profit.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Framing the price in terms of ""value"" and ""worth"" can make it feel more justified to Bob, even if it's above his initial perceived value.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to gauge his interest and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 

By starting high and being willing to negotiate, you maximize your chances of getting the best possible price from Bob while still having John as a safety net."
