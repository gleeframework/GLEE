"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the $950,000 offer is still too low for me to accept.  To move things along, I'm willing to accept $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but no higher. I believe this is the maximum I can afford and still make a profit.",975000.0,Bob,6,
