Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,050,000 is still out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal here.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's finalize this agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While ideally, I'd like to get closer to $1,000,000, Bob's offer of $950,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's a significant profit above his initial offers, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether."
