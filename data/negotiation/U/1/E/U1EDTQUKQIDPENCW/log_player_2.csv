"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair deal considering the significant return you stand to make. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is below your maximum price, you can get a better deal by rejecting it. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or create a sense of urgency, pushing her closer to your desired price range."
