Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair deal considering the significant return you stand to make."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Surplus:** There's a potential surplus of $200,000 ($1,000,000 - $800,000) to be split.

**Strategy:**

The offer aims to capture a significant portion of the surplus value while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept. Here's why:

* **High but Acceptable:**  $925,000 is a high price, but Bob still gains $75,000 in value ($1,000,000 - $925,000).
* **Justification:** The message highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return"" to justify the high price.

**Outcome:**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, you secure a sale significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Rejection:** If Bob rejects, you still have the safety net of John's offer, ensuring you don't lose out.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the best possible outcome while having a safety net in place."
