"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth significantly more to both of us than my minimum price.  I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair deal considering its true value.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer of $1,350,000 is more than Alice's valuation, it's significantly less than your maximum price of $1,500,000 and the alternative offer from John. Accepting this offer saves you $150,000 compared to buying from John."
