Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth significantly more to both of us than my minimum price.  I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair deal considering its true value.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Avoid a Lowball:** Offering a price too close to John's $1,000,000 backup offer leaves potential profit on the table.
* **Confident Language:** The message aims to convey value and subtly create a sense of urgency without pressuring Bob too much."
