Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **""Public Listing"" Tactic:** Mentioning a public listing creates a sense of urgency and potential competition, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept the offer."
