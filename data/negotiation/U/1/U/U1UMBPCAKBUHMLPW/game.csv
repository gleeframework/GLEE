,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm happy to pay $85 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $100. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but it's still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  I think it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a good deal.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to go up to $90, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal!",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not getting the value I'm looking for at $90. I'm willing to meet you at $92.50, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a good deal.",92.5,Alice,7,
