"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $140, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't immediately undercut myself.
* **Friendly approach:**  I'm using a friendly tone and emphasizing the value Bob might find in the product. This helps build rapport and makes the negotiation feel less adversarial.
* **Open-ended question:** By asking ""What do you think?"" I'm inviting Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I believe I can offer you $130 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value of the product:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I don't want to sell it at a loss.
* **Potential for higher price:**  I believe Bob is willing to pay more, given he values the product at $150. By rejecting his offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a better price.
* **Avoiding John:** While John offers $120, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest! While $130 is tempting, I'd need to get at least $135 to make this work for me.  What do you think about that?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $135, which is still lower than my initial offer but higher than his.
* **Reasoning:** I'm giving Bob a reason for my counteroffer, stating it's ""to make this work for me."" This makes it seem less arbitrary and more based on my own needs.
* **Maintaining open negotiation:**  I'm again using an open-ended question (""What do you think?"") to encourage further discussion and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to offer you $132 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $132 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited room for improvement:** While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or I might not get a significantly better offer. 
* **Time constraints:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's becoming more important to secure a deal.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a decent price without risking losing the deal altogether."
