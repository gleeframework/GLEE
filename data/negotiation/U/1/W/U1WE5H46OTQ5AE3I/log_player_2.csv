"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for a little less than I could get from someone else.  How about $130? Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. You can do much better."
