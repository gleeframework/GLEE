"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think that's a fair price for the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
