Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is above my minimum value of $80. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage a positive interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $80. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $100. I'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90.  Would you be interested in that?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $85 isn't my ideal price, it's higher than John's offer and is close enough to my minimum that I'm happy to close the deal."
