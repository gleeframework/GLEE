{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm asking for $110 for it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. By offering a price slightly lower than your minimum, you show flexibility and open the door for a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $100. How about we try $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we go with $98?  It's a fair compromise, and gets us closer to a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 98} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still not comfortable with $98. How about we try $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm starting to get the feeling that Bob is not going to budge much further.  It's not worth potentially going back and forth for a few more dollars.  It's time to move on to John and secure the $120 sale."
