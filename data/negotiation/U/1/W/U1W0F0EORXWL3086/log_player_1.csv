Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Not Too High:**  While aiming high, it's important to keep the offer within a reasonable range. Asking for significantly more than double the product's value to Bob ($15,000) could deter him entirely. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $20,000, there's space for Bob to counter-offer, and we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Confident but Open:** The message aims to be confident about the product's value while remaining open to Bob's perspective and inviting him to discuss the price.

**Important Note:**  There's a balance to strike. If Bob rejects this offer, we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John. However, a successful negotiation with Bob could result in a higher profit."
