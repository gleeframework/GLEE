"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value for us, and I believe it will be equally valuable to you. After careful consideration, I propose to offer this unique item to you at a special price of $900,000. This represents a significant discount compared to its intrinsic value of $1,000,000 to you, which I believe makes it an attractive proposition.

The product offers numerous benefits that align perfectly with your needs and aspirations, and I am confident it will contribute significantly to your endeavors. I understand that making such a decision might not be immediate, so please take your time to evaluate the offer carefully.

Should you choose to proceed, I assure you of a smooth transaction and excellent customer service throughout the process. If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $1,000,000 and lower than the price John is offering. This means you can buy the product and still save $100,000 compared to buying from John."
