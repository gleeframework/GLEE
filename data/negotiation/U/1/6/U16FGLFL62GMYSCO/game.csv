"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, $11,000 is closer but still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $10,000?  That's my best offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your best offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
