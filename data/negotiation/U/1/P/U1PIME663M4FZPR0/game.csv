Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?,18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you highlighting the unique value of the product. However, $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. This reflects the value I see in it and is within my budget. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $14000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit outside my price range. I'm happy to go up to $12000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $12000 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $13500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. While $13500 is closer, it's still a bit higher than my budget. I'm prepared to pay $12500, which is my final offer. If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to explore other options.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $12500 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $13250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to consider other options, including selling the product to John for $15000.",13250.0,Alice,7,
