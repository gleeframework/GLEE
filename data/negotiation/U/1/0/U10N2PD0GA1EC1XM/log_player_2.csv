"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $135 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can get the product for cheaper from John. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $125?  That's still a fair price for you and within my budget."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is still a little too low for me. How about $130?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me keep this valuable product moving. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $130 is still more than what you're willing to pay. Since John is selling the product for $120, it's best to buy it from him to save money."
