"Hello Bob, I'm interested in selling this product to you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. Would you like to buy it from me for $150?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice,  $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I can do $125, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not comfortable with $110. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $115? It's still a good deal for you, and it's a bit more in line with what I need to make on this product.",115.0,Alice,5,
