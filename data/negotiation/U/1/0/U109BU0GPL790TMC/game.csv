"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  Let me know what you think!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. How about $1,100,000? That's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's the best I can offer at this time.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Would you consider $1,025,000? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
