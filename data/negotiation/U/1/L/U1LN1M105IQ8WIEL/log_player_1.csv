Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your flexibility, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives us both room to work with. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's make this deal happen.
