"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your flexibility, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives us both room to work with. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,750. This is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's make this deal happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's worth considering. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
