"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $10,500 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  

Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your flexibility, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives us both room to work with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,750. This is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,750 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob is determined to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible, so he'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's worth considering. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above Bob's budget. While it's closer to Bob's target, he has only 5 rounds left to make a deal.  

Bob is better off buying the product from John for $8,000.  This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation.  There's no guarantee Alice will come down to Bob's price range, and he doesn't want to risk losing out on the deal completely."
