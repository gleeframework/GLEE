Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting low:** Since your maximum budget is $80, offering that amount is your best starting point.  
* **Showing your limit:**  This clearly demonstrates your budget and creates pressure on Alice. 
* **Hope for compromise:**  Alice may be willing to come down, especially considering she values the product at $150.  You can then work towards a mutually agreeable price."
