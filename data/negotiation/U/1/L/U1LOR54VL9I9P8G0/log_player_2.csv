"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to pay no more than $120, and Alice's offer is $100. This is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in the product and would be happy to close a deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 90}
