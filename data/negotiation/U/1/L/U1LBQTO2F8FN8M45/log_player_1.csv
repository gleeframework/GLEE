Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product might be worth more than Bob's estimated value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob to share his thoughts, making it clear Alice is open to discussion. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still being reasonable enough to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
