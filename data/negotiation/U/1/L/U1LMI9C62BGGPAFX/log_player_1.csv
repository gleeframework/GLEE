Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $12,000 is closer to a realistic price point, I can't accept that low of an offer. To be fair, how about we settle at $15,500?"", ""product_price"": 15500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $15,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Bob is not moving substantially towards a price point that is beneficial to me. It's unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable price, so it's time to cut the losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
