"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] at a special price. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth a lot more than what I'm asking. Let's talk - I'm flexible, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $12,000 is less than $15,000.
* **You still save money:** You are willing to pay up to $15,000, so even at $12,000 you're saving money."
