"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $10000 for it, which is a great value considering its quality and potential.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $9250.  This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $8750?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
