"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm open to discussing this further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
