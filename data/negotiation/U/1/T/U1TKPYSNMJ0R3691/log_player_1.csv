Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $90. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer gives me a decent profit of $10, while still being appealing to Bob since it's below his perceived value. It also leaves room for negotiation if needed."
