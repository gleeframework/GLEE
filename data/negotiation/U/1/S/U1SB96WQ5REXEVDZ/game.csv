"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know if this is a price we can work with.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to make a reasonable deal.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $13,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $14,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,500 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  I'm hopeful we can find a way to make this work.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it.",14250.0,Alice,7,
