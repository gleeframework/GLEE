"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. He has room to negotiate and can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know if this is a price we can work with."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than the previous offer, $16,000 is still above his budget. He should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to make a reasonable deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $13,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $14,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While this is a better offer than before, it's still above Bob's budget.  He's close to his limit, but he should try to negotiate further to see if he can get a lower price.  There's still room to make a counteroffer, and he has 5 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,500 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  I'm hopeful we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000. While Alice is getting closer to his budget, $14,250 is still more than he wants to pay.  He only has 3 rounds remaining, and it's unlikely he'll get a better deal from Alice."
