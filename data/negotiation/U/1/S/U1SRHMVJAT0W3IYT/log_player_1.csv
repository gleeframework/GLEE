Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Above Your Minimum:**  Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, you're still likely to get a price higher than the $120 John is offering. 
 
Let's see what Bob says!"
