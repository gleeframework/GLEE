"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset for a significant savings and provides me with a fair price for my product.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I'm happy to negotiate, $650,000 is significantly lower than the value I'm seeking for the product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still allows for a good deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
