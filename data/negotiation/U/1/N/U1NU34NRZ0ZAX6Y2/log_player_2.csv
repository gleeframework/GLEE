# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset for a significant savings and provides me with a fair price for my product.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I'm happy to negotiate, $650,000 is significantly lower than the value I'm seeking for the product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still allows for a good deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for.  What do you think?
