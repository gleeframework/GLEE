"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm confident you'll get a lot of use out of it.  I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. However, there's still room for negotiation. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $17,000? That would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $10,000 is a significant drop. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a price I'm more comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. While $13,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a bit more. Would you be willing to do $15,500?  That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you mentioned that was your final offer, but I'm hoping we can still find a price that works for both of us. I can go up to $14,000. Let me know if that's possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tough one. Bob is getting very close to my guaranteed price with John.  I need to decide if I want to risk losing the extra $1,000 to try and get a bit more from Bob.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While I could try to squeeze a bit more from Bob, there's a real chance he walks away.  The guaranteed $15,000 from John is a safe bet at this point in the negotiation."
