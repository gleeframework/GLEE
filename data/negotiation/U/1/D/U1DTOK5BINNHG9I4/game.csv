"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm confident you'll get a lot of use out of it.  I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $17,000? That would be a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $10,000 is a significant drop. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a price I'm more comfortable with.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. While $13,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a bit more. Would you be willing to do $15,500?  That's my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you mentioned that was your final offer, but I'm hoping we can still find a price that works for both of us. I can go up to $14,000. Let me know if that's possible.",14000.0,Bob,6,
