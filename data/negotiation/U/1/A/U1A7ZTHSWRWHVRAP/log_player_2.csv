"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to invest at a lower price point, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your transparency, and I'm glad you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go down to $1,000,000.  It's better to cut losses and buy from John at the price you know you can get."
