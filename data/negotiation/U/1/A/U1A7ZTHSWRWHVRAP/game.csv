"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point.

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to invest at a slightly lower price point. Would you be willing to consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to invest at a lower price point, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,000,000.  If you're willing to come down to that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your transparency, and I'm glad you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.
