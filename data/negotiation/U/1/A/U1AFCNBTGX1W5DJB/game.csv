"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $11,500?  That gives us both a good deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $11,500 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about $11,000? That's closer to your offer, and it's still a good price for me.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down. I'm willing to go up to $10,900.  That's a fair offer considering the market value.",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $10,900 is still a little lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it'll allow us to close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,7,
