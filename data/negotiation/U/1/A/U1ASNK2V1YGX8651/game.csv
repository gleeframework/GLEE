"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will be a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I'm interested in the product, $20,000 is a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $17,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",17000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $17,000. I appreciate your consideration of the product's value. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $19,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's worth a bit more than that. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a bit more, but $19,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $18,000.  Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?",18000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my desired price. How about we meet at $19,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and your budget.",19500.0,Alice,5,
