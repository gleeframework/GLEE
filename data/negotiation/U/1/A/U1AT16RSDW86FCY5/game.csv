"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'm happy to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. How about $100?  I believe this price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $105? It's still a bit lower than my initial offer, but it's closer to what I'm looking for.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $102.50. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $102.50. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. How about we meet at $107.50? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but it's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept.",107.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $107.50 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us to both walk away happy.  Let me know if you accept.",105.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already made a significant concession. I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",108.0,Alice,9,
