"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $12,000 from John. Alice's offer is better than that, but there's still room for negotiation. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $10,000.  Offering $10,500 is a good starting point for negotiation. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and leaves some room for bargaining. It also demonstrates a serious interest in buying the product while still being below your maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but closer to what I'm willing to pay. However, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer gives me another chance to try and get a lower price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but her offer is still a bit too high. Offering $10,800 is a compromise, showing my willingness to meet her halfway while still keeping the price within my budget. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince her to accept, as it's a significant discount from her previous offer and still above her minimum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation aren't worth the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer. Buying from John guarantees I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with, even if it's not the absolute lowest possible. It's time to secure the purchase and move on."
