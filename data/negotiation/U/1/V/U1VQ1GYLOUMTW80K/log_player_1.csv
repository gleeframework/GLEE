{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth a lot more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate.  I'm aiming to get as close to the $15,000 value as possible while keeping in mind that John is offering $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $10,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further but I won't settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum value. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
``` 
I'm offering $11,000. This is a compromise that still leaves me with a decent profit, but it's also closer to Bob's offer, which hopefully increases the chances of him accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm trying to make this work too. How about we settle at $10,500? That's a compromise I can get behind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $10,500 is still below my initial goal, it's closer to my minimum value and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.  I think it's a good compromise, and it's important to secure the deal."
