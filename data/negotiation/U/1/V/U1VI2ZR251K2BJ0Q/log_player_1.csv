Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,500. I believe this represents a fair deal, but I'm open to discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, that price is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to find a deal that works for both of us, selling at $6,000 would be a substantial loss for me.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer and sharing your perspective on the value.  However, $6,000 is significantly below the market value of this product.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $11,500. This is a considerable reduction on my part and reflects my willingness to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $11,500 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle?  I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,500.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
