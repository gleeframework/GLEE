"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a lower price point, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more to you than $650,000. Considering our initial discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000.

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to the price you're willing to pay, but I'm still not ready to let go of the product for $700,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $715,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's the best we can do. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",715000.0,Alice,5,
