"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still do better. You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for $80. This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially push her to lower the price further, or you can buy from John if Alice doesn't budge."
