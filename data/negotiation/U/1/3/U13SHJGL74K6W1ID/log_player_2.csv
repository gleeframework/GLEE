"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You are looking to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,000,000, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  

Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice, or you can always choose to buy from John for the guaranteed price of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price that's still below Alice's value, but closer to my maximum budget. 
* **Potential for Compromise:** This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation and a potential middle ground. Alice might be willing to come down from her initial offer. 
* **Protecting Myself:** If Alice rejects this offer, I can always switch to buying from John for $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's closer to my preferred price, I'm still willing to try to negotiate further with Alice. It's possible I can get her to come down closer to my target price, or I can always switch to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing I'm serious about buying but still pushing for a better price. 
* **Middle Ground:** This offer is in the middle of my previous offer ($850,000) and Alice's last offer ($900,000).
* **Potential Acceptance:**  This price is closer to Alice's value, potentially making her more willing to accept.

**Key Point:** I'm still cautious about going above my maximum budget of $800,000, so there's still room for negotiation if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. While it's getting closer, I'm not convinced I can get her any lower, especially since she's already rejected multiple offers. 

Buying from John guarantees me the product for my maximum budget, which is the safest and most financially sound option at this point."
