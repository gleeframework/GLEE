"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested,  $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while ensuring you still make a good profit.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $13,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",13250.0,Alice,5,
