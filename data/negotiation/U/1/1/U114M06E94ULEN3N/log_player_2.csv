"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for under $120. Alice's initial offer of $170 is far too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to start the negotiation by making a significant counteroffer.  $100 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $170, and it's also below Bob's maximum price of $120. This sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $140 is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still too high. Bob has 7 rounds left, so there's still room for negotiation.  He should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now getting closer to his maximum price of $120. This counteroffer shows he's serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal. The $110 price point is a compromise that might be acceptable to Alice, especially with limited rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $130 is just $10 above Bob's maximum price of $120.  With only 5 rounds left, it's getting risky to continue negotiating. It's likely that Alice won't budge much further, and Bob may end up having to buy from John at $120.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget."
