Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. While John guarantees $150, there's a chance to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below Bob's perceived value ($100) might seem tempting, but it leaves potential profit on the table.  A price of $140 is still a significant markup from your minimum ($150) and gives Bob a perceived ""discount.""
* **Time Sensitivity:** By mentioning a ""limited time,"" it might encourage Bob to make a decision sooner rather than later."
