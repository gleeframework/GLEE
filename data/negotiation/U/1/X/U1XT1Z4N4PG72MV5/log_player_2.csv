"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Let's start with my offer: $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $110, it's reasonable to try and negotiate a lower price.  There are 9 more rounds to try, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering gives Bob a chance to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $105 for the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his maximum value ($120) as possible.  Offering $105 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and shows Bob is serious about negotiating.  This offer is also above Alice's minimum value of $100, leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that could work for both of us. My counteroffer is $107 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $107, which is closer to Bob's counteroffer of $105.  This is a good deal for Bob as he can save $13 compared to buying from John.  There are still rounds remaining, but the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal to John outweighs the potential of saving a few more dollars.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
