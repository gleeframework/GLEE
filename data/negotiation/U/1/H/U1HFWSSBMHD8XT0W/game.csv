"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,700,000. I believe this price is fair, reflecting the value for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,700,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 is closer, it's still above my limit.  I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits us both.  I'm offering $1,850,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
