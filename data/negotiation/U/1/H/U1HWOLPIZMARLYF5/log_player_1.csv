"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm sure you'll love it! My asking price is $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, knowing that I have room to negotiate. I'm also trying to build rapport by emphasizing the product's value and using a friendly tone.  We'll see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get more from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher than $100. How about $125?  This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 
I'm lowering my price from $150 to $125, showing flexibility. However, I'm still holding out for a better price than Bob's initial offer. I'm also reminding him of the product's value and highlighting the deal. Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but based on my budget, I can offer $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating, Bob's offer of $110 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  To avoid risking a deal with John, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product."
