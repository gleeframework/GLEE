"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me.  This product is truly valuable and I believe a price of $13,000 reflects that value better.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $13,000 is still outside my price range. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This allows for a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. How about we split the difference and land at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,6,
