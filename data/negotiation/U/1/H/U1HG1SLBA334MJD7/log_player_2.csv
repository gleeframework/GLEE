"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a special opportunity tailored for someone like you who appreciates the value this product brings. Let's make it happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the special pricing, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This still allows us to both benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $13,000**. This is still within Bob's budget of $15,000.
* **Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.**  While he could potentially try to negotiate a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, leaving Bob to buy from John at $15,000.
* **Accepting the offer at $13,000 is a good compromise** and saves Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John."
