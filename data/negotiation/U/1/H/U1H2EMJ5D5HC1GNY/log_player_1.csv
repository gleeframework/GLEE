Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price given the value it holds for both of us. I'm confident you'll see the benefits of this deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement. How about we aim for a price closer to $1,250,000? I understand the value of the product to you, and I'm willing to pay a reasonable amount for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 9 more rounds to reach a more favorable price, and I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum value.  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob or secure the $1,500,000 from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still gives you a good deal, considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I think we can still find a compromise. How about we aim for $1,500,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. While I would ideally prefer a higher price, it's a good deal considering I'm guaranteed a sale and don't have to risk further negotiation. This avoids the chance of losing the deal to another buyer or facing multiple rounds of counteroffers that might lead to a lower price."
