"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it allows room for negotiation. I'll see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $130. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $110 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, I might not get a better one, and I'm already on round 4.  It's safer to accept and secure the sale."
