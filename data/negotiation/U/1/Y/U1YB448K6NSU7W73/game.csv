"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I think that's a more reasonable price considering its worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $1,350,000?  This still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. Can you consider that?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
