{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than the product's value to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. However, it's also above my minimum price, ensuring I don't sell myself short."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $10,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise at $11,000. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
