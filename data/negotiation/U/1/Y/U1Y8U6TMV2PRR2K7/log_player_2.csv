"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $10,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise at $11,000. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is still a good deal for Bob. Buying from John for $15,000 would cost Bob significantly more.  While further negotiation could potentially get the price lower, there is a risk Alice will reject and Bob would then be forced to pay $15,000 to John.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good price and avoids unnecessary risk."
