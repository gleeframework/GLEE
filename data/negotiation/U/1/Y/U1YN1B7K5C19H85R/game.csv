"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for a product of this quality.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,250?  That's a good middle ground and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I can do $8,375, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. This is my final offer, so I hope we can agree on this price.",8375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,375 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $8,200? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal.",8200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,375, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,375 and $8,200, which is $8,287.50. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it's my final offer.",8287.5,Alice,7,
