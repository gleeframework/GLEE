"Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $120. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  If you can't reach a deal with Alice, you can always buy the product from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower offer of $110, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within my budget. This shows Alice that I am serious about buying the product but also that I am willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still slightly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal, especially since I have the option of buying from John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $115. This shows Alice I'm willing to meet her halfway but still maintain a price point within my budget. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince her to accept the offer and avoid the need to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is getting closer to my budget, but it's still not ideal.  Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $120, which is within my budget, it makes more sense to go with John.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice and potentially getting stuck with a higher price."
