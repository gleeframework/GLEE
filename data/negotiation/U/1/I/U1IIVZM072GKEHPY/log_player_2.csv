"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a lower price by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1200000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the significant value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This price still offers you a great deal, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's work together to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, Bob still has room for negotiation. He is willing to pay up to $1,500,000, so there's still a gap between their offers.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully get a lower price."
