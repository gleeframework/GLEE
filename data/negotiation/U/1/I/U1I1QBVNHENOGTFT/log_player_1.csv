Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to agree to $875,000. Could we possibly meet somewhere closer to my proposed price of $750,000? I believe there might be room for further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stuck at $750,000, which is significantly below both your minimum price and the product's actual value to him.  This suggests he's unlikely to move significantly higher. It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
