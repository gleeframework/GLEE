"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we start at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $650,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  That gives us both some room to work with.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $925,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $750,000? That's a significant jump on my end, and I think it's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet halfway at $825,000. It's a significant concession on my end, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.  What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
