{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175:** This price is above Bob's value of $100, but it leaves some room for negotiation. It's also significantly less than the $150 value I have for the product.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  Starting higher than Bob's value allows for negotiation space and a chance to get closer to my desired price.
* **Keep the negotiation open:** A friendly tone encourages Bob to counter-offer instead of simply rejecting the offer, keeping the negotiation going.
* **Maintain a fallback option:**  The knowledge that I can sell to John for $150 allows me to be firm during the negotiation and walk away if Bob's counteroffers aren't acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. It's also well below the $175 I initially offered, showing that he's likely aiming for a very low price. While I could accept and earn something, it's not worth sacrificing a significant portion of my desired profit.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value or at least a price that allows for further negotiation. I'll need to be careful not to push him away entirely, but also need to ensure I don't lose too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $125 is a compromise between my initial offer of $175 and Bob's offer of $80. It's significantly higher than his offer, but also lower than my desired price.
* **Message:** I aim to be friendly but firm. I point out that $125 is a good deal for him while also emphasizing that it's closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while pushing for a more favorable price for me. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain momentum:**  Rejecting Bob's low offer shows that I'm not desperate for a sale and willing to negotiate. 
* **Find a middle ground:** The counteroffer creates a potential compromise point.
* **Avoid alienating Bob:** The friendly tone and ""meeting in the middle"" approach encourages Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my offer.  While $125 is closer, I'm still aiming for something below $100.  Would you be willing to do $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is closer to my minimum value of $150 than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum. Selling for $95 would be a loss for me, as I'm only earning $5 more than I would if I sold it to John.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'll aim for a price that's closer to my minimum value, but I'll need to be careful not to push Bob away.  I might consider offering a price slightly below $100 to try and find a compromise point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. While I can't go as low as $95, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $105 is slightly below my minimum value, but it's a compromise that's still within my acceptable range. It's also just above Bob's latest offer of $95, which shows that I'm willing to meet him halfway. 
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's desire for a good price and use phrases like ""fair price"" and ""good deal"" to emphasize the value of the product. I also try to encourage him to accept the offer by highlighting the compromise I've made.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding a compromise:**  $105 is a potentially acceptable price for both of us, allowing for a possible agreement. 
* **Avoiding a stalemate:**  My counteroffer demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate, reducing the risk of the negotiation stalling.
* **Balancing profit and deal:**  While $105 is below my desired price, it's significantly higher than Bob's offer and still allows me to make a profit."
