"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is only worth $120 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $150. It's more beneficial to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. How about we meet in the middle at $137.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5

``` 

While $137.5 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum value of $120.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
