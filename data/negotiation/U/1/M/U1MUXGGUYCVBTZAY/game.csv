"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. My asking price is $950000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm happy to negotiate further. However, $850000 is significantly lower than the value I'm seeking.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which still allows for a good margin for both of us.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. However, $900000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $875000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
