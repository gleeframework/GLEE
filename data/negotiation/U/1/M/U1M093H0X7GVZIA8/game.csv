"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145? I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $130 is just too far below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle at $140.  I'm sure you'll agree it's still a great value for this product.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to make a deal, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll make a new offer of $125. Can you consider that?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $125 is still below what I can accept. Let's try $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $128. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Can you consider it?",128.0,Bob,8,
