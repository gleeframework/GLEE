"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This is still higher than my valuation of $8,000, but I believe it's a fair compromise given the value you place on it.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $9,500 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $10,500 for the product. This is still higher than my valuation, but I believe it's a reasonable compromise given the value you place on it.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to negotiate, but $10,500 is still not a price I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $10,750 as a final offer. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best we can do. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $10,250 for the product. This is still higher than my valuation, but I believe it's a reasonable compromise given the value you place on it.",10250.0,Bob,6,
