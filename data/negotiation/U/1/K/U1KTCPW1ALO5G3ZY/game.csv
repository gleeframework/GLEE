"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet. I can offer it to you for $11,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,5,
