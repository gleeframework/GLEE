"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?  This product truly is exceptional and will deliver significant value.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer, but $1,750,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $1,400,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value it brings.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product and leaves us both with a fair deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,550,000? It seems like a fair compromise.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
