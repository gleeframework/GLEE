"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I understand the value of the product, however, I believe your initial offer is a bit high for me.  I would be willing to purchase the product for a price of $600,000.  Please let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to accept $700,000 for the product?  I believe that's a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000.",850000.0,Alice,5,
