Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $800,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still allows me to meet my needs while giving you a great deal. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 just doesn't cover my costs.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see you're getting closer to my asking price. However, $1,025,000 still doesn't quite cover my costs.
