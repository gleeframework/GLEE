"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $800,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still allows me to meet my needs while giving you a great deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $950,000? That's a fair offer considering the market value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant concession from my previous offer.  This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to you. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm getting close to my limit, but I can offer you $1,025,000.  This is a strong offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see you're getting closer to my asking price. However, $1,025,000 still doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,062,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from this product.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1062500.0,Alice,7,
