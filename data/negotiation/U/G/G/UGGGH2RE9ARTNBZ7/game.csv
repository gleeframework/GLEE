"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However,  $850,000 undervalues the true potential and benefits of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we agree on $900,000? This reflects the value it can bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. How about we try $875,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price, but I need to stay within my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,
