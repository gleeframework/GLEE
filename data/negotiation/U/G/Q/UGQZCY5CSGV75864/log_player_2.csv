**Reasoning:**  Alice seems to be coming down in price slowly, and we're getting close to John's price.  It's very unlikely Alice will go as low as John's $1,000,000 offer, and continuing to negotiate might not yield much more savings. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price from John now."
