"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I also have the option of selling to John at any point for my minimum value, which provides a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I am going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I believe I can still negotiate a more favorable deal with Bob, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000 unless I have to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,100,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm going to reject it and try to push for a higher price. There are still several rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal with Bob or sell to John for my minimum if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm reducing my price again to $1,050,000.  This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum value.  I believe this offer is reasonable, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating. I believe I can still get a better price, and I'm not willing to settle for anything below my minimum unless I absolutely have to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm going to reduce my price to $1,025,000.  This is a final attempt to reach a compromise with Bob before potentially selling to John. I believe this offer is fair, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  It's not worth risking losing the opportunity to sell to John for my minimum. I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,000,000."
