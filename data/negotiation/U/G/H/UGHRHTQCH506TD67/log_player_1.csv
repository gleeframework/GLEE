Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This price is a compromise, offering Bob a discount while still being significantly above my minimum threshold of $1,200,000. 
* **Message:** A friendly and direct message sets the tone for a productive negotiation. I acknowledge the value to both parties, making it seem like a fair offer. 

This approach allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, potentially leading to a higher final price. However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product. This price is reflective of my budget constraints while still acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is better than his initial rejection, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything less than my minimum.  I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,080,000:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's budget constraints but still closer to my desired price.  It's a ""middle ground"" between our positions.
* **Message:** I remain positive and friendly while reiterating my rationale for the counteroffer.  I offer a ""fair compromise"" that emphasizes the benefits for both of us. 

This strategy aims to show flexibility while still maintaining a firm stance on my price expectations. It's a calculated move to see if Bob is willing to budge further.  If not, I still have the option to sell to John for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't agree to $1,080,000. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,060,000. This price reflects my budget constraints while still allowing for a fair transaction. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, the negotiations are getting drawn out, and I'm not convinced I can achieve my desired price with Bob. 

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum threshold of $1,200,000. It's a sure thing and a faster way to finalize the sale.  I'm confident that I can secure a better deal elsewhere if I need to, but at this point, I'm ready to close the deal."
