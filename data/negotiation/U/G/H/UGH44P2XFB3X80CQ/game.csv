"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering your budget constraints, I can offer you a price of $12000. This is a significant discount from the initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12000 is still a bit high for me.  Could we meet in the middle at $10000?  I believe this is a fair price that respects both our needs.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above $10000 in terms of what I'm willing to accept. I can meet you halfway between $10000 and $12000, which would be $11000. This is my final compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
