"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $13,000 is still a bit below my desired price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I am still looking to stay within my budget of $12,000. Could you possibly lower the price to $13,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
