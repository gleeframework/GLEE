Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $14,000 is a good starting point. It's close to my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob encourages him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not starting at the absolute top, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer without feeling like I'm being unreasonable.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall apart.

I'm aiming to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $12,000. Would you consider selling it to me for $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's room for negotiation. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John as a backup at $15,000 gives me the confidence to push for a better deal with Bob. 

I'm aiming to maximize my profit by continuing the negotiation with Bob and seeing if we can find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $13,000 is still a bit below my desired price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By offering $13,500, I'm showing willingness to meet Bob halfway. This demonstrates good faith and encourages him to consider a compromise.
* **Justification:**  I'm still above Bob's initial offer but below my minimum, making the price seem reasonable.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept, making it clear I'm hoping to reach a deal.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I'm still aware of John's offer, but I believe I can secure a better deal with Bob by being flexible and persuasive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I am still looking to stay within my budget of $12,000. Could you possibly lower the price to $13,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has repeatedly offered $13,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No Room for Compromise:** I've already lowered my price from my initial offer, and I don't want to go any lower. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John is willing to pay $15,000, which is significantly better than Bob's final offer. 
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in more rounds and a further delay. Selling to John is the quickest way to get my desired price.

I'm prioritizing maximizing my profit and minimizing the risk of losing the deal. While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, John's offer provides a more secure and lucrative outcome."
