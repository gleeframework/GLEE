"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $500,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  How about we settle at $600,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $600,000. I'm willing to meet you at $650,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other options. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
