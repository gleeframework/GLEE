"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Could we work something closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. My counteroffer is $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While I recognize its value, $900,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is still a bit too high for you. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. My counteroffer is $850,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. My counteroffer is $800,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.",800000.0,Alice,7,
