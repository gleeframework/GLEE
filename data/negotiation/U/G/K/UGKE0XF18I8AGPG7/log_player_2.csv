Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer. I can do $10,500, but I need to make a bit more than that to meet my minimum. How about we do $10,750? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","This is getting tricky. Alice is pushing hard and using ""final offer"" tactics. It's likely she won't go much lower. 

Let's consider:

* **Accepting:** We get a decent deal at $10,750. 
* **Rejecting:**  We risk Alice walking away, forcing us to buy from John at $15,000. 

Weighing the risk, it's probably safer to accept now.
