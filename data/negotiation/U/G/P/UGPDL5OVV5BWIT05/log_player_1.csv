"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is interested in this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm countering with $135. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $125.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial price, it's getting late in the negotiation, and $125 is a good price.  I'm not sure I can get a better offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk selling to John for $100."
