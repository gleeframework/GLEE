"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential benefits. I'm confident we can find an agreement that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Is this something we can work with?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,500,000. This allows you to acquire a valuable asset while still staying within your financial boundaries.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement. While I appreciate your interest, $1,100,000 simply isn't enough for me to part with this product. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're making a final concession, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is as high as I'm willing to go.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
