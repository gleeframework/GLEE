"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while also allowing me to save some money. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $12,500? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
