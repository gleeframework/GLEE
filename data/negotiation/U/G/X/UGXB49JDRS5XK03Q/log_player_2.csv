I'm starting with my maximum price, hoping to get a deal quickly. If Alice rejects, I'll reconsider buying from John."

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but still staying well below Alice's price.  Hopefully, this shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to walk away if she's unreasonable."
