"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This item holds immense value for me, but its potential and significance for you are unparalleled. After careful consideration, I propose a transaction where you can own this masterpiece for $1,200,000. This price reflects the balance between my desire to ensure a fair return for my investment and the substantial value this product holds for you. I believe this offer presents a unique chance for both of us to benefit from this remarkable asset. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $1,200,000. 
* **You can get the product for a lower price from John.** While John's price is higher than your ideal, it's still better than Alice's offer. 
* **Negotiating with Alice might be possible, but it's not guaranteed.** It's better to secure the product from John and potentially negotiate with Alice later if needed."
