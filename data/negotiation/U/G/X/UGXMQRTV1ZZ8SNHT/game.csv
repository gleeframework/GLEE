"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to consider this price? I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a decision soon.",10000.0,Bob,4,
