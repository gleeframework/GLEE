"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit over my budget at $16,500. How about $15,500?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close the deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
