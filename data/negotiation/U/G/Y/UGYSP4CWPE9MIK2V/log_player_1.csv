Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

We're getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still willing to hold out for a better offer from Bob. There's still a significant gap between his offer and John's guaranteed price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Exceeds Bob's Valuation:**  Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating he values the product. Getting him to go beyond his perceived value ($800,000) is a win.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now brings in the money sooner. Delaying for a potentially small gain with Bob has diminishing returns.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's no guarantee Bob will offer more. Continuing the negotiation has the risk of losing him and settling for John's offer, which is only slightly higher.

Accepting $1,300,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the potential downsides of further negotiation."
