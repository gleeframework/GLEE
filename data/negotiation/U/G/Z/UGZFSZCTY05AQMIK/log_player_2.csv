"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $11,000.  He should reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price.  There's still room for negotiation before he has to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to $10,500.  This product provides immense value, and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for Bob. He values the product at $12,000, and he can get it from Alice for $1,500 less. It's better than dealing with John and paying $12,000."
