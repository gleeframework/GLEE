"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.  What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, recognizing its value to you and my own budget constraints. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $1,200,000. This offer keeps in mind the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This offer takes into account your value of the product and my budget. I believe it's a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
