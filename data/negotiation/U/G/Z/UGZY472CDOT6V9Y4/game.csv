"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1300000. This is a fair starting point, considering its value to you is $1200000. I'm open to discussing further, but I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Considering the product's value to me and my budget, I'd be willing to pay $1250000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1290000. This price is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
