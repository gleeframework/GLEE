{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high.  As Bob, you want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer of $700,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer. It's a bold move, but it demonstrates Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal. While $700,000 is still above Alice's minimum of $800,000, it leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price range. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating to try and get a better price. There's still time to make a counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's previous offer but still lower than Alice's latest offer. It shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a better price. This offer is also closer to Alice's minimum price point, increasing the chances of her accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's closer to Bob's target range, it's still not a deal that saves him enough money. Bob should continue to negotiate. It's important to remember that Bob has a safety net in John, which gives him more leverage in these negotiations. There are still rounds to go, and Bob can continue to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a final attempt to reach a compromise with Alice. It's a significant increase from Bob's last offer but still below Alice's latest offer. It shows a willingness to meet halfway while still trying to secure a price that's beneficial for Bob. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob might seriously consider buying from John, as the remaining rounds might not be enough to get a significantly lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high. We are already in Round 7, and only 3 rounds left to negotiate. Even if we continue to negotiate, it is unlikely that Alice will come down to a price that is significantly better than John's offer.  To avoid further risks, it is time to buy the product from John for $1,500,000."
