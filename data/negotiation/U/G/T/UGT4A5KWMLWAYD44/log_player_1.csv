Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 (from John). This is your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $300,000 if he buys it from you for his maximum price.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer, and you don't know how much Bob is actually willing to pay.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Aiming too high risks losing him to your backup offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and exclusivity.
* **Price:** $1,350,000 leaves Bob with a $150,000 potential profit â€“ a significant incentive to accept.  

**Why this offer is strong:**

* **Strong but Fair:**  It positions the price significantly above your minimum while still offering Bob a very attractive deal.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong opening offer, there's some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations. If you had more insights into Bob, you might adjust your approach."
