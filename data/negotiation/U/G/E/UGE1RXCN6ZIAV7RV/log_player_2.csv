"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $150. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $150 seems a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $115 is still a little too steep for me.  Would you be willing to do it for $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I'm willing to go down to $105, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below her stated ""final offer"" of $105. Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, it makes more sense to do that and save the extra $5."
