Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140.  This gives me a good profit margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob, since the product is worth $120 to him.  I'm confident that we can negotiate a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering with $125. This is still a good profit margin for me, but it's closer to Bob's offer and shows I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to him, and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made two counteroffers, and it seems like Bob isn't willing to come up much higher.  To avoid further negotiation and secure a guaranteed profit, I'll sell the product to John for $120."
