"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell for such a low amount, and I believe I have room to negotiate further.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my target price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that's within my budget and reflects the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm not yet ready to settle for that amount. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm also mindful of the time limit, and I don't want to get stuck in a drawn-out negotiation.  I'll see if I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  I'll offer you the product for $9,500. This represents a significant discount for me, and it's also a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $9,500 is still a little higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm prepared to go to $9,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me and allows for a smooth transaction. Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,250 is tempting and gets closer to my target, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially with only a few rounds left. I'll counter with a slightly higher price and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement. I'm also mindful of the option to sell to John for $15,000, which gives me a safety net if this negotiation fails."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm determined to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $9,375? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9375}
