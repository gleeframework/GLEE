"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Given its potential worth to your business, I believe this is a very competitive offer.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $950,000 is a significant difference from what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle a bit â€“ how about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $1,050,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $980,000?",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $980,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price point. How about we settle at $1,020,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but I still think $1,020,000 is a bit steep. How about $990,000?",990000.0,Bob,6,
