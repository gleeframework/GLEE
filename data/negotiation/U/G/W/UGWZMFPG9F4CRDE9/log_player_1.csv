Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that your asking price is justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" and asking for Bob's ""thoughts"" signals that you're open to discussing the price and potentially negotiating.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  There's a chance Bob might accept the $15,000 price.
2. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His response will give you insight into how badly he wants the product and how much he's willing to pay.

You have a safety net with John, so you can afford to negotiate strategically with Bob."
