"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my initial offer.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go down to $9,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to your initial offer and allows me to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I'm willing to go down to $9,250, which is still a good price for both of us. I believe this is a fair compromise.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $9,250 is closer to what I can afford, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  Would you consider $9,100? This would allow me to move forward with the purchase and still give you a good profit. What do you think?",9100.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much profit. I'm willing to go down to $9,150, which is still a good price for both of us. I believe this is a fair compromise.",9150.0,Alice,7,
