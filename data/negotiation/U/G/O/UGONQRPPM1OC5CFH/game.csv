"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $200 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $150? I'm really interested in the product, but that's my budget.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $150 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $175?  It's still a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,3,
