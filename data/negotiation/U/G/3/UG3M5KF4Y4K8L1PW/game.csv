"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair offer, and I'm sure we can both agree that it's a win-win situation.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is a fair price that balances out the value of the product for both of us. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
