Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $100 is a good middle ground between your minimum price ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($120).
* **Shows you're willing to compromise:** It demonstrates that you're not starting at a ridiculously high price, making Bob more likely to engage in a conversation.
* **Sets a clear expectation:** It establishes a specific price for the product, making it easier to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's worth trying to get a little closer to your desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? It's still a great deal for you, and I can make it work on my end."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $80 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  It's better to secure the sale now and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price.  Additionally, there's a chance Bob might not budge further, and I'd be stuck selling to John for $80."
