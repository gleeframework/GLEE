Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,800,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1,600,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're a serious buyer, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,500,000. However, I've had other interested parties, and I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. How about we do $1,520,000? It's a slight increase from your offer, but I think it's worth it for this exceptional product.
