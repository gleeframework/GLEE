"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. Considering the product's worth to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.
