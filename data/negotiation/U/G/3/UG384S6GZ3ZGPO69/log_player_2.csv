"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. You should definitely counter-offer to try and get closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $60 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price and your actual budget limit, it's a strong opening move in negotiation. It leaves room to gradually increase your offer while gauging Alice's flexibility.
* **Expressing Interest:**  The message emphasizes that you're genuinely interested in the product, which might encourage Alice to consider a lower price.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The phrase ""around $60"" suggests some flexibility on your end, inviting Alice to counter-propose a price closer to your range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. However, $60 is quite low for me. Could you consider $100? That's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $100 is still above your $80 maximum budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's space to negotiate further. Alice seems open to a deal but is likely trying to secure the highest possible price.  It's worth seeing if you can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $100 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still working with a tight budget. Could you do $70? I think that's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  You're moving closer to a possible agreement by increasing your offer to $70. This shows Alice you're willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $70 puts you in a strong position. It's right in the middle of your initial offer ($60) and Alice's counteroffer ($80).
* **Justification:**  Mentioning your budget reinforces your position and makes your offer seem more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $85? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Over Budget:** Alice's final offer of $85 is still above your maximum budget of $80. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80, which is within your budget.
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:** There's no assurance that Alice will come down further, even with more negotiation. 

At this point, it's strategically the best choice to take the guaranteed deal from John and avoid potentially overspending."
