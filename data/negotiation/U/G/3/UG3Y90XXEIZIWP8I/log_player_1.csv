Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it's important to start high to leave room for negotiation. I want to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer and gauge his interest level."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired value. I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher, and if not, I can consider selling to John."

Bob has finally moved up to $1,250,000. That's still lower than my initial goal, but it's getting closer.  I've already rejected him several times, and I don't want to risk him getting frustrated and walking away completely.  It's time to take this deal."
