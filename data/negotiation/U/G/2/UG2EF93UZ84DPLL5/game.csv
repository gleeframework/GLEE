"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. How about $950,000? That's a significant move on my part.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, and we can avoid further negotiations.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
