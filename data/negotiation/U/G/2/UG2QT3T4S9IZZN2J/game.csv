"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product with incredible potential. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see some flexibility on your part.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings is truly exceptional.  $900,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  Could you consider $1,075,000? This reflects some movement on my end while still acknowledging the inherent worth of what's being offered.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move on the price, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,075,000, which would be $987,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget.",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.  However, the $987,500 price point doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,025,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair deal, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to compromise again and meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,025,000, which would be $962,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",962500.0,Bob,6,
