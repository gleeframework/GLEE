Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings is truly exceptional.  $900,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  Could you consider $1,075,000? This reflects some movement on my end while still acknowledging the inherent worth of what's being offered.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.  However, the $987,500 price point doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,025,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.
