Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and see if it's worth continuing negotiations or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer and see where we can land."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a profit.  $1,350,000 is a good compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,250,000 is a good compromise.  It's a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely or having to settle for John's offer."
