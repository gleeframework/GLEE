Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum of $100 and leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a decent deal since the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer for $110. Although I would prefer more, it's still above my minimum of $100 and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly higher price."
