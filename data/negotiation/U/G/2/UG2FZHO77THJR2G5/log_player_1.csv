Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product.  However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
