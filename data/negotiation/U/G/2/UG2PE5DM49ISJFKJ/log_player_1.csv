Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  I believe it holds significant value, and this offer stands for a limited time."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to negotiate above that price with Bob. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting at $19,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher profit margin. It's easier to negotiate down than up.
* **Limited Time Element:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob will reject this initial offer. You'll need to decide if you want to negotiate further with him or move on to John."
