{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob's budget.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows the product is worth $800,000 to him. This is his maximum offer, and he is hoping to close the deal quickly.  He is confident Alice will accept this offer since it's still above her minimum price."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, but it's closer to Bob's target price.  Bob is willing to continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal. He also wants to avoid buying from John if he can help it. The potential savings from negotiating further outweigh the risk of losing a round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to show he's willing to compromise but still wants to keep the price below $900,000. He's trying to find a middle ground that is attractive to both parties."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and with only 5 rounds left, the chance of her agreeing to a price lower than $850,000 is getting slim.  Bob doesn't want to risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a higher price. He decides to take the sure thing and buy the product from John for $800,000."
