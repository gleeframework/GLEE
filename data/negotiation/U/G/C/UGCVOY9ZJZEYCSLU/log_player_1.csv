Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, giving him room to negotiate, while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum of $12,000.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $13,000. While it's closer to my minimum of $12,000, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I'll proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $13,000.  I'm hoping this will be a more agreeable price for both of us, moving us closer to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $13,200.  While it's still slightly below my initial target, it's significantly higher than John's offer of $12,000, and I don't want to risk losing a deal with Bob.  It's also close enough to my desired price that I'm comfortable closing the negotiation."
