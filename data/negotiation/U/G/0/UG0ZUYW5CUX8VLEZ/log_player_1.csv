**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge beyond $1,200,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price acceptable to me. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and move on to the guaranteed sale."
