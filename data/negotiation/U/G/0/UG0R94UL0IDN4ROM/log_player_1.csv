Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where I need to make a decision.  Bob's offer of $10,550 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'd like to get.  We've gone through several rounds and it seems like we're stuck.  I don't want to risk going another round and potentially getting an even lower offer.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000 to ensure I don't lose out completely."
