Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,200 is a significant amount for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Although Alice is willing to compromise and come down to $9,500, it's still above Bob's budget. He has a guaranteed deal with John at his desired price, so it's best to go with that option."
