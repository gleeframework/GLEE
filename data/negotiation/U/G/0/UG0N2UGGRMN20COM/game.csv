"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,800. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",9800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $9,800 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, which is a significant amount for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,200 is a significant amount for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,5,
