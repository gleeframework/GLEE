Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is way over his budget. He should try to negotiate with Alice and see if he can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a price closer to his target of $8,000."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  While Alice has come down to $11,000, this is still above Bob's target price.  John offers a price that's within Bob's budget, and there's no guarantee that further negotiations with Alice will result in a lower price."
