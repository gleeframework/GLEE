Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,100,000 is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This price is below your minimum threshold of $1,200,000, so you're already willing to take a bit of a loss if Bob accepts.
* **It leaves space for negotiation:**  You have room to lower your price slightly if Bob counters with a lower offer. 

By starting at a high price, you set the tone and demonstrate the product's value while leaving yourself room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum threshold of $1,200,000.  You can still get a better deal by:

* **Negotiating:**  You have room to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to your desired range.
* **Selling to John:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, you have the option to sell to John and secure your minimum price.

**Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing negotiations, you keep the possibility of a better price on the table without sacrificing the safety net of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** This counteroffer is a significant decrease from your initial offer, showing your willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a deal. 
* **Still above your minimum:**  $1,050,000 is still above your minimum threshold of $1,200,000, which means you're still getting a decent price.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  You have room to lower your price slightly if Bob counters again, but you're also getting closer to a potential agreement. 

By meeting Bob halfway, you demonstrate flexibility while also maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, it's clear that Bob is unlikely to meet your minimum threshold of $1,200,000.  While $920,000 is better than nothing, it's still a significant loss for you.

**Selling to John guarantees:**

* **Your minimum price:** You'll secure the $1,200,000 you need, ensuring you don't lose money on the deal.
* **A swift and certain outcome:**  There's no need to continue negotiating with Bob, which could lead to further concessions and a lower price.

By choosing to sell to John, you prioritize your financial security and avoid the risk of a prolonged and potentially unprofitable negotiation with Bob."
