Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer, $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, but still ensures I'm making a significant profit. I'm confident I can get at least $1,000,000 from John if this negotiation fails, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I believe I can do better. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000, which is still a good profit for me and a more reasonable price for Bob. I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that I can get $1,000,000 from John, so I'm going to sell the product to him to avoid further negotiations."
