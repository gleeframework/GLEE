"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to match this price again.",180.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $180 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $145 for the product. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",145.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $145. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a slightly higher offer. I'll sell the product to you for $165. This is my final offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to match this price again.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $165 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $155 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $155 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $160. This is my final offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to match this price again.",160.0,Alice,5,
