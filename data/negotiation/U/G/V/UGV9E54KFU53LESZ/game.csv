"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you could be significant. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the product's worth and allows for some negotiation space. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is certainly a step closer, it's still significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which I believe represents a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but $920,000 is still not in the range I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to go down to $950,000, but this is my final offer. Let's finalize this. ",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking more along the lines of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",925000.0,Bob,6,
