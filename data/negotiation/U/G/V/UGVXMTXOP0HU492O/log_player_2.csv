"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm offering it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While the messaging is a bit vague, $125 is a reasonable price and saves you $25 compared to buying from John."
