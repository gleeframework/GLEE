"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that budget constraints can be a challenge. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more counteroffer, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm still not willing to go above $900000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $900000, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
