"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $160.",160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $160 is a bit steep for me. How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $160 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $145? It's still a great deal for both of us!",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $145 is still a little too high for me.  Let's try $135. I'm really hoping to close this deal, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you a price of $140. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's the best we can do at this point.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $140 is still a bit high for me.  How about $138? This is really my limit, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",138.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get to your limit, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $138. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you a price of $142. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",142.0,Alice,7,
