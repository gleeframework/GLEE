"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product! It's a game-changer in its industry. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a product that's worth a lot more to you than that. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I agree the product looks great, $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,200?",10200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,200. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great price for a product that's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $11,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,600?",10600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,600 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",10800.0,Alice,5,
