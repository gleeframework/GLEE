"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $120, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle at $105?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $92.50. Can you consider that?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $92.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $98.75?  That way, we both get a fair price and can close this deal.",98.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $98.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",95.0,Bob,6,
