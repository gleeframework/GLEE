Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $120, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value to see if I can negotiate upwards. I'm also adding a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $92.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $92.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $98.75?  That way, we both get a fair price and can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 98.75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $98.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
