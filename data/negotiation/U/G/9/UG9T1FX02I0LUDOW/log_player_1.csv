Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000). This sets a high bar and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Unknown Value:** Since I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product, I need to leave some room for negotiation. 
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me a safety net. If Bob rejects my offer, I can always fall back on John. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's reaction. If he rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  Bob's counteroffer shows that he's interested in the product. This opens the door for further negotiation and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  While I'm open to negotiating, I still have John as a backup buyer who will pay my minimum price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,500,000 but still acknowledging Bob's desire to pay less. My goal is to find a compromise that allows me to maximize my profit while ensuring Bob doesn't walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is the midpoint between my initial offer ($1,500,000) and Bob's offer ($800,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my profit margin. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  This counteroffer keeps the price above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  The offer is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, reminding him that I have a fallback option with John. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's reaction. If he rejects the counteroffer, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John. I'll factor in Bob's negotiation tactics and potential willingness to come up in price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, but it's still below it.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  I've already made two counteroffers, and Bob's response suggests he's unlikely to budge much further.  Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a lengthy process with no guarantee of a better outcome.
* **John's Guarantee:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum target and provides a secure and immediate transaction.

**Next Steps:**

I'll contact John and finalize the sale, securing my minimum profit and avoiding further negotiation with Bob."
