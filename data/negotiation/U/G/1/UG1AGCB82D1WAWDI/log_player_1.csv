Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Start with an offer higher than both Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and your minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for the highest possible profit.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning you'll list it publicly implies scarcity and might encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $12,000, the phrasing ""What do you think?"" suggests openness to discussion and potential counter-offers from Bob.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to strike a balance between a high initial offer and a price that's not so high that Bob immediately dismisses it."
