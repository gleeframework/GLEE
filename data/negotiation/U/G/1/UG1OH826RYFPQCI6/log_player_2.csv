"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**  The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to you.  Alice's offer is too high. It's best to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:** I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to establish a lower starting point for negotiation.  Alice might reject this offer, but it will give us a clearer idea of her price range and where we can potentially meet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:** 
While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'll try to push for a lower price by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer to $1,150,000. This is a compromise, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but still trying to get a better price. I'm also getting closer to John's price, which provides a fallback option if I can't get a better deal with Alice."
