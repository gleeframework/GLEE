"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Considering its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what the market suggests. I'm offering it to you for $100. This is a special deal considering your interest in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum price. It's worth negotiating to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $100 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product and your willingness to negotiate, I am willing to accept $95 for the product. This is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is within my budget and represents a good compromise.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice will not go lower, and I risk losing the deal.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price within my budget."
