"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. This price takes into account the value you've mentioned, but also my financial constraints. Would you be willing to consider my revised offer?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
