"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will encourage him to counter-offer and we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm also keeping the message friendly and positive to foster a good relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than his initial $80 valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference at $95?  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds,  $85 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll make another counteroffer and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. How about we compromise at $90? This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's finalize this and avoid wasting more time."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $82.50. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. It's getting very close to the end of our negotiation rounds, and Bob is not budging. I'm confident I won't find a better price with Bob, and John is offering me my minimum acceptable price of $120."
