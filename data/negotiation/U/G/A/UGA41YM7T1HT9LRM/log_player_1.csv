""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** Offering it slightly below $15,000 might make Bob feel like he's getting a small deal.
* **Urgency (Implied):**  While not explicitly stated, the fact that we have another buyer lined up adds subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, by aiming high, we maximize our potential profit."
