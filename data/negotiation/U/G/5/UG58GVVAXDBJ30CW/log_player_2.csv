"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $75.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Offering $60 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $75, and it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $70 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob's goal of buying the product for less than $100. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows for further exploration of lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 65}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Compromise:**  Bob is showing a willingness to compromise by increasing his offer from $60 to $65. 
* **Midpoint:** This price is roughly halfway between Alice's current offer of $70 and Bob's previous offer of $60. This might encourage Alice to consider accepting.
* **Still Saving:**  $65 is still significantly less than the $100 Bob can pay John, so he's still on track to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is back to her original offer of $75. While it's tempting to take this price, Bob has proven his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown some flexibility. There's still a chance Alice will come down further, especially with a counteroffer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  Bob is again showing a willingness to compromise, this time meeting Alice halfway between her current offer of $75 and his previous offer of $65.
* **Close to Goal:**  $70 is still within Bob's goal of paying less than $100, and it shows a serious commitment to finalizing the deal.
* **Pressure on Alice:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, Alice may feel pressured to accept a price closer to Bob's, or risk losing the sale altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** There are only 3 rounds left. Continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Slight Compromise:** $80 is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still within his budget and represents a compromise from Alice's previous offer of $80.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Accepting the offer guarantees Bob gets the product at a lower price than John. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but it also carries the risk of failing to reach an agreement and having to buy from John."
