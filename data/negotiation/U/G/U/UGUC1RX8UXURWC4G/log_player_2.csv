Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but it's still within my budget and leaves some room for negotiation."

Alice is still asking too much.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $9,000. This is a compromise, but still lower than Alice's latest offer.  We're getting closer, and it's worth seeing if Alice will accept this."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. With only a few rounds left, it's getting too risky to continue negotiating. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John."
