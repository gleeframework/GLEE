"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my minimum of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. It's also closer to Bob's offer, potentially making it more appealing while still giving me a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd ideally get closer to my minimum of $10,000, Bob's offer of $9,000 is a reasonable compromise. Selling to John for $10,000 would be ideal, but there's a risk that the negotiations with Bob could break down, leaving me with nothing. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a good profit."
