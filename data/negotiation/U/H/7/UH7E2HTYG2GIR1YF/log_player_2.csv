"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $10,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above Alice's perceived value of the product. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also demonstrating Bob's serious interest in buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,750. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is within Bob's budget and a significant improvement on her initial offer.  This is a good deal for Bob, saving him $1,250 compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
