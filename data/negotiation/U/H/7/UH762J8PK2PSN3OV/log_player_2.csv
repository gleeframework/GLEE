# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring immense value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can secure a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially save more money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,300,000.  I'm confident this product is valuable to both of us, and I'm willing to pay a fair price.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1350000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value this product brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point. While it's not your ideal price, $1,350,000 is still within your budget and a decent savings compared to buying from John.  It's a good compromise, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result."
