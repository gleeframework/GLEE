"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $9,500. I think it would be a valuable asset to you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by demonstrating Bob's desire to acquire the product while setting a price point significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. It leaves room for further negotiation while still being a reasonable offer considering Alice's own valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product is quite valuable to me. I could meet you halfway at $9,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $10,000.  At this point, there's not much room for further negotiation, and accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
