"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can do $14,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $13,500, and that's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $13,500 is pushing my budget. To be honest, I've found a similar product elsewhere for a better price. I'm willing to offer you $11,000 as a final attempt. If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with the other option.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,7,
