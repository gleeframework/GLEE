"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's a decent markup from my minimum value while still being potentially attractive to Bob. I'll be watching closely to see if he accepts or makes a counteroffer, which will help me gauge his interest and adjust my strategy for the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $175 is better than my minimum, it's still significantly less than my initial offer. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial $200."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $190.  This is a compromise between my initial offer of $200 and Bob's counteroffer of $175. I believe this price is still fair for me while showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It will also help me gauge whether Bob is serious about purchasing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my initial offer, and it's also a good amount above my minimum.  It's important to balance getting the best price with the risk of losing the deal. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a higher price, but it could also lead to Bob walking away entirely. Given that we are in round 4, I'm going to accept this offer and avoid risking further negotiation."
