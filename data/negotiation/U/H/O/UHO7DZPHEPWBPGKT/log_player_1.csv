I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it also ensures I make a profit beyond my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that I can get at least $1,000,000 from John, so I'm willing to risk losing the sale to Bob if he doesn't meet my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept since it's still above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me and I believe it's a reasonable compromise for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not high enough to be worth the risk of continuing to negotiate. At this point, I'm comfortable with the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. There's no guarantee that I can push Bob any higher and I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether."
