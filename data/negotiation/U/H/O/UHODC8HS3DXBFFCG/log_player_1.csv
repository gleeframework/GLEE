Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Scenario**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $10,000 (her fallback price with John).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit margin of $2,000 to be made from Bob.

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice should aim to maximize her profit while ensuring Bob finds the deal acceptable. Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Why this approach?**

* **High but Fair:**  $11,500 is a strong offer for Alice, capturing most of the potential profit.
* **Value for Bob:** Bob still gains $500 in perceived value ($12,000 - $11,500), making it likely he'll accept.
* **Avoids Greed:**  While Alice could push closer to $12,000, it risks Bob rejecting the offer. A slightly lower price increases the chance of a successful sale. 

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice has no information about Bob's financial situation or negotiating tactics beyond his valuation of the product."
