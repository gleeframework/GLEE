Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below my minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer while still ensuring I get more than my minimum if he accepts. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
