Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly higher gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer implies you're open to discussion, making Bob more likely to engage. 
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and your initial asking price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.  It's clear there's a wide gap to bridge, but you have the advantage of knowing John will buy it for your minimum.  It's worth negotiating further before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. To be fair to both of us, I could consider coming down to $1,300,000. This reflects the true value and potential this product offers."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Not Drastic Reduction:** The counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate but maintains a firm stance above your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""fairness"" and ""true value"" reinforces your position without directly dismissing Bob's offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This keeps the negotiation open while moving closer to a potentially acceptable range. It also puts pressure on Bob to make a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does staying within my budget.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say $1,050,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your guaranteed sale price with John.  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and his ""meet in the middle"" language suggests he might be persuaded to go higher. You haven't reached a point where giving up the potential for a higher price with Bob is necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but to make this deal happen, I'd need it to be $1,175,000.  This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1175000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This offer splits the difference between Bob's last offer and your desired price. It shows you're willing to compromise but sets a clear bottom line.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) adds a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly. 
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By stating this is your final offer, you increase the chance Bob will accept rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
