Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a bit above the market value, considering what I've researched. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested.  Let's see if we can push a bit further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $960,000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe it's a fair price for the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000.

While we could try to push for a bit more, $960,000 is a strong offer and significantly above our fallback option (John). Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away in future rounds."
