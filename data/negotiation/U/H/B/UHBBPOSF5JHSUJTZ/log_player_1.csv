Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's in great condition and worth every penny! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob rejects the offer, but it's also a price that's fair considering the product is worth $100 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$80 is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell it for that price.  I'll send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
