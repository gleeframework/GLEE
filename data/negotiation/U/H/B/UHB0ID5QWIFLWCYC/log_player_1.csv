I'm starting high, knowing that the product is worth $1,200,000 to me.  This is my ideal price, and I'm confident that Bob will be motivated to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility while still ensuring I get a good price. I believe this is a fair compromise that Bob might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to accept anything less than $1,000,000.  I'll counteroffer again."

I'm meeting Bob halfway with a price of $1,050,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price but shows my willingness to negotiate further. I hope this will convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer is still below my minimum. At this point, it's clear that we're not going to reach a compromise.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing that by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
