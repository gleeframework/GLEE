You can likely get a better price from Alice, so rejecting her initial offer is the best option."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get the product for a bit closer to $85, but I'm still hoping to get a better price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer of $92.50 is a good deal. It's still within your budget and significantly lower than John's price."
