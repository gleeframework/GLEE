"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget.  Would you consider $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. $10,500 is still below my minimum, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.  I'm not in a rush to sell, and I'd rather try to get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your offer. However, $10,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to find a way to make this work for both of us. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,250? This would allow me to purchase the product while still staying within my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm still holding out for a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with a few more rounds of negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you and I want to make this work, but $10,250 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
