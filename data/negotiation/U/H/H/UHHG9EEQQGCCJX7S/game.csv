"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my minimum value. How about $9,000? This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit shy of that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're committed to finding a solution.  $8,500 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to make one last compromise. I'll accept $9,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal that we can both be happy with. Let me know if you're interested.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on this deal. I'm really interested in the product, but I think I can get a better price from someone else. I'm willing to make one last offer: $8,500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",8500.0,Bob,6,
