"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Confident Tone:**  By expressing confidence in the product's value and the likelihood of a deal, I aim to influence Bob's perception and potentially encourage him to make a strong counteroffer.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I'm aiming high, I'm mindful that I have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price. This knowledge allows me to negotiate with Bob from a position of strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While it's closer to his perceived value, I'm not willing to accept such a substantial loss, especially knowing I have John as a backup option. By rejecting, I signal that I'm serious about negotiating a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my original price is based on a deep understanding of this product's potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this still reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial drop from my initial price to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate more seriously. However, I'm still well above both his offer and my minimum.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's potential, hoping to shift his perception of its worth and justify the higher price.
* **Maintaining Strength:** While I'm open to negotiation, my counteroffer keeps the deal favorable for me and leaves room for further adjustments in later rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my absolute minimum acceptable price and equals what John is willing to pay.  While I could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk of Bob backing out or stalling the negotiation further. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and avoids the potential loss of both buyers."
