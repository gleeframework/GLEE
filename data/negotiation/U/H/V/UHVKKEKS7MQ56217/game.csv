"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
