"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,025,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my part. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential of the product and allows us to both reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here, but $900,000 is just too low. My final offer is $975,000. Take it or leave it - this is the best I can do.",975000.0,Alice,5,
