,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 right now. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $175. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $100. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to move on to another seller.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $150. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,5,
