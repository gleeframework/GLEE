Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to my business.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe the product is worth more, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price still reflects the significant value this product offers, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,400,000, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,350,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise that keeps me above my minimum threshold.  It's also better than selling to John for $1,200,000, and I believe there's a good chance of a profitable relationship with Bob in the future."
