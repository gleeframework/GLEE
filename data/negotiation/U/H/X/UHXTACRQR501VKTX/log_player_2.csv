(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high ($2,000,000) compared to your maximum budget ($1,500,000).  It's also higher than what you're willing to pay from John ($1,500,000).  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
