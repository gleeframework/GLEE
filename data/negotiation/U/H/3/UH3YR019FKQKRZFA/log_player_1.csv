"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very beneficial. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  It's a common negotiation tactic to start with a higher price than you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate down and still feel like you've gotten a good deal.
* **Confidence:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and expresses confidence in Bob's potential to benefit from it. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just the first offer. As the negotiation progresses, you'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's reactions and your own assessment of the situation.
* Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $800,000 at any time. This is your safety net if you feel the negotiation isn't going well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum:**  While $900,000 is significantly less than my initial ask, it's still closer to my minimum of $800,000. This means there's potential for further negotiation.
* **Room for counteroffer:**  I can still increase the price slightly in my counteroffer, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Not selling to John yet:** Selling to John for $800,000 is still a good option, but I'd like to see if I can get a higher price from Bob first.  There's still room for improvement. 

**Next Round:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $900,000. I might aim for $950,000, explaining that while I appreciate Bob's offer, I need to make sure I get a fair price for this unique product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest,  I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $900,000. It's truly unique, and I believe its value to you will be even greater than you initially estimated. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a specific number:** This shows that you are serious about negotiating and are willing to compromise. 
* **Highlight the value:**  The message reiterates the product's unique value to justify the higher price. 
* **Flexibility and compromise:** ""Meeting in the middle"" implies a willingness to negotiate further, while still maintaining a good price.

**Important Note:**

This is a negotiation. You need to be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's reaction and your own assessment of the situation. Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $800,000 at any time if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $920000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It's a good deal considering the negotiation is only in round 4.
* **Limited rounds:** With only 6 rounds left, the risk of getting a better offer from Bob is diminishing. There's also a chance that Bob might walk away if I keep rejecting. 
* **John's offer is still a safety net:** If Bob does walk away, I can always sell to John for $800,000, so there's no significant loss in accepting Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and close the deal. This ensures a sale at a decent price without taking unnecessary risks or prolonging the negotiation."
