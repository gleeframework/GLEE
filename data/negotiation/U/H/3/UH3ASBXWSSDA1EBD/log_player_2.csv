{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my maximum price, but her offer is still too high.  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we're not close to reaching an agreement that benefits both of us. With only one round left, I'm not sure I can get a lower price from Alice. It's safer to buy the product from John at $1,500,000 and avoid the risk of not getting a deal at all."
