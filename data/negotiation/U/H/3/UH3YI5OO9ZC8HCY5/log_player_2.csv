{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Buying from John is always an option.** This provides a safety net if negotiations fail."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low:**  I'm aiming to get the price significantly lower than my maximum budget, leaving room for potential compromises.
* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** $8,000 is still a substantial amount, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying but also pushing for a good deal. 
* **First counteroffer:** I want to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see how much they are willing to budge."

* **Putting the ball in Alice's court:**  I'm showing my sincerity by reaching my limit, hoping Alice will accept.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above my budget.**  I'm not willing to pay more than $10,000.
