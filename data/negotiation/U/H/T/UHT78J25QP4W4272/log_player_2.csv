It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is within my budget and a good deal compared to John's price. Accepting is the best option at this point."
