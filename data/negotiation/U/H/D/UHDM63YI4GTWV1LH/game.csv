"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $900,000?  It's still a great deal for you considering the product's value, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $825,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $862,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",862500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I appreciate the movement you've made.  To bridge the gap, I can offer $843,750.",843750.0,Bob,6,
