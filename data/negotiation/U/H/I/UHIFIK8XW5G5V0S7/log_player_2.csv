"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as low as possible, ideally under $80. Alice's initial offer of $175 is way too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  He acknowledges her offer but emphasizes that it's not in his price range. By offering $85, he's showing he's willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to his maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $120 is still higher than Bob's maximum of $80. While it's a step in the right direction, Bob can still try to get a better deal by rejecting the offer and continuing the negotiation.  He can potentially get closer to his target price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $120 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm  stuck at $95.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of offering prices closer to his maximum while still leaving room for negotiation.  He's trying to find a middle ground between his offer and Alice's previous offer. By mentioning a compromise, he's showing a willingness to negotiate further and hopefully reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to go down to $110, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's work this out, I'm confident we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum of $80. Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate and has a backup option with John. By rejecting the offer, he can potentially secure a better deal in the remaining rounds or choose to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to offer $100.  This feels like a fair price for both of us, considering we're both trying to find a deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also trying to be reasonable. He's offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer, but still within his maximum.  By mentioning ""fair price"" and ""both of us,"" he's trying to create a sense of collaboration and encourage Alice to accept his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still determined to get the product for under $80. While Alice's offer of $105 is tempting, it's still above his maximum.  He has shown persistence in the negotiation and has a guaranteed alternative with John.  There's a chance to get a better deal in the remaining rounds, or he can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  $105 is still a little high for me.  I'm going to offer $98.  I'm really close to my budget, but I believe this is a good compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a final push for a price close to his maximum. He acknowledges Alice's compromise but emphasizes his limited budget. Offering $98 shows a willingness to meet halfway, while still leaving a bit of room for negotiation.  Mentioning ""finalizing the deal"" adds a sense of urgency and encourages Alice to consider his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting close to my limit here, but I'm willing to go down to $102. This is a very fair price, and I'd really like to finalize this deal with you. Let's make it happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $102 is still above Bob's maximum of $80, even though it's a good deal compared to the starting price. With only one round remaining, the chances of getting a lower price from Alice are slim. 

Instead of risking a potential counteroffer from Alice that could be even higher, Bob decides to secure the product from John for $80.  This guarantees him the product at the best possible price, even though it means ending the negotiation with Alice."
