"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. There are still 9 rounds left, and Bob has the option of buying from John for $8,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open for a potentially more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer, hoping to secure a deal closer to his target of $8,000.  This counteroffer establishes a starting point for negotiation and leaves room for compromise in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's target than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his maximum price point of $8,000. There are still 7 rounds left, and Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate or by buying from John for a guaranteed $8,000.  It's worth pushing for a lower price to see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. However, he's still significantly below Alice's current offer. This approach aims to strike a balance between demonstrating good faith and staying within his budget.  It also allows for potential negotiation in the remaining rounds without risking buying from John for the full $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,900 is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still $900 more than he's willing to pay. With five rounds remaining, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. If Alice doesn't budge, he can always buy from John for $8,000 in the final round if necessary.  By rejecting this offer, Bob signals his willingness to walk away if he doesn't get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while remaining within his budget. This counteroffer is only $100 away from Alice's offer, suggesting a possible deal close to being struck. However, Bob still wants to save as much as possible and hasn't reached his maximum price point yet.  With four rounds remaining, there is still room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,850 is only $850 more than Bob's maximum price point, and he has only three rounds left to negotiate.  This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in minor price changes.  By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product for a price that's within his budget and avoids potentially losing the deal to John.  With only three rounds remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate is not worth the potential reward of saving a few hundred dollars."
