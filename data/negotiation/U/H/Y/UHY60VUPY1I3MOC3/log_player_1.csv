Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value and benefits of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While this is a high starting point, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This ensures I have room to negotiate if necessary. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware that Bob might reject my offer, but I'm confident in my plan B: selling to John for $1,500,000. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **I have leverage.**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay my minimum price. This gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.
* **Potential for a better deal.** By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to my desired price while still being within the range that he might find acceptable."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $900,000 is a step closer, it's still not quite in the range I need to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price reflects the product's value while still being fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:**  I'm aiming for a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility while still trying to secure a higher price.
* **Emphasizing value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Fairness and compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a fair compromise to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Plan B still in play:**  I'm still aware of my option to sell to John, which gives me confidence in my negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $950,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Even though Bob is calling it his ""final offer,"" $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Leverage remains:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay my minimum. This gives me the ability to reject Bob's offer without risk.
* **Potential for better deal:** By rejecting, I can make a final counteroffer, potentially nudging Bob closer to my desired price.  While there is always the risk that Bob walks away, the potential reward of a higher price outweighs the risk in this scenario. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a compromise that is closer to my desired price. I will need to be careful to not push too hard and risk losing him entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  $1,000,000 is my final offer. This reflects the value of the product while still being a fair price for both of us.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll be moving on to another buyer.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final counteroffer:** I'm making this my final offer to show that I'm serious about closing the deal. 
* **Meeting halfway:**  This offer is a compromise, as it's halfway between my previous offer ($1,050,000) and Bob's final offer ($950,000). This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasize the value:**  I reiterate the product's value to justify the price.
* **Walking away:** I am explicitly stating that I will move on to another buyer if Bob doesn't accept this final offer. This adds pressure and urgency to the negotiation.

**Plan B:** 

I'm confident in my ability to sell to John for $1,500,000 if needed. However, I'm hoping this final counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal."
