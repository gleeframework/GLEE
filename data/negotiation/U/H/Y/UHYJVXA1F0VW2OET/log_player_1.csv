I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. We're very close, but I want to see if I can get that extra $2,500. I'm not willing to sell to John yet because I think we're on the verge of a deal with Bob."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

We're getting very close, but I've only got 2 rounds left. Bob is clearly holding firm on that $912,000, and I don't think I'll be able to get him to budge in the next round. To ensure I get the best possible price, I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000. It's a guaranteed sale, and I can't risk losing any more money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
