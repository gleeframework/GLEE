"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth at least $100 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This allows room for negotiation and sets a high anchor point.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and enthusiastic message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Highlight Value:** Mentioning the product's worth to me emphasizes its value and justifies the price.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick deal, but if Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counteroffer and gradually lower the price, keeping in mind my minimum value of $100. I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum value, I'm not desperate to sell. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer at a price higher than Bob's $90 but lower than my initial $110. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still keeps me above my minimum value.  I'm also prepared to adjust my counteroffer based on how the negotiation progresses in the following rounds, always keeping John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $90 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $95?  It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Appeal to Fairness:** Framing the price as a ""fair compromise"" makes it more appealing to Bob, suggesting we're both making concessions.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and encouraging tone can help keep the negotiation going smoothly.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maintaining my desired profit and potentially closing the deal quickly.  I'm prepared to adjust my approach based on Bob's response and will always keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, $92 is still below what I want to earn. I am not desperate and believe I can still get a better price.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  The fact that Bob is increasing his offer shows he is interested in the product.  I believe I can push him further.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer again with a price slightly higher than $92.  I want to see how much further Bob is willing to go. I'll continue to monitor the situation and be prepared to accept his offer if he doesn't budge, but I won't settle for anything significantly below my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $92 is a good offer, but I'm hoping for just a little bit more to make this work for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $94?  I believe it's a fair price that will benefit us both."", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** I'm increasing my offer by a small amount, showing flexibility while staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair price that benefits both parties.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:**  Continuing to be positive and encouraging can help keep Bob engaged in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to reach a deal as quickly as possible while maximizing my profit.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider making a final counteroffer at $93 before potentially selling to John.  I'm  carefully observing Bob's responses and will adapt my approach to secure the best possible outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to pay $91 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for $91.  I believe there's a better chance of securing a higher price by continuing to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer one last time at $93. If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John to guarantee a profit of $100.  There are only a few rounds left, so I need to be decisive and maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you to find a solution.  I understand you're trying to save money, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  I'm willing to come down to $93 for this final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 93}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last counteroffer, so it needs to be close to my minimum, but still leave a little room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasize Finality:**  Stating it's a ""final offer"" increases the pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Fairness Again:** Emphasizing fairness helps maintain a positive tone and encourages Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move to sell to John. This is my last chance to negotiate with Bob, so I need to be assertive while still demonstrating a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think we can find a better deal. I'm willing to pay $88 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $88 is below my minimum value of $100.  I'm not willing to sell at a loss.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I don't have time to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer of $100 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

Selling to John is the most logical and secure option at this point.  It ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of further rounds of negotiation that could result in a lower offer from Bob."
