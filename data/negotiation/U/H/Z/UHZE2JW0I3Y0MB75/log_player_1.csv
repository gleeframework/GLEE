{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer gives me a good profit, but also leaves some room for negotiation with Bob. It's possible he'll accept it outright, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $100, but that's my final offer. It's still a great price for a quality product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested, but I think $90 is a fair price for this product. Can you meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is closer to my desired price, it's still below what I consider fair.  I'll make one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more.  If he still refuses, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're keen on this product, but $92 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $96. If you're serious about this, this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 96}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $96. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $90 is a better price. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've made several counteroffers, and Bob has remained firm at $90. While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that we're unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price. To avoid wasting more time and ensure a sale, I'll accept John's offer of $120."
