"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm confident you'll be interested in making a serious offer. My initial price for the product is $11,500. What are your thoughts?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value you placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get closer to my perceived value. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to compromise, but I can only go up to $10,750.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $10,900. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $10,900 is still a bit above my limit. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,750.  This feels like a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not quite comfortable with $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $10,950. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time.",10950.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close to the end of our negotiations, and I'm still eager to reach a deal.  However, $10,950 is still beyond my budget.  To make this work, I'm willing to offer $10,800. This is my final offer. I believe it's fair to both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",10800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a deal, Bob, but I'm still not getting close enough to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get to $11,000. I'm thinking of $10,900. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one last time.",10900.0,Alice,9,
