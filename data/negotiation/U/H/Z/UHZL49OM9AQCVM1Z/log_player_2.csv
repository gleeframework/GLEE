"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to present it to me.  While I do see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell it to you for $875000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a much better deal than John's offer of $1,000,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price is too high. Accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sound decision at this point."
