"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $125 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?  I think that's a fair compromise.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $127 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference at $128.50. It's the best I can do, but I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.",128.5,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $128.50 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,8,
