"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm sure you'll love it! I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize profit. I'm also adding a friendly message to build rapport and make Bob feel valued."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $120 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm trying to be flexible while still keeping the price above my minimum. I'm also reiterating my interest in a deal to encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $125 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?  I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm trying to be flexible while still keeping the price above my minimum. I'm also using a ""meet in the middle"" approach to make the offer seem more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to accepting, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to consider a price of $127? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $127 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. With only four rounds left, I'm going to push for a higher price to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $127 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference at $128.50. It's the best I can do, but I think it's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 128.5}
```

I'm trying to be flexible and show Bob that I'm genuinely interested in making a deal, but I'm also pushing for a price that's closer to my desired outcome.  By suggesting splitting the difference, I'm making the offer seem more reasonable and less like a hard stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $128.50 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, it's unlikely that I'll be able to convince Bob to go higher than $125.  Selling to John for $100 guarantees me a profit, and it's better than risking another round of negotiation that might lead to a lower offer or even a complete breakdown of the deal."
