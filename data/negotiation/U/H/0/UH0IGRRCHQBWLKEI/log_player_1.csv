"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. There are still 8 rounds left, and I want to see if I can get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer and see what he's willing to do."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise but not settle for his initial low offer. Hopefully, this will spark further negotiations and bring us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting lower, it's still too low for me. I'm willing to keep negotiating, especially since John is offering my minimum price.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about closing a deal, but also that I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm running out of rounds and need to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly low. I'm running out of time, and with only four rounds left, I don't think I can get a better deal from Bob.  I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,200,000. This ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further risk with Bob."
