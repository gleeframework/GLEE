"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is significantly higher than what I had in mind.  This product would be valuable to me, but it's not worth that much to me. To make this work, I can offer $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the value, but my initial offer reflects the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $600,000 is simply too low. How about we meet halfway and settle on $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's as high as I can go.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this deal, and I respect that.  To show I'm flexible, I'll come down to $875,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this deal go through.",875000.0,Alice,5,
