Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is significantly higher than what I had in mind.  This product would be valuable to me, but it's not worth that much to me. To make this work, I can offer $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

This is too far below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate up but stay open to John's offer if needed."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the value, but my initial offer reflects the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $600,000 is simply too low. How about we meet halfway and settle on $950,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is moving in the right direction, but I'm still better off aiming for a higher price, even at the risk of losing him as a buyer. I'll counter, but I need to be mindful of pushing him away."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this deal, and I respect that.  To show I'm flexible, I'll come down to $875,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this deal go through."",
