"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly significant.  I could come down to $1,350,000. I believe that's a fair offer reflecting what the product brings to the table. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and allows for a smooth transaction.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
