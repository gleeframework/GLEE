"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a bit worried that I might be leaving money on the table if we don't meet at my target price. I'm willing to go up to $1080000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
