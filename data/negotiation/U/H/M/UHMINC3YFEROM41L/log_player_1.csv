Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, knowing that I can always sell to John for $120 if Bob rejects. This gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $110 is better than nothing, I'm still closer to my desired price of $120. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering $115, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $108 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer one last time before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
```

I'm offering $112, which is still above my minimum price but closer to Bob's latest offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to close the deal. If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum price, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome.  I'll sell to John to ensure I get my minimum desired price of $120."
