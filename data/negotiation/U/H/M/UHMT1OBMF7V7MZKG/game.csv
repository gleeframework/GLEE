"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $65 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground!",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm flexible. How about we try $85? That's a good midpoint, and it ensures we both get a fair deal. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're getting closer! I could do $78, how does that sound?",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  We're getting closer! How about we split the difference and go with $81?  It's only a few dollars away from your last offer, and it's a good compromise. What do you say?",81.0,Alice,7,
