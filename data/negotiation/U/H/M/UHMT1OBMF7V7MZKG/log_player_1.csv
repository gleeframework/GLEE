"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to build rapport with Bob. I also highlight the potential value of the product to him. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a good deal:**  Starting high gives me more negotiating power.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** His response will reveal how much he's willing to pay. 
* **Leave room for counteroffers:**  If Bob rejects my initial offer, I can still negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($100). While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, it's crucial to hold out for a better price. Selling to John at $100 would be a better option if we can't reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to find a price point that is closer to my minimum acceptable value while still being within a range that Bob might be willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $65 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm lowering my price from $110 to $90, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging further negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the potential for a compromise.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting Bob's low offer, I'm showing him that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Signal willingness to negotiate:**  Lowering my price shows good faith and encourages Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Keep the deal alive:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiations going, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $75 is a step closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $100 I can get from John.  I'm not in a hurry to sell and can afford to hold out for a better price, especially since we're only in round 4 of 10.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground between my minimum acceptable value and his offer. I'll focus on emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and highlighting the potential for a win-win scenario."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm flexible. How about we try $85? That's a good midpoint, and it ensures we both get a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm increasing my offer from $90 to $85, showing a willingness to compromise. This is a good midpoint between my last offer and Bob's current offer.
* **Message:** I'm highlighting the fairness of the price and emphasizing a win-win scenario for both of us.

This strategy aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  Increasing my offer shows that I'm serious about closing a deal.
* **Create a sense of urgency:**  By suggesting a ""good midpoint"", I'm subtly implying that this might be my final offer.
* **Set a clear target:** This counteroffer gives Bob a specific price to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're getting closer! I could do $78, how does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $78 is a slight increase from his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm still confident I can get a better price, and I'm not eager to settle for less.  Selling to John for $100 remains a better option than accepting Bob's current offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value while remaining open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  We're getting closer! How about we split the difference and go with $81?  It's only a few dollars away from your last offer, and it's a good compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 81}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $81, which is exactly in the middle of my last offer of $85 and Bob's latest offer of $78. This shows a willingness to compromise while staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the ""split the difference"" aspect of the offer, making it sound like a fair and reasonable compromise.  I also highlight the small difference between my offer and his last one to encourage acceptance. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Create a sense of finality:**  By suggesting a ""split the difference"" solution, I'm implying that this could be my final offer.
* **Increase pressure on Bob:** This tactic subtly puts the pressure on Bob to accept, as he's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain my leverage:**  I'm not settling for a price below my minimum, but I'm also showing flexibility to close the deal."
