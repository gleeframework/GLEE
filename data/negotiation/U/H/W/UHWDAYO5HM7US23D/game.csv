"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,000? This still leaves plenty of value for you, and it's closer to what I need.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 just isn't enough for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great value for you.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Let's try $10,600.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",10600.0,Bob,6,
