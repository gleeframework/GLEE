"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit lower than my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value of the product to me. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
