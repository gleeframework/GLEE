"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you. I believe this price reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice at $1,150,000 saves Bob $50,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her, it's still within Bob's budget and a better deal than John's price."
