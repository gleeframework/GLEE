"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a good profit.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds. It's better to secure a sale now rather than risk losing out completely."
