# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but you can likely get a better price. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate lower before resorting to John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $8500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9250?  I think that's fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down a bit, but I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm going to counter with another offer closer to my initial proposal."
