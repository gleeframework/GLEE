Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significant, and $8,000 is quite a bit below what I can consider. Could you do $12,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer on the price.  $12,000 is still a bit steep for my budget, but I'm willing to move up to $9,000.  That's a fair offer, considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum of $10,000 quickly. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price without further negotiation."
