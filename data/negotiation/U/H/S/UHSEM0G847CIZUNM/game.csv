"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $8,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're open to negotiation.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective.  While I understand your position, $8,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $18,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents a fair compromise and allows us to both reach an agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to find a middle ground here, but the reality is this product is quite valuable.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair.",16000.0,Alice,5,
