"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is far beyond my budget of $8,000. It's a good starting point to negotiate, so I will reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $8,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective.  While I understand your position, $8,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $18,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $18,000 is still significantly higher than my budget of $8,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and counter again, hoping to reach a price closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents a fair compromise and allows us to both reach an agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to find a middle ground here, but the reality is this product is quite valuable.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still too high for my budget. Although I'm willing to negotiate, I've reached a point where I'm not comfortable going any higher.  It's better for me to secure the product from John for $8,000 and avoid further rounds of negotiation.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and saves me the time and effort of potentially going back and forth with Alice."
