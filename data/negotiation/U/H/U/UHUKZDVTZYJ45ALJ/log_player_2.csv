Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is $1,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a significant reduction, but still within a reasonable range.  Bob is aiming to find a price point where both parties can agree, but he wants to secure a good deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is close to Bob's maximum budget, he still has a few rounds left to negotiate.  There's still a chance that Alice may be willing to lower her price further, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to compromise. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7900} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is again increasing his offer, but only by a small amount. This shows that he is serious about buying the product and is willing to compromise.  However, he is still trying to stay below his maximum budget of $8,000.  This offer is a good balance between showing willingness to compromise and pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has finally offered the product for $8,000, which is exactly Bob's maximum budget.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there is a risk that Alice might reject his next offer or even increase her price. Accepting this offer guarantees that Bob buys the product within his budget and avoids the risk of a higher price or losing the deal entirely."
