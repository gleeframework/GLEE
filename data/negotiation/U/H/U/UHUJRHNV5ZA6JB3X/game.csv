"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,800,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can meet my asking price.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,800,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for profit, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it allows me to stay within my budget and you to make a substantial profit.  Let's finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,400,000 is still not enough for me to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,700,000. This is a fair price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
