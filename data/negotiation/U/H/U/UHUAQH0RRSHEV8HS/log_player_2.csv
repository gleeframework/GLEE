"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her value for the product ($1,200,000 vs. $800,000). As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives me the opportunity to potentially negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, given its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, and it's still significantly higher than her value for the product. While I want to reach an agreement, I'm not willing to pay that much. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can close the gap."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than my preferred price, but it's closer to my counteroffer of $950,000.  It's also significantly lower than buying from John for $1,500,000.  It's a good compromise that allows me to get the product for a price that's within my budget, while also letting Alice make a profit.  Therefore, I will accept the offer."
