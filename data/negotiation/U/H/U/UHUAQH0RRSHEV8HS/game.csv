"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, given its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
