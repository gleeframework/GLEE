Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. 
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 (to John).
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000. Any price within this range could be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming for the higher end of the ZOPA is wise. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects its worth in the market. This is a limited-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable and desirable.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Time Pressure:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to decide quickly.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $1,350,000) to allow room to move up.
* **Relationship Value:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important beyond this deal, you might consider a slightly more moderate price.
