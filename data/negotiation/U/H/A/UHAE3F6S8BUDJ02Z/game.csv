"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I wouldn't part with it for anything less than $2,300,000. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to  $1,000,000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, my valuation for this product is based on its unique value proposition.  While I want to find a fair deal, I can't accept anything below $2,000,000. This is a significant reduction on my initial offer, and I believe it reflects my willingness to negotiate.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that this product has unique value, but the price needs to work for me too.  Would you consider $1,250,000? I feel that's a fair offer, splitting the difference between our previous offers.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,750,000? This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair price that acknowledges the value it brings.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close to what I can do. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me. My final offer is $1,400,000. If that works, I'm ready to close the deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're a tough negotiator! I admire that.  I'm willing to come down slightly one last time.  How about $1,450,000?  This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
