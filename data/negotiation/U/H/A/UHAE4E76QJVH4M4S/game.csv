"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $12,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is still quite a ways off from what I'm looking for.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still above what I can comfortably spend.  Let's split the difference and go with $14,000. That would be a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
