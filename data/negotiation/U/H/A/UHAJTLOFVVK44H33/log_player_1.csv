"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price, and I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product.  I'm also wary of selling to John at this point, as I'm hoping for a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of the product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I have several reasons for rejecting his offer:

* **Negotiating for a better price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially secure a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Time is on my side:**  I have several rounds left and I can continue to explore if Bob is truly serious about the product. 
* **John's offer:**  Although John's offer of $1,000,000 is a safe bet, I'm hoping to maximize my profit by striking a deal with Bob for a higher amount. 

I'm going to counteroffer with a slightly lower price, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to work with you, but $950,000 is still too low.  Let's try $1,000,000.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product and your own potential gains.  I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
