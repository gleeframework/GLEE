"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of the product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to work with you, but $950,000 is still too low.  Let's try $1,000,000.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product and your own potential gains.  I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
