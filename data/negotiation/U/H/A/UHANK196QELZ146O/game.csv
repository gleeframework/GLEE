"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? It's a fair compromise and gives us both a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I still need to get at least $1,000,000 for this product.  How about we settle at $1,000,000?  That's my absolute bottom line, and it's still a good deal for you.  Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
