Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price might result in a quicker sale and still generate a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), giving room for negotiation while staying above my minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Positive Framing:** Highlighting a ""special price"" aims to make Bob feel he's getting a unique opportunity. 

This strategy prioritizes getting a good price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
