"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I value your interest, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which still reflects the product's value and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 is still below what I can reasonably accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to consider other options, including buying from John for $800,000.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
