"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I can match this price again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""That's a bit steep for me, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. How about $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate the discount, Alice, but I'm still a bit away from my budget.  Could you do $95? I'm serious about buying if you're close to that."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110? This is my final compromise, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $110. While you could continue negotiating, it's getting risky. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $100 from John, saving you at least $10. It's better to take the sure thing at this point."
