"I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your transparency, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, as I mentioned earlier, but I'm also open to a slight compromise. I'll counteroffer at $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
