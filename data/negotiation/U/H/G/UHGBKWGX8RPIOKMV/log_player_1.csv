Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, there's an opportunity to earn more from Bob.
* **Strong Starting Point:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) leaves room for negotiation if he tries to haggle.
* **Alternative Buyer as Leverage:** Mentioning ""public listing"" subtly implies you have other options, making your offer seem time-sensitive.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is willing to pay a premium for exclusivity or early access. If you know he's extremely price-sensitive, you might adjust your approach.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You can always decrease your price slightly from $12,000 while still remaining above your minimum."
