"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to be competitive with John's offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $725,000. This is the minimum I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'm offering it to you for $675,000. This is the best I can do.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference between her offer and John's is getting smaller. Accepting the $675,000 offer secures a significant saving compared to John's price."
