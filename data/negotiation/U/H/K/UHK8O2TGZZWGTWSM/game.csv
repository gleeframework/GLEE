"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the potential benefits it brings. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we cannot accept $900,000 as it is still below our minimum acceptable price. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at $1,050,000. We believe this price is still a good compromise considering the value it brings to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $950,000, which is a significant step towards your offer and shows my serious interest in this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,025,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm firm on my offer of $975,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your need to sell. I'm confident we can find a solution that satisfies both of our needs.",975000.0,Bob,6,
