Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 16000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value is even higher than the asking price by mentioning ""unique value"" and listing it ""publicly."" This aims to nudge Bob towards accepting.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest. If he outright rejects $16,000, you can significantly lower the price knowing his upper limit is likely closer to $8,000. 
 
**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, the goal is to maximize profit. Don't be afraid to negotiate with Bob, but always keep your $12,000 fallback option in mind."
