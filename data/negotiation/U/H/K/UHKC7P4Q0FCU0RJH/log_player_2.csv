"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer of $140 is too high, exceeding Bob's maximum budget of $100. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with his maximum budget of $100. This is a strong opening counteroffer, showing Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but won't go above his limit.  It's important to be polite but firm in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $140 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a step closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob is better off continuing to try and get a lower price. He can always go to John if he doesn't get the price he wants from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $130 is still a bit too much for me. How about $110? That's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving money but is showing flexibility by increasing his offer. $110 is a reasonable compromise that's still within his budget, and it shows Alice that he's willing to negotiate.  The message highlights the benefits for both parties, increasing the chance of Alice accepting the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $110, which is $120. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  While there's a chance Bob could negotiate further, it's getting close to the end of the rounds, and the risk of not getting a satisfactory deal is increasing. Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his desired price.  It's a wise decision to take advantage of the reliable alternative while minimizing the risk of not securing the product at all."
