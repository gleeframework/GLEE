"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is my best price, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950000. I'd be willing to pay $920000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. I'm counteroffering at $940000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm surprised you're willing to go as high as $960000, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product.",980000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer, Bob. I'm still confident that the product is worth $980000. I'm not going to budge from that price. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",980000.0,Alice,9,
