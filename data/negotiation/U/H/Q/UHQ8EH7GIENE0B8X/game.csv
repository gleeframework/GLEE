"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $60.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is far too low.  It's clear we're both passionate about this product, so let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $120.  What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we split the difference closer to $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $105?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
