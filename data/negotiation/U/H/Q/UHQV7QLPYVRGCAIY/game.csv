"Alice, your offer is very generous, but unfortunately it's outside my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1000000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value this product at significantly more, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference. My counteroffer is $1750000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while considering your limitations.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1250000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting anywhere.  $1250000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but only one more time. My final counteroffer is $1500000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1500000 is still beyond my budget.  My final offer is $1250000. If we can't agree on this, I'm happy to go with another seller who's offering a more agreeable price.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
