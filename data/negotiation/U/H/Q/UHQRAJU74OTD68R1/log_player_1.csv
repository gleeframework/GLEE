Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product for $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects its significant worth."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your minimum price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000. Offering it at $1,300,000 leaves a potential profit margin for him while still securing a significant amount for you. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** There's always the risk Bob will reject the offer and counter significantly lower. However, this initial offer aims to gauge his willingness to pay closer to his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only commit to a maximum of $1,200,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, we still have room to negotiate. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to pay a significant amount, suggesting there's potential to settle closer to our initial price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. Would you consider $1,275,000?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between our last offer ($1,300,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,200,000). It shows a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Testing Bob's Limit:** This offer aims to gauge how much further Bob is willing to go.  It's a balance between securing a good deal and potentially pushing him away. 
* **Maintaining Distance from John's Offer:** We're still significantly above John's $1,000,000 offer, allowing room for further negotiation with Bob if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see that you're standing firm on your valuation, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  $1,250,000 is a very good offer. It's significantly above our minimum ($1,000,000) and only slightly below our last counteroffer. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might only yield small increments. The risk of Bob walking away increases with each counteroffer.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty and potential delays of further negotiation. 
 
While we could try to squeeze a bit more from Bob, accepting $1,250,000 represents a strong and secure profit."
