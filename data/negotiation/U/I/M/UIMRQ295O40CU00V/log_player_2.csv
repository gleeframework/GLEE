{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'll try to get it for a price closer to that.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  I believe this price reflects both our needs.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $600,000 and $800,000, which would be $700,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a significant compromise. This is my final offer before I explore other options.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise.  $775,000 is still not a price that works for me. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum. If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to make a counteroffer that is even closer to my target price. Since Alice is already at her minimum of $800,000, I'll try to make a small adjustment.
