Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $9,500 is a strong starting point, it leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly.
* **Secure the Higher Sale:** Offering a price significantly lower might raise suspicion or undervalue the product. This price point aims to secure the deal with Bob, who is willing to pay more than my backup offer from John."
