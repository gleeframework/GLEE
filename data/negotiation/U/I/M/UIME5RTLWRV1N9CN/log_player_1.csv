Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $120 as possible, my guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** Offering $119 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob wants to haggle, but still secures almost the maximum profit.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going straight for $120 might make Bob feel like he's not getting any kind of deal, potentially pushing him away. 
 
This strategy aims to balance getting the best price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
