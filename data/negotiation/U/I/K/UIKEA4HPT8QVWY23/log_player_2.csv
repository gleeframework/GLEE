Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we say $135? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the product's quality and value.

Alice is getting very close to our ideal price.  One more counter offer should help us determine if we can get a better deal than John's offer."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $125, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth a bit more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession - how about we say $130? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $130.  It's better to buy from John for $120 and save the extra $10."
