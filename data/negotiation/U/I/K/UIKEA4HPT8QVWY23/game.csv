"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. While I like it, $180 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $140. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120?  That would be a fair deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we say $135? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the product's quality and value.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to go up slightly to $125, but that's my absolute limit.",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $125, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth a bit more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession - how about we say $130? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",130.0,Alice,7,
