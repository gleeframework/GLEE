Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,400,000. I believe it presents significant value for your needs, and this offer reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price of $1,400,000 sets a high anchor point. While it's below your guaranteed sale price to John, it's significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves space for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you the opportunity to potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Justification for Value:**  The message emphasizes finding a ""mutually beneficial agreement"" and suggests the price reflects the product's value, hoping to nudge Bob closer to accepting the high price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** This strategy assumes Bob is somewhat risk-averse. If he's willing to walk away from the deal easily, a lower initial offer might be necessary.
* **Time Constraints:** If there's a time pressure to sell, you might need to adjust your strategy to be more aggressive."
