"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While I'm interested in the product, I'm aiming to save as much as possible. To that end, I'd like to propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that considers your needs and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $925,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're still looking to save some money, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $925,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $975,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",975000.0,Alice,5,
