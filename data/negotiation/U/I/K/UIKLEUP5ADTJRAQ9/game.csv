"I've already met you halfway, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll sell it to you for $95, but that's my final offer.",95.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'll make one last offer: $85. If you can meet me at that price, I'll buy the product from you.",85.0,Bob,10,
