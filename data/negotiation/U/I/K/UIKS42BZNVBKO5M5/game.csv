,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $140 is still a bit too high for me. Could you do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate that offer, but I'm afraid $110 is still pushing my budget.  I could meet you at $80, but I couldn't go any higher.",80.0,Bob,6,
