Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think it would be a great deal for you!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 
 
Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120, there's a chance to earn an extra $19 from Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  The $119 price point is still a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $100, making it likely he'll perceive it as a fair deal if he's interested in the product at all.
* **Alternative Option:** By having John as a backup buyer, you're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
