"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900000 is a good start, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1100000 to make this work for me.  Let's try $1050000.  It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1050000 is a bit too high for me. How about $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $950000 isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $1000000, but I need to get closer to my minimum.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great deal considering the value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
