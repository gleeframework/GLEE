"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the value is at least $10,000. Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Since Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000, there's room for a deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference. I'll come down to $10,500. This is still a great price for you, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above Bob's maximum price point. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if Alice is willing to come down further.  Bob can still get the product for less from John, so there's no immediate urgency to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's finalize this deal, and both of us can walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10000}
