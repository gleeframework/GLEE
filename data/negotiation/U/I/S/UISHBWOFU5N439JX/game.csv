"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $875,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $800,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $875,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",850000.0,Alice,5,
