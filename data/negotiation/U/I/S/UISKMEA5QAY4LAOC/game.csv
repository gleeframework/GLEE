"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $7,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $8,500 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  This is my final offer, and it reflects the maximum I can pay.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,250. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $8,750. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8750.0,Alice,5,
