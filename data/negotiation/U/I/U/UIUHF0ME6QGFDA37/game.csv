"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm offering it to you for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it. What do you say?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $100 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it for $137.50.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll still get great value for your money.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $137.50 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $110 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll sell it to you for $120. That's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. How about $115? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close the deal.",115.0,Bob,6,
