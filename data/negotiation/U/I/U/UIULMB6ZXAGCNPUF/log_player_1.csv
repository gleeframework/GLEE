"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with a price higher than your absolute bottom line. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential price ceiling. 
* **Confident Positioning:** By framing the product's value positively and expressing confidence in the offer, you aim to influence Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly invites Bob's feedback and indicates a willingness to negotiate, demonstrating flexibility while keeping your reserve price confidential."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). You have room to negotiate and try to bring him closer to your target. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is your safety net, but it's too early to use it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this discussion.  While I understand your perspective on the market value, the value of this product goes beyond typical market comparisons. It possesses unique qualities that I believe will significantly benefit you.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I feel this reflects the true value while acknowledging your initial offer."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but Holding Firm:** You're acknowledging Bob's offer and perspective, showing you're listening, but you're not drastically lowering your price. 
* **Justifying the Value:** You're reiterating the unique value proposition, subtly reminding Bob why his ""market value"" assessment might not fully apply.
* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down $300,000 is a significant move, designed to signal willingness to negotiate but also to gauge Bob's reaction. A smaller concession at this point might incentivize him to hold firm at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could potentially push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
