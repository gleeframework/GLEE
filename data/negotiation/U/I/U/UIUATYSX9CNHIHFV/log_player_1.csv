"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to budge.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my price downwards in subsequent rounds, while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price. I have 9 rounds left to close the deal and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than $9,500. I hope this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still far from what I'm hoping for. I'll continue to counteroffer, hoping to find a middle ground before I have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still staying above his last offer. I'm hoping to find a compromise in the next few rounds before I have to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I've lowered my price significantly, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating. I have four rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to settle for a price that's still below my ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm making a final push to reach a compromise with Bob. This offer is a bit closer to his last offer, but still reflects my belief that the product is worth more than $9,500. I'm hoping he'll see the value in closing the deal at this price. If he rejects, I will have to seriously consider selling to John, as I only have three rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of not selling at all.  I've lowered my price significantly, but Bob still seems unwilling to meet me halfway.  With only two rounds left, I'm concerned I might not be able to reach a satisfactory price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
