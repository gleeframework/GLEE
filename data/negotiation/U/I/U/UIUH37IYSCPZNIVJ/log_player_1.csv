"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but still secures a significant profit for me. I'm confident he'll counteroffer, giving me an opportunity to refine the price while staying above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise while maintaining a comfortable profit margin. I expect Bob to accept or offer a counter-proposal closer to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can achieve a better deal. I will continue negotiating with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm again lowering my offer, but this time by a smaller margin. This shows continued flexibility, but I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to accept, or at least make a counteroffer close to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is now above my minimum threshold of $800,000.  This is a good deal, and I'm happy to accept it.  It's important to be practical and recognize when a reasonable offer is presented.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether."
