"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  However, $15,000 is quite high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $8,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer, it establishes a starting point for negotiation. It leaves room to increase the offer while still staying well below your $10,000 maximum.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:**  This counter-offer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. Her response will give you valuable information for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $11,000 is still above your budget and what John offers. There's a chance to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down, Alice.  I appreciate the compromise. To be completely honest, my budget caps out at $10,000.  Would you be willing to meet that price?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Transparent:** You've now revealed your maximum budget to Alice. This shows you're serious but also limits your flexibility to go higher.
* **Putting the Ball in Alice's Court:** By firmly stating your budget and offering your maximum, you're putting the pressure on Alice to decide if she's willing to sell at that price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, you always have the option to go with John's offer of $10,000 if Alice refuses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'll meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has declared this her final offer, and it's above your maximum budget. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a standing offer from John for $10,000, which meets your needs perfectly.
* **No More Room to Negotiate:**  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better price from Alice.

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and take advantage of the guaranteed good deal from John."
