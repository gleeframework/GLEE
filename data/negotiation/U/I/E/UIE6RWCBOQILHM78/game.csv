"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  However, $15,000 is quite high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down, Alice.  I appreciate the compromise. To be completely honest, my budget caps out at $10,000.  Would you be willing to meet that price?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'll meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
