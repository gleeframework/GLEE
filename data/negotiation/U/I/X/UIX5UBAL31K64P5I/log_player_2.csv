"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```tool_code

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```tool_code
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
```

Reasoning: 

* **Starting Low:**  I'm aiming to pay significantly less than my $150 maximum. Starting with a low counteroffer gives me room to negotiate upwards if needed. 
* **Respectful but Firm:**  My message acknowledges Alice's offer but clearly states my position. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is slightly above Alice's value ($120) but well below her initial asking price. It gives her room to counter while potentially securing a great deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great price for a product worth $150 to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```tool_code
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning:

* **Good Deal:** $125 is a solid price, saving me $25 off my maximum and $25 off John's offer. 
* **Alice is Motivated:** Her counteroffer suggests she's willing to negotiate to make a sale. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I might be able to push for a slightly lower price, the potential savings are small compared to the risk of Alice walking away or the certainty of John's higher price."
