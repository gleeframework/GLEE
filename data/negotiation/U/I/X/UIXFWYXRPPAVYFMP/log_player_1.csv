"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price above my minimum. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to compromise later if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is close to my minimum, I'm going to hold out for a slightly higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering a price that's still above my minimum but closer to his offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,500 is tempting, I'm going to hold out for another round to see if I can get closer to my target price. I still have time to negotiate before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still holding out for a higher price. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but also that I value my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, and Bob's offer barely exceeding my minimum, it's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  I'm guaranteed a higher price with John, and further negotiation with Bob might not yield a better result within the remaining rounds."
