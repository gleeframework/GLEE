"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love.

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1350000. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1275000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
