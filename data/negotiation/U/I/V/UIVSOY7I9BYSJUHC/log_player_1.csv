Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, it's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for potential negotiation and maximizes your potential profit. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies there's competition (""interest I've already received"") to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Leaving Room:**  The $15,000 price tag is negotiable. If Bob outright rejects it, you can always lower the price slightly to see if you can still secure a deal above your minimum. 

**Important:** This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit. It assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the initial offer."
