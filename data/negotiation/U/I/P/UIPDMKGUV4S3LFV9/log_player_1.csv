Round 2
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,300,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a compromise on my side, and I believe it's a fair price considering our negotiations so far. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.

```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has consistently demonstrated he's unwilling or unable to meet a price point that's even remotely close to your minimum.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer. Accepting John's offer ensures you receive your desired minimum price and avoids further time wasted on a potentially fruitless negotiation."
