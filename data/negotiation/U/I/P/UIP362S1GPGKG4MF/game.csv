"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  I think $900,000 is a bit high.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counter-offer, but there's still a gap between us. I can go up to $750,000.  I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're still a bit apart, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  My absolute best offer is $775,000. If you can't do that, I understand, but I might have to explore other options.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll sell the product to you for $800,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,7,
