Alice's offer:

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's good that she's come down, I'm still not ready to go over $800,000. It's time to make another counteroffer."

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm not willing to go over my budget, and it sounds like she's serious about having another buyer.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer."
