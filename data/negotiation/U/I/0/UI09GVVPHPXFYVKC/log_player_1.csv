Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

This offer leaves room for negotiation while still securing a price significantly higher than my minimum. I'm confident Bob will be interested in this deal, as it's still $1000 less than his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm happy to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for less than $13,000 at this point.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm raising the price slightly from my previous offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price, but also that I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's still a better outcome than selling to John.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
