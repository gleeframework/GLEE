"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation. This will give me a strong starting point and hopefully encourage Bob to counteroffer instead of immediately rejecting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a significant profit, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point. This counteroffer keeps the negotiations moving forward while still giving me a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get a little closer to my ideal price, it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to budge much further.  $1,250,000 is still a good profit, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely.  It's time to secure the sale."
