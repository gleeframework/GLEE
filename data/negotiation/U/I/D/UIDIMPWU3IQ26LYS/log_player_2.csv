# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $6,500. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $6,000. What do you think?

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, Bob. I'm willing to go slightly higher, but I think $6,200 is a more reasonable price for this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point, and while I could push further, it's getting close to the point where the potential savings aren't worth the risk of losing the deal altogether. $6,200 is a reasonable compromise."
