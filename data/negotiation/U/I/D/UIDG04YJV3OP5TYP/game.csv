"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price given the value I place on the product, and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget and my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really eager to get this product and believe that $975,000 is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.  This offer is closer to my budget, and it would still allow you to make a good profit.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
