Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, and I understand you're looking for a fair deal. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and  $1,400,000 undervalues its potential.  To move things forward, I can offer it to you for $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but the product truly is exceptional and  $1,600,000 doesn't reflect its value. To be candid, I have another potential buyer ready at a higher price. However, I believe in being fair and offering you this opportunity first.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000 as my final offer. This is a substantial discount from my initial proposal and a fair price considering the product's potential.
