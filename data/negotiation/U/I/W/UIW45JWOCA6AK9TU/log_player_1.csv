"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also prepared to lower my price in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $18,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to try and negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm offering $19,000 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still gives me a profit beyond what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to my desired price.  I'm accepting his offer of $18,500 as it's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
