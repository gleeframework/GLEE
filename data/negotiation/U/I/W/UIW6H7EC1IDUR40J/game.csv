"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth a significant amount. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is higher. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $8,500? That's still a good price for you, considering its value to you. Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd be willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
