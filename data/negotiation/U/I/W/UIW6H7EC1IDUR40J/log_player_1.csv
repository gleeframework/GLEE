Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:

I will sell the product to John for $8,000. Bob's offer is my minimum price, but I don't want to continue negotiating with him. It's a sure deal with John, and I'm not willing to risk losing the sale by continuing the negotiation."
