"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $180. I'm willing to pay that price for the product.",180.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $190. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this amazing product.",190.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $190 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $175. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",175.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your persistence, Bob! I understand that $175 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $185. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",185.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm afraid $185 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $175. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price, and I'd rather buy the product from John for $150.",175.0,Bob,6,
