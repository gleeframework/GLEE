# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.

Bob should reject the offer. $175 is way over his budget. He can either counter-offer or buy from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $140. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a discounted rate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $140 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  Bob should reject and try to get the price down further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While $130 is closer to his budget, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  Since he's already had a few rounds of negotiation and it seems like Alice isn't willing to go lower, it's best for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John."
