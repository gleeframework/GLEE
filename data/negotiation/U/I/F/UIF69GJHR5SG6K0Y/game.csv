"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $140. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a discounted rate. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $140, but I'm still a bit over my budget. How about $120? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
