"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. We appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly below its true worth. We're willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000.  We believe this is a fair compromise and reflects the value the product brings.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're trying to find common ground here. While we appreciate you moving towards our price, the value of this product is undeniable.  We're willing to accept $1,075,000. This is our final offer, as we believe it's a fair reflection of what we both bring to the table.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to find common ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think $1,050,000 is my absolute maximum. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again and find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
