Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with an offer higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,100,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without explicitly revealing your bottom line.

**Goal:**  The aim is to secure a price as close to $1,200,000 as possible. If Bob accepts the $1,100,000, it's a significant profit. If he negotiates, you have room to maneuver while still staying above your guaranteed sale price."
