While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he still has 5 rounds left and can potentially get a better deal. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as he can always opt to buy from John if he doesn't get a satisfactory price from Alice."

Bob is down to his last round and Alice's offer is still higher than his ideal price. Given that Alice's last counter-offer shows she's unlikely to go lower, Bob should buy from John and guarantee a price within his budget."
