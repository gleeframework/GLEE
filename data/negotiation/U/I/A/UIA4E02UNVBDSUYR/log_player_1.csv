"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the value Bob sees in the product.  This sets a strong starting point for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will likely counteroffer, giving us room to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my desired range. I'm not ready to settle yet, and I believe I can push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm dropping the price slightly from my initial offer, acknowledging Bob's counteroffer, but still maintaining a price point that's significantly higher than my minimum. This shows flexibility while demonstrating I'm confident in the product's value. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to settle. I believe I can push for a higher price by continuing the negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000, hoping to meet Bob halfway. This shows I'm willing to be flexible and reach an agreement, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  The remaining rounds will be crucial to see if we can reach a deal or if I need to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This offer from Bob is close enough to my desired range and the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially ending up with a lower price from John is too high.  I'll accept this offer and secure a good sale."
