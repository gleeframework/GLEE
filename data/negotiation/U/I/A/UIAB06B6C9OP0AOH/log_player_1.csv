"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My asking price is $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum of $100.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $90 for it. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you consider $95? It's a great deal, and we can close this quickly!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm aiming for a compromise by meeting Bob halfway.  $95 is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this counter-offer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am still not able to meet at $95, but I am willing to pay $90. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has stuck to his $90 offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  While I'd like to close the deal, my minimum price is $100.  Selling to John guarantees me that amount, so it's the best option at this point."
