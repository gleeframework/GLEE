**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer is below John's standing offer. It's clear Bob is unlikely to move significantly higher. While a deal with Bob might still be possible, it carries the risk of ending up even lower than John's offer if negotiations continue to stall.  Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price."
