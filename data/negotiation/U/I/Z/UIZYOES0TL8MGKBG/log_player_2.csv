"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's above the product's worth to you ($1,500,000) and leaves little room for negotiation. It's better to reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value and my budget, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if she's willing to compromise.
* **Fairness:**  The offer is below the product's worth to me ($1,500,000), and above Alice's minimum value ($1,000,000), suggesting a fair starting point.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This offer leaves room for Alice to counter if she wants to, but it sets a clear expectation that I'm not willing to pay her asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value the product holds for me. My counteroffer is $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. While she's shown willingness to negotiate, $1,250,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  I need to continue negotiating to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, and I'm willing to pay a fair amount. But $1,250,000 is still out of my range. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,150,000? It's a compromise that gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer splits the difference between my previous offer ($1,050,000) and Alice's latest offer ($1,250,000). It shows a willingness to meet her halfway, but still keeps the price below my maximum budget.
* **Staying Firm:** It's important to hold firm on my budget, so I'm not going higher than $1,150,000 at this point. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm reiterating the concept of a fair price, making it clear that I'm looking for a mutually beneficial outcome."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This counteroffer is my final offer, indicating that I'm serious about making a deal.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're still aiming for a higher price, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. To be honest, I'm running out of time and I'm starting to get concerned about the deal falling through. If we can't agree on a price within the next few rounds, I may have to consider other options. My final counteroffer is $1,190,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the limited time and my potential need to consider other options. This adds pressure on Alice to close the deal.
* **Small concession:** I'm only raising my offer by a small amount ($10,000) to show good faith but maintain my position.
* **Final offer:**  I'm reiterating that this is my final offer to make it clear that I'm not going higher.

This approach combines pressure with a small concession, making it likely Alice will either accept or make a counteroffer closer to my target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get close to your target, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. However, I'm simply not able to go higher than $1,190,000. It's my absolute final offer.  If we can't close the deal at this price, I'll have to move forward with another seller.  Let's make this work."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
