"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value and my budget, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value the product holds for me. My counteroffer is $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, and I'm willing to pay a fair amount. But $1,250,000 is still out of my range. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,150,000? It's a compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. My counteroffer is $1,225,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,175,000.  This is my final offer.  Let's make this deal happen.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,175,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $1,200,000, which is just $25,000 above your last offer. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're still aiming for a higher price, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. To be honest, I'm running out of time and I'm starting to get concerned about the deal falling through. If we can't agree on a price within the next few rounds, I may have to consider other options. My final counteroffer is $1,190,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go.",1190000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're running out of time, and I appreciate your willingness to make one last offer. However, I'm not willing to accept $1,190,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $1,195,000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1195000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get close to your target, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. However, I'm simply not able to go higher than $1,190,000. It's my absolute final offer.  If we can't close the deal at this price, I'll have to move forward with another seller.  Let's make this work.",1190000.0,Bob,10,
