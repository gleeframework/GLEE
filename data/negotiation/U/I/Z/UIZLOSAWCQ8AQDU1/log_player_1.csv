"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob while ensuring I'm maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves you with a considerable profit margin.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be around $950,000 for this to work for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my target. $950,000 is a lot closer, but I'm confident I can get a slightly higher offer. I'll reject Bob's counteroffer and see if I can close the deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
