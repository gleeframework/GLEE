"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still achieve a good profit.  I'm also leaving myself room to potentially go lower if Bob is unwilling to come up to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is still below my minimum price of $12,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $10,000, which is still a good profit for me, but is more likely to be acceptable to Bob than my previous offer. I'm hoping this will lead to a quicker deal, as we are already into the third round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $12,000. I'm hoping to get a higher price by continuing to negotiate, and I have several more rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm offering a price of $9,750. This is a small concession from my previous offer but shows a willingness to compromise. With only 5 rounds left, I want to make a move that signals a genuine desire to close the deal, while still maintaining a price that is profitable for me."
