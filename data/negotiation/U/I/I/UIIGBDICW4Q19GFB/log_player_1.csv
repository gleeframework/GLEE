Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $1,500,000?**  This is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I am hoping to maximize my profit by starting high and potentially negotiating down. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk that Bob will reject this offer. However, the potential reward of a higher price makes it worthwhile.
* **Negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent offers. This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially extract a higher price."
