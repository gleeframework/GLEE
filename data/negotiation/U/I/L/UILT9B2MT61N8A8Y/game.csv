"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this. $1,800,000 is a significant step, but the value this product brings to the table is undeniable. How about we meet halfway at $2,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",2050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the value of the product, but I still think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but not quite that high. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. What if we settle on $1,975,000? That's a significant move on my end, and it reflects my desire to see this deal through.",1975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I still think $1,900,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but not quite that high. How about $1,925,000?",1925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but I need to see a bit more movement to make this work.  Time is also a factor as I have other interested parties. How about we land on $1,950,000? This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair reflection of the value you're receiving.",1950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you have other interested parties, but I'm still not convinced that $1,950,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,935,000?",1935000.0,Bob,8,
