"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for this product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I can offer you a compromise at $900,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? That's a significant investment on my part, but I believe the product's value justifies it.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,5,
