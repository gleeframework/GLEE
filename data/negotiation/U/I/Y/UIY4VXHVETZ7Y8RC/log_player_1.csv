Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it will be worth at least $1,000,000 to you. To make this a swift and mutually beneficial transaction, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, and you have a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This gives you strong leverage to aim high.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,800,000) sets an anchor. While Bob is likely to negotiate, this starting point may lead to a final price higher than if you started lower.
* **Justification:**  The message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high. This allows Bob to potentially justify it in his own mind (perceived scarcity, unique value, etc.).

**Important Note:**  This strategy is aggressive. There's a chance Bob will reject the offer outright. However, the potential for a much higher profit makes it a calculated risk worth taking, especially with your fallback option of selling to John."
