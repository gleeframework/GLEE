Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $150. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully earn more than my minimum. I'll be prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum, I want to try and get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's a price he'll be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is higher than what John is offering, and is a good compromise. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiations."
