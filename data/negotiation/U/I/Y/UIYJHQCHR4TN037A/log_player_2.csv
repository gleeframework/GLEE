The product is worth no more than $800,000 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also sets a clear expectation that I'm not willing to pay her asking price."

I'm offering Alice my maximum price. This is a clear signal that I'm serious about buying the product at this price, but I won't go any higher. If she rejects this offer, I'm ready to buy from John."
