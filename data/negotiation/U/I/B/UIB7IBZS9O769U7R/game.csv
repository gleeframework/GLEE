"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $1,600,000 to make this work for me.  This price still offers significant value for you.  Let's find a middle ground, how about we split the difference?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit off from where I need to be. To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $1,450,000.  That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. To make this work for me, I need to be at $1,400,000. That's only $50,000 away from your offer and we're getting very close to a deal.  Let's be realistic, we both want this to happen, so let's find that middle ground.",1400000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,350,000 to $1,400,000, so how about $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Bob,8,
