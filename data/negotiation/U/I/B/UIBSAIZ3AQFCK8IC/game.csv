"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 undervalues its potential. I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
