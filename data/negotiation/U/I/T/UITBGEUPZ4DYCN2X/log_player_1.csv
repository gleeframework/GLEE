Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a little high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that still recognizes the product's unique value.  It's a significant investment, but I believe you'll see a strong return on it."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

It's getting late in the negotiation, and while I'd prefer a higher price, $1,050,000 is a good deal.  It's significantly more than John's offer and within a reasonable range of my desired price.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
