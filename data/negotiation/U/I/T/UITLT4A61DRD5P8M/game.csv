"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,150,000. This is my best compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product at this price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $1,180,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally agree on a price.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your need to get closer to your target, but $1,180,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000.  This is a fair price that's closer to your desired value, and it allows us to reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,125,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $1,200,000 is too high, but I can offer you $1,160,000. This is the last time I can go up, and I'm hoping we can finally agree on a price.",1160000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,160,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,140,000.  This is a good compromise that gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1140000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get as close to my target as possible. I can offer you a price of $1,155,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally agree on a price.",1155000.0,Alice,9,
