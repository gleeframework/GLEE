Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1800000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'd be willing to offer $1000000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
