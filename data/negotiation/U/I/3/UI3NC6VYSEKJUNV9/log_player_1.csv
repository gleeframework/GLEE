{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  This is a great deal for you, as it's well below its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation.  It's lower than my minimum value but leaves room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value and accept, but I'm also prepared to counteroffer if needed.  If the negotiation drags on or Bob becomes difficult, I have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, so I need to counteroffer.  I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, he'll realize I'm serious about my minimum price and be willing to come up a bit."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $11,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value to me, and I'm sure we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price.  While $10,750 is closer than his previous offer, I'm going to stick with my minimum price.  There's still a decent gap between his offer and my minimum, and I'm confident I can get a higher price, even if it means negotiating for a bit longer.  I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if this deal falls through."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $10,750 is still well below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,250 for this.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,900. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,900 is still below my minimum price, and we've been going back and forth for a while.  I'm starting to get frustrated with the negotiation, and I don't want to waste more time.  John is a guaranteed buyer at a price that's much closer to my minimum.  I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John."
