Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for a potentially lucrative negotiation. It's important to remember that my goal is to maximize my profit, and this high starting point gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  It's also possible Bob might be willing to pay a premium for the product, in which case I've positioned myself to benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is a substantial amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price. It's possible that Bob is willing to go higher, and I can leverage my knowledge of John's offer to push for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows flexibility while still maintaining a price point that's closer to my desired outcome.  I believe this offer is reasonable, and it increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer of $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially losing a sale altogether. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum threshold and eliminates any uncertainty."
