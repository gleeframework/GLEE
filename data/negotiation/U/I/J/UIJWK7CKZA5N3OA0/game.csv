"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,500 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  I'm glad we're getting closer. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
