"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional product.  I'm confident it will be highly valuable to you. My initial offer is $2000000. Let's discuss further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product sounds promising, but $2000000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1200000 for it,  which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1750000, given the unique value of this product.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is a special product, but $1750000 is still out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value we've discussed. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1400000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price reflecting the value of this unique product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1600000 is closer to what I can afford, but I'm still hoping to get a bit lower.  I'm willing to offer $1500000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
