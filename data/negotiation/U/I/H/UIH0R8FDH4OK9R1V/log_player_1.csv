"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to try and get closer to my desired price of $95.  There are still 8 rounds remaining, so I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $88. That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $88 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is a good offer, I still believe I can get a bit closer to $90.  I'm only on round 4 of 10, so there's still room for negotiation.  I'll try to compromise a bit more, but I'm not willing to go below $88 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $86.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 86.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $80. I'm willing to meet you at $84. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd like to get closer to $90, we're down to the wire.  With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. $84 is still a decent profit and  I'd rather secure the sale than risk getting stuck with the lower offer from John."
