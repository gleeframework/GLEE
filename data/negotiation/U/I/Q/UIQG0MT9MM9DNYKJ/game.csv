"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 was a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $95. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. How about we meet in the middle again at $100? It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
