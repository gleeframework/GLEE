"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you in the middle at $135. Would you be interested in buying the product at that price?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, Alice. How about $115? That's a fair compromise.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $115. I can do $130, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $120, but that's my absolute limit.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob! However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $120, as it's below my minimum price. I can offer you a slight premium at $125, but that's as low as I can go.",125.0,Alice,7,
