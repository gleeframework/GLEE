"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it for $135. This is a great deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $135. This saves you $15 compared to buying from John.
* **Even though Alice values the product at $120, it's still a good deal for you.** You're getting the product at a price lower than your perceived value."
