"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice.  $750,000 is a good start, but there's likely room for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within a specific budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer, but there's still room for improvement. It's worth seeing if we can get her down a bit more before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $725,000 is closer to my target, but I'm still hoping to land at $710,000.  This product is truly valuable to me, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 710000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $710,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $720,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly, and at $720,000, the price is within a range that's worth it to me.  It's better than going to John and paying $800,000."
