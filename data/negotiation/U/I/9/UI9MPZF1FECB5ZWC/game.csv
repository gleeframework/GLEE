"Alice,  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within a specific budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. ",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $725,000 is closer to my target, but I'm still hoping to land at $710,000.  This product is truly valuable to me, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",710000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $710,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $720,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.
