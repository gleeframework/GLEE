(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is your maximum, there's no reason to assume Alice won't be willing to negotiate lower.  By rejecting the offer, you open the door for a potential better price without risking anything."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount (20% off) is a common tactic in negotiation. This shows Alice you're serious about buying the product but are looking for a good deal. It's unlikely she'll accept this immediately, but it sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue pushing for a lower price. I'm still confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still below her offer, demonstrating my commitment to getting a good deal. This approach helps maintain momentum in the negotiation without becoming overly aggressive."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,200 is getting closer to my maximum, I believe I can still do better. I'm confident that I can get Alice to come down a bit further. By rejecting her offer, I maintain the pressure and keep the negotiation going."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer by a smaller amount this time, signaling to Alice that I'm getting closer to my limit. I'm also trying to find a middle ground between our previous offers. This strategy aims to create a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $150 above my last counteroffer.  While I could keep negotiating, the potential savings are getting smaller. Considering I have only 3 rounds left, it's a good time to accept.  I've saved $900 compared to John's price, which is a good result."
