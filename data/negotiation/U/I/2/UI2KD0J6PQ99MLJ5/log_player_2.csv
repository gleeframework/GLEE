"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above what the product is worth to Bob.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is considerably below its value. I could consider a price of $1,000,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above Bob's maximum value.  He should reject and continue negotiating to try and get a price closer to his budget."
