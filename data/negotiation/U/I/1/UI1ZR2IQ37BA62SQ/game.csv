"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",18000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,15000.0
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product at this price.",16000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. ",14000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, so I'm offering it to you for $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let me know!",16000.0,Alice,5,,
