I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $80, but still leaves some room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still a fair price considering the value of the product to him."
