You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is a better price than John's $100, you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially save even more money."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $90 is a better deal than John's offer of $100, and it's also better than your last offer of $85. Accepting this offer saves you $10 compared to John. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject and you'd end up paying $100 to John."
