You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that is closer to his maximum budget of $10,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  This counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a price lower than John's offer. Therefore, Bob chooses to buy the product from John for $10,000 to secure the best possible price."
