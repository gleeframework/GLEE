"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John.  There's room to bargain between $130 and our $150 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That price is a little high for me. Could you do $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with an offer significantly lower than Alice's opening price. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the likelihood of getting a price closer to Alice's minimum ($120) while staying well below our $150 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $130 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice came down to $125, which is a fair compromise. It's a good deal for us, saving $25 off John's price and leaving Alice with some profit. Accepting now avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
