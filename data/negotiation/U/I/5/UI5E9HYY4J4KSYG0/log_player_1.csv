Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $19,000 allows room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The 24-hour limit might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer before you move on to John.
* **Value Highlighting:**  The message emphasizes potential benefits for Bob, subtly justifying the higher price. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters or expresses hesitation. Your goal is to find the highest price Bob is willing to pay while still exceeding your $15,000 baseline."
