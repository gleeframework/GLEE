"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  A $1,150,000 offer still allows for a significant profit for me while leaving room for Bob to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **Strategic Play:** It's important to start aggressively and see if Bob is willing to meet my initial price. If not, we can enter a negotiation that's likely to be beneficial to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value for Me:** While Bob's offer is still a decent profit, I can likely do better. I know the product is worth more to him, and I have 8 rounds remaining. 
* **Building Negotiation Momentum:** Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate for a quick sale. This builds momentum for a more favorable price in future rounds. 
* **Strategic Risk:** Selling to John now would be a guaranteed $1,000,000, but I'm taking a calculated risk that I can secure a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1120000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** My counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer, but still retains a significant profit for me. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:** By offering $1,120,000, I'm aiming for a price that is more attractive to Bob than his last offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Pressure:** We have fewer rounds left, so I'm aiming to find a price that Bob will accept before I need to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can secure a better deal. He's clearly willing to negotiate, and I have more rounds to work with.
* **Avoiding the ""Too Low"" Trap:** Accepting this offer would be a quick profit, but it might lead to regrets later if I could have gotten more. 
* **Building Leverage:** By continuing the negotiation, I'm keeping the pressure on Bob. He might be more inclined to come closer to my desired price if he sees that I'm not desperate.
* **Sell to John as a Last Resort:** I'm keeping John as a safety net, but I'm not ready to sell to him yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm getting closer to Bob's last offer, but still maintaining a significant profit margin. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while staying within my desired range.
* **Pressure Tactics:** With fewer rounds remaining, the pressure is increasing on Bob. This counteroffer shows I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm not going to settle for anything significantly below my desired price.
* **Anticipating Acceptance:** Bob's previous offers suggest he's willing to pay more than $1,060,000. This counteroffer might be attractive enough for him to finally agree.
* **Keeping John in the Background:** The possibility of selling to John remains a safety net, but I'm confident I can secure a better price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I know the product is worth more to him, and I have a few rounds left.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John now would secure a guaranteed $1,000,000, but I'm taking a calculated risk that I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.  
* **Negotiation Momentum:** Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate and that I'm confident I can get a better deal.  This keeps the pressure on Bob.

I'm still confident I can secure a better price with Bob, but I'm also mindful of the dwindling rounds.  I'll need to be more strategic in my next counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm making a significant concession this round, moving down to $1,075,000.  This shows a willingness to meet Bob halfway while still maintaining a profit.
* **Final Push:** This is likely my last serious counteroffer. If Bob rejects it, I'll either accept his next offer or sell to John, as the rounds are getting very limited.
* **Strategic Risk:**  This is a calculated risk.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm left with only three rounds, so I'll need to be prepared to accept his next offer or sell to John.
* **Anticipating Acceptance:** I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer. It's a good price for him, and it's a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're down to two rounds, and Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my desired price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Selling to John would be a guaranteed $1,000,000. I need to decide if I want to gamble on getting more from Bob or secure the known profit.
* **Potential for a Counter-Counteroffer:**  I'm still hoping Bob will come up with a better offer in the next round, but I need to be prepared to counter again if needed. 
* **Strategic Risk:**  This is a risky move, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm not going to sell at a low price unless I have to.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob doesn't increase his offer in the next round, I'll likely sell to John to secure my minimum profit. However, I'm still willing to make a counteroffer, but it will likely be very close to his last offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1040000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making one last counteroffer, moving closer to Bob's offer but leaving some room for negotiation. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're down to the final round. If this offer is rejected, I'll be forced to either accept Bob's next offer or sell to John.
* **Calculated Risk:** I'm taking a chance that Bob will see this as a fair compromise, given the dwindling rounds. However, I'm prepared to sell to John if necessary.
* **Minimizing Loss:** While this offer is lower than my preferred price, it's still a significant profit compared to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round:** This is the last round of negotiation, and Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is my minimum target. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and trying to negotiate further risks getting nothing at all. There is no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer again, and it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely.

**Conclusion:** 

While I would have preferred a higher price,  selling to John is the most sensible decision in this final round.  It secures a profit, which is my primary goal."
