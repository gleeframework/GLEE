"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering its value. Let's close this deal!",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $1,325,000? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,325,000 is getting closer, but I still need to secure a price that reflects the product's value. How about we settle on $1,375,000?  This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal quickly.  What do you say?",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the product's value, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we try $1,325,000 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you reconsider?",1325000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm running out of time, and I really want to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're running out of time, Alice, but I'm not willing to stretch my budget further. I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'll make one more attempt to find a middle ground. How about we try $1,320,000? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",1320000.0,Bob,8,
