"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a middle ground.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $108.  That's a good price for both of us, and I'm sure we can make this work.",108.0,Bob,4,
