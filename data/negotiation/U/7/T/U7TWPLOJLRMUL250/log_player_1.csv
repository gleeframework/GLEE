{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value but still leaves me with a profit. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm focusing on the benefits for Bob and using positive language to create a good first impression.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This offer allows for some wiggle room for counteroffers. 

This is a strategic opening offer that balances the need to maximize profits with the desire to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $5,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $5,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000 and far below the value the product holds for me.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it signals that he is interested. I can use this to my advantage in the next round.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss. By rejecting, I maintain my leverage and can potentially secure a more favorable deal. 

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $5,000 is simply too low for me. It wouldn't be a fair deal considering the value it offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This price reflects the benefits you'll gain while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  Instead of rejecting outright, I'm proposing a compromise by offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's.
* **Highlighting value:**  I reiterate the value the product offers to Bob to justify the price.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm still holding firm to a price that is significantly higher than his initial offer.

This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but also emphasizes my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still working within a tight budget. Could we settle on $7,000? That would be a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $7,000 is closer to my desired value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity to improve the deal:**  I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain my leverage and potentially push for a higher price.

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer and believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, aiming to reach a compromise that is more favorable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,000. However, I'm still not quite there.  Considering the significant value this product will bring to your business, I'm willing to lower my price to $8,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a smaller reduction:** I'm reducing my offer by only $500, signaling that I'm serious about reaching a deal but not willing to drop much further.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** I highlight the value to Bob's business and frame the offer as a ""win-win"" to encourage him to accept.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to close the gap. If he accepts, I get a good price. If he rejects, I can decide whether to keep negotiating or sell to John."
