"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $5,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $5,000 is simply too low for me. It wouldn't be a fair deal considering the value it offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This price reflects the benefits you'll gain while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still working within a tight budget. Could we settle on $7,000? That would be a win-win for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,000. However, I'm still not quite there.  Considering the significant value this product will bring to your business, I'm willing to lower my price to $8,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
