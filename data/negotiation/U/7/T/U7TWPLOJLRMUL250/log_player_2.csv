"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $5,000 is simply too low for me. It wouldn't be a fair deal considering the value it offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This price reflects the benefits you'll gain while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.
