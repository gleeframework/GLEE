{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is high enough to give me a good profit, but also leaves room for negotiation.  It's a strong starting point, but I'm prepared to counter if Bob rejects it.  If he does, I'll keep John in mind as a backup buyer to ensure I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer.  I believe I can get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.  I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer while still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1,350,000? This price reflects the value of the product while still being attractive to you. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
