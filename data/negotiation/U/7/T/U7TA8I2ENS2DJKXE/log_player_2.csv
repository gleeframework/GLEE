"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $13,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is less than John's price, it's still above Bob's ideal price range.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is a good compromise. He's offering $11,000, which is $2,000 less than Alice's offer. This should hopefully open up the negotiation and make Alice more willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a good price for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price range, he's still aiming to save even more. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price. He might try to meet Alice halfway again, or propose something slightly lower than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $11,500?  That's closer to what I can afford, and it's a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise. He's suggesting a price that's right in the middle of their previous offers, which could lead to a faster agreement."
