"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in your product. However, while I acknowledge its potential, $1250000 is slightly higher than my budget allows. I'd be happy to consider a price of $1000000, which reflects a fair value for both of us. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your counteroffer, I would like to suggest a compromise.

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1125000 is closer, it's still above my budget. Let's try to bridge the gap further. I'm willing to offer $1050000. This price is still within the range of value for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both parties.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
