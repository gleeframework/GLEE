"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget. Offering $8,500 is a significant drop from Alice's offer and demonstrates Bob's seriousness in getting a good deal. This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation while staying within Bob's desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Even though it's lower than the initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's also worth noting that Alice has rejected Bob's counteroffer, showing a potential willingness to compromise.  There's still room for Bob to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it under his maximum budget. This shows Alice that he is willing to negotiate but also sets a firm limit. The counteroffer of $8,750 allows for a small margin for Alice to agree while remaining beneficial for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Even though Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, there's still room for Bob to push for a better price. There are still a few rounds left, and Bob should continue trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8850}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again increasing his counteroffer slightly, inching closer to Alice's last offer. This shows a commitment to reaching a deal but also maintains a firm stance.  $8,850 is still within Bob's budget and potentially a good compromise point for both parties.  With fewer rounds left, this offer might encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,100 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. With only a few rounds left, the negotiation process is likely to continue with small increments.  Bob has already made a significant effort to negotiate a lower price but Alice's counteroffers are still too high.  It's becoming clear that reaching a deal within Bob's desired range is unlikely.  

At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice, who might not be willing to compromise further."
