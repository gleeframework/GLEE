"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair price that takes into account your concerns while still reflecting the product's true value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1400000. I think this is a more reasonable price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise further if necessary.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1520000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.",1520000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to make one more counteroffer, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1300000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
