Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I'm open to discussing further, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15,000 is higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a very fair offer, considering the quality and benefits you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $13,500 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my needs and its value to me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a substantial difference from my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while hopefully working within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer, $11,750 is still above his budget. It's worth seeing if he can get Alice to come down further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I am too!  While $11,750 is closer, I'm still just outside my budget. My final offer is $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me while respecting your needs. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 10500}
