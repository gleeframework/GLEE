"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is less than your $12,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower since the product is only worth $8,000 to her. By rejecting her initial offer, you might be able to secure a better deal."
