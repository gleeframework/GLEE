Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $12,000 for the product. This is my absolute top price, as I've found another seller willing to offer it to me for this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
