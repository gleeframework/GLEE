"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I believe it's a very fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. He has room to counteroffer and potentially save even more money.  Buying from John at $150 is the least desirable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $125. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive:**  $130 is within Bob's budget and a significant discount from John's price.
* **Negotiating further may not be worthwhile:**  While Bob could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk Alice will walk away.  
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing negotiations takes time and effort.  

At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible choice to secure the product at a good price."
