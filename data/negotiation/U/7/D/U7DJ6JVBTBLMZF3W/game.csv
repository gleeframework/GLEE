"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,750,000 for you. This is a more reasonable compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product holds value, but $1,750,000 is still too steep for me. I could meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This offer represents a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
