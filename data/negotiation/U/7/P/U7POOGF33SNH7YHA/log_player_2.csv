"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,500 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so he's offering a price that's slightly above that, hoping to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price.  While $14,000 is a slight improvement over John's offer, Bob wants to continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target price.  He still has a chance to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate but remaining firm in his desire to keep the price below $13,500. This counteroffer is still within Alice's acceptable range, as she values the product at $12,000.  He's hoping this offer will be enough to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,500 is getting closer to Bob's upper limit, but it's still higher than his ideal price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, he's running the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffers and potentially asking for an even higher price. 

At this point, buying from John for $15,000 offers a clear and known price. Bob is guaranteed the product without risking further negotiation with Alice.  He's already saved $500 compared to John's initial price, and further negotiation might not yield a substantial enough savings to justify the risk."
