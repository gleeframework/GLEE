"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially pricing it at $16,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",16000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe the product is valuable, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $16,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I'm confident in the $16,000 value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet at $14,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
