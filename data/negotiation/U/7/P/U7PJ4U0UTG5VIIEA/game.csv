"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. To make this work for me, I'd need to bring the price down to $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
