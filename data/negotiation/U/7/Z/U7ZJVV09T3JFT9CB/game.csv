,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a great deal for both of us, let's make this happen! ",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $109. It's a fair price for both of us and we can finally close this deal.",109.0,Alice,5,
