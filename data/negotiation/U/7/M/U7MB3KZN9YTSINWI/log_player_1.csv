"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential savings for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, I can still try to negotiate a better price.  There are more rounds left and I'm not desperate to sell."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is a significant savings for you and still within my budget. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  I'm still closer to my goal of $1,500,000 by selling to John. With more rounds to go, I can likely squeeze out a better price from Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your latest offer, I'm still a bit tight on budget at $1,325,000. How about we settle at $1,310,000? This is a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,310,000.
