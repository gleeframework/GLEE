Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,325,000. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's close this deal.
