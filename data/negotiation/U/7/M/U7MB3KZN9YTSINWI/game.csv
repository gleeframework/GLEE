"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential savings for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a significant saving for you compared to my original asking price. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is a significant savings for you and still within my budget. Let's try to close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,325,000. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's close this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your latest offer, I'm still a bit tight on budget at $1,325,000. How about we settle at $1,310,000? This is a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. ",1310000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,310,000.  Let's meet at $1,315,000. This is a fair compromise and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?",1315000.0,Alice,7,
