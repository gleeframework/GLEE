``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what I need to get. I'm going to see if I can get him to come up a bit."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $95 is getting closer, it's still not enough for me. I'm going to see if I can get him to budge a bit more before I consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
