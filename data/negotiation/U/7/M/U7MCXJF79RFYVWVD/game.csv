"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1800000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

Let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
