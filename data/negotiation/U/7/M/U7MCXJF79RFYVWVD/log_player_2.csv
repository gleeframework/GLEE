Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm not willing to go that much over my budget. It's time to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

While Alice is getting closer to my price, $1,200,000 is still outside of my budget. I'll make one last counteroffer before moving on to John."
