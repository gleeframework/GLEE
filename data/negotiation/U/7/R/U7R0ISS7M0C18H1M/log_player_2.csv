"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's in my best interest to try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds to go, so I have time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your confidence in the product, but $1,000,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $850,000 just doesn't cover the value I've invested in this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and allows for a smooth transaction.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my target price, but still a bit high. I'd like to see if I can get closer to my $800,000 goal. There are still 7 rounds left, so I have time to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still above my budget.  How about we meet at $875,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and ensures a quick and easy transaction.  Let's work together to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding common ground. However, $875,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a price that allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm getting closer to my target price, but I want to see if I can get an even better deal.  I still have 5 rounds left, so I have time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try to meet at $880,000. This is a good compromise for both of us, and it would ensure a smooth transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 880000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a good price.  To be honest, $880,000 just isn't enough to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $895,000.  This is my final offer, and it reflects a considerable compromise on my part.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $895,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $895,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high, and we're down to the wire. With only three rounds left, I'm concerned I won't be able to negotiate further. I'm also worried that if I reject Alice's offer, she might counter with a price higher than $895,000.  It's better to secure the product now from John for $800,000 and avoid any further risk."
