"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is $800,000. I'm willing to make a generous offer to you, and I'm proposing a price of $750,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to sell it to you at this price today. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my target price. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price with her counteroffer of $725,000.  This is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it.  Buying from Alice for $725,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $800,000."
