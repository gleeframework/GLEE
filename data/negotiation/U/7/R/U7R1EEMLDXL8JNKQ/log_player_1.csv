Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate that Alice, but I'm on a tighter budget. Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to his actual value, it's unlikely he'll go above $80.  It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John."
