"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see how Bob reacts to this offer and whether he's willing to come close to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I can get $1,000,000 from John, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal than Bob's offer.  I believe this shows flexibility while maintaining a profitable price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I can get $1,000,000 from John, I'm still holding out for a better price from Bob. I'll continue negotiating with him, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm still not going to give away the product for a low price. This offer is still significantly higher than Bob's previous offer, but demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I can get $1,000,000 from John, I'm still holding out for a better price from Bob. I'm not sure how much more he is willing to pay, but I want to see if there is still room for negotiation.  I'll continue negotiating with him, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to make a final counteroffer at $1,000,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's the same price I can get from John.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
