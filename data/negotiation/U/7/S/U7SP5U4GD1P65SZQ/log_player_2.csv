# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. $9,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for less."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject the offer again. He is still trying to get the product for under $8,000 and Alice is only willing to go down to $8,750. He can get the product from John for $8,000, so it is still in his best interest to continue negotiating with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $8,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal.

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's final offer of $8,500 is still more than Bob wants to pay, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000. It's in Bob's best interest to take the cheaper option."
