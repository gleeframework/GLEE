""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $700,000?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a price of $820,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $790,000, which is closer to your target but still reflects the product's value. What do you think?

**Reasoning:** Alice is very slowly lowering her price. At this rate, it's unlikely she'll go down to a price that beats John's offer of $800,000 before you run out of rounds.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John now."
