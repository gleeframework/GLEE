"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a price of $820,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $820,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Could you meet me halfway and consider $760,000? That would work much better for my budget.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $790,000, which is closer to your target but still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,5,
