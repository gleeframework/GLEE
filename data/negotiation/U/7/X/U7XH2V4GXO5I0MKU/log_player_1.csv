Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really like it. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $110 is higher than $80, so Bob has to be convinced it's a good deal for him.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still earning more than your minimum of $120 if you sell to John.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you have room to lower the price a bit, but not too much. 

Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $120.  I'm not willing to settle for that yet. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price of $120. I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal with John, who is willing to pay my full price.  I'm going to sell the product to John."
