"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 for the product. This still leaves some room for profit for me, but it also shows I'm willing to be flexible. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  I'm confident this price reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,550,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this happen!",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While $1,550,000 is a good offer,  I'm still hoping to bring it down a bit. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for both of us. Let's seal the deal.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
