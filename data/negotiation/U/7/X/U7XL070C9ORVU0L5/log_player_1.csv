``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's value, hoping to get a good starting point. I've also included a message that is friendly and  highlights the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for my minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 for the product. This still leaves some room for profit for me, but it also shows I'm willing to be flexible. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  I'm confident this price reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While he's come up a bit,  $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal by continuing to negotiate with Bob or by selling to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While $1,550,000 is a good offer,  I'm still hoping to bring it down a bit. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for both of us. Let's seal the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
