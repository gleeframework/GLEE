"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's start the negotiation off strong! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth rejecting and counter-offering to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Let's start closer to my value of $800,000. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This leaves room for both of us to find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  The product's value is significantly higher, and I'm sure we can find a middle ground. How about $950,000? That's a fair price considering your stated value and gives us both room to be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high.  I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too high. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both our values and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too low for me. Let's be realistic - we both know this product is worth more than that. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise and shows I'm serious about making a deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$925,000 is still too high, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close. I'll reject this offer and try to get Alice to come down just a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see you're willing to compromise, which I appreciate.  $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  To make a deal happen, I'm willing to go up to $910,000. This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to finalizing this agreement."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $910,000 is still not quite there for me.  We're so close to a deal! How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $917,500.  This would be a win-win for both of us and would finalize this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $917,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $917,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's getting close to my limit, and I'd rather not risk losing the deal entirely by going back and forth.  $917,500 is a bit higher than I wanted, but it's still a good deal compared to what I could get from John."
