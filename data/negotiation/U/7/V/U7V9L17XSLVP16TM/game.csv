"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for this product. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $80 is way too low. This product is really valuable and I'm confident it's worth much more. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $100 for this product. Let's try to find a compromise.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about we split the difference between your offer and my last one? Would you be willing to pay $120?",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there with $120. I'm willing to pay $110. This is a good price for us both, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,6,
