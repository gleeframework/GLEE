"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Considering its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $950,000 is still too high, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  He has room to go lower, and even if he doesn't get his ideal price, he's still better off than buying from John."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $900,000 is closer to his target price, he can still try to negotiate further. He's already demonstrated a willingness to go lower, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.  He has room to push for a lower price, and even if he doesn't get his ideal price, he's still better off than buying from John."
