"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go down to $12,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,5,
