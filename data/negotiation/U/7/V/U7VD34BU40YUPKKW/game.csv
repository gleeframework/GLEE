"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a great deal for you, considering it's worth $8,000 to you. I'm confident this price is fair, but I'm open to negotiating further. Let me know your thoughts.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,500?  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? This would give you a good return on your investment, and it would allow me to stay within my budget. ",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $11,250, which is a fair compromise and allows me to make a decent profit. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,250 is still a bit above my budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This would allow us both to reach an agreement that's fair and reasonable.  Let me know your thoughts.",11000.0,Bob,6,
