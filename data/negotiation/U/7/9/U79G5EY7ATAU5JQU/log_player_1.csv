Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, but I also want to make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I'm aiming high, the $140 offer leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate.  
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $150 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum."
