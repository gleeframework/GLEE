# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. This exceptional item holds significant value to me, and I believe it would be a perfect fit for your needs and aspirations. Considering its worth to you, I propose a transaction price of $1,200,000. This amount reflects not only the intrinsic value of the product but also allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I look forward to discussing this further with you and exploring how we can make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of:

* **A counter-offer from Alice:** She might be willing to lower the price closer to your range.
* **Sticking with John:**  You have a guaranteed backup option at $800,000, ensuring you don't overpay."
