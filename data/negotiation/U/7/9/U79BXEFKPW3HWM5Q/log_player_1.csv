{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's potential value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest and make him more willing to negotiate.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The open-ended question encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay my desired price. Therefore, I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a good starting point, I need to ensure I get a fair value for it.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  Let's meet halfway!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Interest:** I'm showing Bob that I respect his interest, but I'm not willing to accept his low offer.
* **Fair Value:** I'm emphasizing that I need to ensure a fair return on the product, subtly reminding Bob that it's worth more than he's offering.
* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise by lowering my price by $500, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm using the phrase ""meet halfway"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and potentially make him more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is showing some flexibility, his offer is still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm still confident in the value of the product and don't want to settle for a low price.  I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John who is willing to pay my desired price, so I will continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,750 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,250.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $8,875? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still hopeful we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to drop my price to $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the closest I can come to your last offer. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but $9,000 is still a bit above my comfort level. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're running out of time, and Bob's offer is still well below my minimum. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob and losing valuable time is high. It's time to secure the guaranteed sale with John.  The guaranteed $12,000 from John is a much better outcome than risking a lower price or a failed negotiation."
