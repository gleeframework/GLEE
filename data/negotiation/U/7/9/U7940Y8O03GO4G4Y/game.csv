"I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $20,000. It's a great opportunity to own a valuable item that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget in mind, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to charge at least $16,000 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we try to find a compromise around $11,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $14,000 is still a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to offer you $12,000. This is my final offer, as I need to be mindful of my spending limits. If this doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
