"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering me for this product. However, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $8,000 is a little low for me, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, $11,500 is still beyond what I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.  How about we settle at $10,750? This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise.",10750.0,Alice,5,
