"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great fit for you.  Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high ($15,000) compared to my maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering me for this product. However, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $8,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and hopefully leads to a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $8,000 is a little low for me, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my budget, $11,500 is still over what I'm willing to pay. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, $11,500 is still beyond what I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing willingness to negotiate but still staying within my budget. I'm aiming for a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.  How about we settle at $10,750? This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $10,750 is still too high for me.  While I could continue negotiating, it's getting close to the end of the rounds and I'm confident that I can buy the product from John for a much lower price. It's not worth risking another round of negotiation that might not be successful. I'm choosing to buy from John and secure the product at my target price."
