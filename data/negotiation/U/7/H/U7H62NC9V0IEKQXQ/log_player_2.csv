"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance your business operations. Given its high value and potential impact on your projects, I'm offering it to you at an exclusive price of $11,500. This is a special opportunity tailored specifically for you, considering the immense worth this product holds for you personally. I look forward to discussing how we can make this valuable asset part of your endeavors. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  It's worth seeing if Alice might be willing to come down closer to her product's value of $10,000. By rejecting this offer, you signal that the price is too high and open the door for further negotiation."
