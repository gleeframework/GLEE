Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really like. I'm asking for $115 for it."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

Here's why this is a good starting point:

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start a negotiation slightly above your target price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that's favorable for you.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** Offering the product at $115 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate the price down slightly while still ensuring you get more than your minimum selling price.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This first offer will help you understand how eager Bob is to buy the product and how flexible he might be on price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is engaged:** Even though Bob rejected the initial offer, his counteroffer of $105 shows he's seriously interested. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still a $5 gap between Bob's offer and John's guaranteed price. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you coming back with a price. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** By countering at $110, we're signaling a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum. This approach often feels fair to both parties and can lead to a quicker agreement.
* **Maintaining a buffer:**  This counteroffer still keeps us $10 above our guaranteed sale price with John, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of a price around $108. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good profit margin:** Accepting $108 still yields a profit of $8 over the guaranteed sale to John.
* **Diminishing returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield a dollar or two more, and there's a risk of Bob walking away entirely.
* **Time value:**  Closing the deal now avoids further delays and allows you to move on."
