Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to negotiate, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $135, which is a good price considering your maximum budget is $150.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she might not budge, or the negotiations could drag on. Accepting her offer secures the product at a decent price."
