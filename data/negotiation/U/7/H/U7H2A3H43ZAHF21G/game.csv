"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this product is valuable, but I'm looking to make a more significant discount. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1050000. Can you consider this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to accept that price. The product's value is undeniable, and I believe a fair compromise would be $1075000.
