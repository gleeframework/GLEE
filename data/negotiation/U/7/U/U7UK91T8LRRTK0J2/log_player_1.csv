Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a good starting point:**  It's more than what the product is worth to Bob ($8,000), but still gives him some room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and encourages a response:**  It highlights the value of the product and makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 

By offering a price that's slightly below what John would pay, Alice has a good chance of striking a deal with Bob while still getting a profit. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can always sell to John and get her desired $12,000."
