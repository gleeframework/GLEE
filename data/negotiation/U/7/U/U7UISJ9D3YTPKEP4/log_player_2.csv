"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While $110 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what Alice is willing to accept.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He offers $95, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while also trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to Bob's desired price point, it's still more than what he's willing to pay right now. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a little high at $105. How about we split the difference and settle at $100? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate and try to get a better price. He proposes splitting the difference between his last offer and Alice's, showing he's willing to compromise while still trying to save money. This offer is also still within his budget, making it a reasonable proposition."
