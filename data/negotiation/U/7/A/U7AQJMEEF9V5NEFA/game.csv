"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value the product brings to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I think it's a great compromise.",11000.0,Alice,5,
