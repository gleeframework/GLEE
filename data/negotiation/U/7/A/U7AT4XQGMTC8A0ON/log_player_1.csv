Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your ""backup"" or reservation value.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving him a potential gain of $500,000 if he buys from you instead of finding an alternative.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,499,999 works for both of you. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept.  

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating its value to Bob, the message implies the product's worth with ""unique value proposition"" and ""exceed your expectations.""
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence can make the offer more persuasive.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You can gradually lower your price, but never go below your $1,000,000 safety net."
