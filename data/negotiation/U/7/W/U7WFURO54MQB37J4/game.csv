"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering both our interests, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe still represents a good deal for both of us. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this stage. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product. This price is fair and reflects the value we both see in this deal. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is a compromise that takes into account the value you place on the product, and I believe it's a price we can both live with. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
