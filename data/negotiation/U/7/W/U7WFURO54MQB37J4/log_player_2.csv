"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than John's offer, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  You have significant room to bargain since your maximum price is $1,500,000 and Alice's minimum price is $800,000."

This is a fair price considering both our interests, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe still represents a good deal for both of us. What are your thoughts on this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get the price down further, especially considering Alice's minimum selling price is $800,000. Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer will continue to test the boundaries of the negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this stage. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product. This price is fair and reflects the value we both see in this deal. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is a compromise that takes into account the value you place on the product, and I believe it's a price we can both live with. What are your thoughts on this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,025,000, which is very close to your last counteroffer of $1,000,000.  Further negotiation might yield a lower price, but it's unlikely you'll get it down to $1,000,000 or less.  Accepting this offer ensures a deal at a price that's within your budget and significantly better than buying from John."
