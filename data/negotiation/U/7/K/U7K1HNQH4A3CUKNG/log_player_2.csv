"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $7,500. This is a great compromise that still gives you a good deal on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $7,000, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $7,800. This is a good compromise that still gives you a great deal on the product, and I think it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $7,800. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation when you have a guaranteed option for $8,000 with John."
