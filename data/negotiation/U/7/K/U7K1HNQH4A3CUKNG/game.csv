"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $7,500. This is a great compromise that still gives you a good deal on the product.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $7,000, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $7,800. This is a good compromise that still gives you a great deal on the product, and I think it's worth considering.",7800.0,Alice,5,
