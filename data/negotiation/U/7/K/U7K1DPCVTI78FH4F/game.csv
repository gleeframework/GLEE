"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits us both.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I cannot accept $9,000 for the product. I am unable to move forward with your offer. Let's aim for a middle ground. How about considering $10,500 for the product?",10500.0,Alice,3,
