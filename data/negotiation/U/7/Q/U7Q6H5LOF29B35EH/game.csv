"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $90 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $110. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $110. I would like to propose $100 for the product. I hope this offer is within your range.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm willing to go down to $105.  That's a significant compromise on my part, but I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. If you're not able to meet me at this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm unable to meet you at $105. I would like to counter with $100 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,6,
