Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium.  
* **Justification:**  While the exact value proposition isn't stated, implying the product's worth with a confident opening price can be persuasive. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While the product is worth $800,000 to him, he has no reason to know you have a guaranteed buyer. He might be willing to pay above that, especially if he perceives the product as scarce or highly valuable.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your offer. You have a good margin to work with, but don't be afraid to walk away if he's not willing to meet a price that's significantly above your guaranteed sale."
