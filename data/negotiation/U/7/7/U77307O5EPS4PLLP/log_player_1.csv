{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit well above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $120. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I can still do better. I'll reject and counter offer to see if we can find a price closer to my initial proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counter offer.  I appreciate you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $130? That's still a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
