Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes the product as potentially very valuable. 
* **Justification for the price:** By mentioning that Bob will find it ""a worthwhile investment,"" Alice subtly implies the price is justified by the value Bob will receive. 
* **Open for negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding, and Alice explicitly asks for Bob's thoughts, signaling her willingness to negotiate. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market research:** While not provided in the prompt, knowing if there are other potential buyers besides John, and what they might pay, would influence Alice's strategy.
* **Bob's personality:** If Alice has any insight into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive, passive), she might adjust her approach.
* **Risk tolerance:** A higher offer has the potential for higher profit, but also increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer entirely."
