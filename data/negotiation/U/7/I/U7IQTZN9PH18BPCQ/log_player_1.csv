Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's something truly special that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $950,000, which is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially make a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, aiming to build a good relationship with Bob. 
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit he'll gain.

This approach balances my desire for a high price with the need to keep the negotiation open and avoid an immediate rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Even though Bob is interested, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can likely get a better price by counteroffering.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price allows for a fair compromise and ensures we both get a good outcome. Let's find a way to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial price. 
* **Value-based Argument:** I'm tying my counteroffer to the product's value for Bob, subtly reminding him of its potential benefits. 
* **Emphasis on Win-Win:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a way to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome, encouraging Bob to see it as a positive step towards a deal.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while still protecting my interests and potentially achieving a more favorable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Would you be open to meeting me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's offer:** Bob's offer is just $50,000 more than what John is willing to pay. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a risk that continuing to negotiate with Bob will result in a lower price or a prolonged negotiation process.
* **Guaranteeing profit:** Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit of $800,000, which meets my minimum acceptable price.

It's a wise move to secure a guaranteed profit with John, especially given that further negotiation with Bob might not yield a significantly better outcome and could potentially lead to losing the deal altogether."
