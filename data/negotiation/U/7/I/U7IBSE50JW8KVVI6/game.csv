"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, let's meet in the middle, how about $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I've done my research and I'm not willing to go above $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  $13,500 is still a bit low for what it offers. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, my final offer. This is a great deal for a product you won't regret.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16,000, but I'm still not convinced it's worth that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $13,500, so my final offer is $14,250. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",14250.0,Bob,6,
