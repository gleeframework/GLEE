Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, let's meet in the middle, how about $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I've done my research and I'm not willing to go above $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  $13,500 is still a bit low for what it offers. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, my final offer. This is a great deal for a product you won't regret."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16,000, but I'm still not convinced it's worth that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $13,500, so my final offer is $14,250. This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250

It's clear that Bob is very unlikely to go above $15,000.  While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk Bob will lowball even further. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk getting less with Bob."
