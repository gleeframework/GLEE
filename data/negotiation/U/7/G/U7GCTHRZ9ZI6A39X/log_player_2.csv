Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $155. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice has made it clear she's not willing to go much lower than $155. Since you have the option to buy from John for $150, it makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from John. You'll save $5 and avoid further potentially fruitless negotiation."
