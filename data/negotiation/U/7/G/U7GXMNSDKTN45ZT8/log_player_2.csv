{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  How about $80? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **I'm acknowledging Alice's effort to meet me halfway while still pushing for a lower price.**
* **$80 is a reasonable compromise, showing I'm flexible but not willing to overpay.**
* **This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and hopefully leads to a final agreement.**"
