"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good deal, he can potentially get it for even less.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a decent profit while still being a great deal for me."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This way, we can both benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is closer to Bob's goal, it's still higher than what John is offering.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. There's a good chance she'll come down even more, and Bob can save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while ensuring I get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,020,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible. While Alice has come down to $1,020,000, it's still higher than what John is offering.  Since Bob has the option to purchase from John at a lower price, it makes the most sense to go with the guaranteed deal and save an additional $20,000."
