``` 

At this point, it's better to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,330,000 is a significant profit margin over your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing negotiations might only yield small increments above Bob's current offer. The time and effort involved may not be worth the potential gain. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a higher offer from Bob risks him walking away entirely. Accepting now secures a very good deal."
