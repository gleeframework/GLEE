Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good price without risking a quick sale to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm countering with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $135 is a reasonable compromise and exceeds the price John is offering.  I'll accept this offer to secure a sale and avoid further negotiation."
