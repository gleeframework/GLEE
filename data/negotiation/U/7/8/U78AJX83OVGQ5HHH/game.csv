"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to me is at least $15000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within my maximum spending limit of $8000. I would like to make a counteroffer at this price point.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $8000. Considering the value I place on it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a new offer of $10000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $10000. Given my budget constraints, I am unable to go above $8000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects both our positions.",8000.0,Bob,4,
