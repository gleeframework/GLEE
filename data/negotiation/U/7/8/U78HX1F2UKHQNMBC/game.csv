"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think!",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is still a significant discount from the value I place on the product, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, but $1,200,000 is still too far from what I have in mind.  Could you consider something closer to $650,000? I believe that would be a fair deal.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering your stated value for it.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
