Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is still a significant discount from the value I place on the product, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, but $1,200,000 is still too far from what I have in mind.  Could you consider something closer to $650,000? I believe that would be a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 for the product.
