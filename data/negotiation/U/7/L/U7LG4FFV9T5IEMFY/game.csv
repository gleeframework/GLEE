"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's my firm limit, and I think it's a fair price considering everything.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's really my bottom line.  Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,5,
