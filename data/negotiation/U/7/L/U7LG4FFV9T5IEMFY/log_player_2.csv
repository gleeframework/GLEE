"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  I believe it's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is much higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to buy the product for much less than Alice's initial asking price. Starting with a low offer of $8,000 gives us room to negotiate upwards and still stay well below our $10,000 limit.
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a low number first, we're trying to influence Alice's perception of the product's value in the negotiation. 

Let's see how Alice responds to this counteroffer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial price. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is a significant improvement, it's still above our $10,000 limit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to come down in price suggests there's room for further negotiation to reach a price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's my firm limit, and I think it's a fair price considering everything."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're now offering our maximum price, making it clear that this is our limit. By stating it as a ""firm limit"" we're signaling that we're serious.
* **Justification:** We're providing a reason for our offer (""fair price considering everything"") without revealing too much about our alternative (John's offer).
* **Pressure:** By putting our final offer on the table, we're putting a bit of pressure on Alice to either accept a price close to her lower end or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's really my bottom line.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Our Limit:** Alice is holding firm at $11,000, which is above our strict $10,000 budget. 
* **No Guarantee of Further Compromise:** There's no indication that Alice will come down further, and we've already shown our hand by offering our maximum.
* **John's Offer is Safe:** We have a guaranteed alternative with John at $10,000. It makes more sense to take the sure deal rather than risk further negotiation with Alice for a relatively small potential saving."
