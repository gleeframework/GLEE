"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  It also signals that I believe the product is valuable and I'm not willing to settle for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$1,000,000 is far too low. I'm not willing to settle for that. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$1,250,000 is still too low for me. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, but if things don't improve, I'm ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,600,000.  This is still a significant profit for me and hopefully, we can reach a compromise with Bob. If he doesn't budge, I'm ready to accept John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher offer.  We're close to my bottom line, but I believe I can get a little more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm offering $1,450,000. This is a small concession, but it demonstrates my willingness to compromise.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'll likely have to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a difficult decision, as Bob's offer is close to my minimum. However, I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting a lower offer from Bob in the next round.  John's offer is guaranteed, and it's time to secure a sale."
