"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to your business. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
