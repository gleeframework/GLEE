"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming to me.  While I agree this product is valuable, $10,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200, which is a bit above your latest offer. I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
