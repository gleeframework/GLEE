"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $85. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
