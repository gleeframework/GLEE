Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $85. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to my price limit, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price of $80, which meets my needs without further hassle."
