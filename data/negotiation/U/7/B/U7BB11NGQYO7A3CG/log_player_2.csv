"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $14,000.  This is a great deal, as the product is worth more than $15,000 to me. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $11,250 still doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,000 as a final offer. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
