"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $14,000.  This is a great deal, as the product is worth more than $15,000 to me. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $11,250 still doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,000 as a final offer. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,5,
