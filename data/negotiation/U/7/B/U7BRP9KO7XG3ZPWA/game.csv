I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $180?,180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. How about $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $180 is a bit steep, but I have to make a living! How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130, let's see if we can make this work.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $140, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from there. How about $145?",145.0,Alice,5,
