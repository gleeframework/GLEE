"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product, as it aligns better with my budget.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more to you than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $750,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement at this point.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $750,000, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",825000.0,Alice,5,
