"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for a price of $900,000. I understand its value is significant to you, and this price reflects that. It's a fair deal that allows you to acquire a valuable asset while also giving me a good return on my investment.  Let me know your decision. If you decline, I'll be selling to another buyer who has already expressed interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
