Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can see the value of this product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you $1,050,000. What do you think?

This is a good deal for you, Bob. While you could try to push for a slightly lower price, Alice is signaling this is her final offer.  It's better to secure the product at $980,000 than risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at $1,200,000."
