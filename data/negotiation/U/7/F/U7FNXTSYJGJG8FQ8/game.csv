"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can see the value of this product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, my budget ceiling is $950,000.  If you're able to consider that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget ceiling is $950,000, but I'm still not convinced we've reached the right price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'll offer you $980,000. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",980000.0,Alice,5,
