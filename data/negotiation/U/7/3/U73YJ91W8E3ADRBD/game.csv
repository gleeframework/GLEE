"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be happy to buy it for $10500. Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is still a great deal for you considering its value.  Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
