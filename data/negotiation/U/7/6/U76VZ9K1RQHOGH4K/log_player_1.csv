Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $1,000,000 (her fallback offer from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $500,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,000,000) to be made if Bob buys at his maximum valuation.

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice needs to maximize her profit while ensuring Bob finds the offer acceptable. Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  I believe its true value is significant and I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000. I'm confident you'll find this a fair price considering its potential."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Fair Price:**  $1,350,000 captures a significant portion of the potential profit while leaving Bob with a $150,000 gain ($1,500,000 - $1,350,000).
* **Positive Messaging:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a fair deal, encouraging Bob to accept. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** If Alice believes Bob is particularly risk-averse, she might slightly lower the price to increase the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Relationship Value:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is valuable, a slightly more accommodating price could be strategic.

**This offer balances Alice's desire for maximum profit with the need to present an attractive offer to Bob.**"
