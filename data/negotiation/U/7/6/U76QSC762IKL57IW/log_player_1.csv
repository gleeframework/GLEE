Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know you recognize its value, and I believe it can significantly benefit you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,850,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** While the price is high, the message hints at the product's value and exclusivity, justifying the premium to an extent. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The message encourages Bob to respond, leaving room for potential negotiation if he finds the initial price too high.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings. If Bob accepts, you make a substantial profit. If he rejects, you still have your guaranteed sale to John."
