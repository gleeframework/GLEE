"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're confident it will meet all your needs. Let's make this a win-win situation. Would you consider purchasing it for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $110 is a good start, but there's room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $90?"", ""product_price"": 90} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer allows room for negotiation.  It's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, but it shows I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about considering the product for $95 instead? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

We're making progress! Alice came down $15, indicating a willingness to negotiate. Let's see if we can push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $92? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92}

**Reasoning:**  Alice dropping to $95 shows she's willing to negotiate. By countering at $92, I'm aiming for a price slightly below the midpoint, which is a common negotiation tactic and keeps the pressure on Alice to move closer to my desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're open to negotiation, Bob. Considering your feedback, how about we agree on $93 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate but is unlikely to go much lower than $93. This price is a good compromise, saving me $27 compared to John's offer. It's better to accept a good deal now than risk the negotiation stalling and potentially missing out on the savings."
