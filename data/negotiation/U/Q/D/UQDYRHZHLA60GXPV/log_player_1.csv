Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer starts by offering the product for $110, which is a decent starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to make the interaction more personal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $90 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  I think that's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $95 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely he won't go any higher. It's more beneficial to accept this offer than to risk losing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John for $120."
