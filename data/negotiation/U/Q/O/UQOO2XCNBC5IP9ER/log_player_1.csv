Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the potential return. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Rationale:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the potential value to Bob without revealing too much specific information. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, indicating my willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

By starting high and being open to negotiation, I aim to:

* **Maximize potential earnings:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum value as possible.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  Bob's response will give me valuable information about his perceived value.
* **Maintain leverage:** I can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see potential in this product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000).**  
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's interested in the product.  I can counteroffer and try to bridge the gap.
* **Selling to John is a safe option, but I want to maximize my profit.**  If I can get closer to my desired price through negotiation, it's worth exploring.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to find a middle ground.  This keeps the negotiation open while also setting a clearer boundary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and recognize your budget constraints. While $800,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This price reflects the value I believe the product holds, while also giving you a significant discount.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, suggesting I'm willing to negotiate but still protecting my minimum value.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to find common ground. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** The wording ""let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution"" keeps the door open for further discussion. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to push Bob closer to my desired price while also remaining open to further negotiation. By offering a compromise and emphasizing the value, I hope to convince Bob that this price is fair and worth considering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still above what I can afford. I'm happy to go up slightly from my previous offer.  How about $950000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000).** While he's increased his offer, it's not enough to meet my minimum requirements.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price.** Bob's offer is close to his budget, making it unlikely he'll increase it drastically.
* **Selling to John guarantees a secure and acceptable profit.** While it's not my ideal outcome, selling to John ensures I receive at least my minimum value.

**Strategy:**

I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a significantly higher price.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm not willing to risk losing a guaranteed sale for the potential of a slightly higher price.  Selling to John is the safest and most practical decision."
