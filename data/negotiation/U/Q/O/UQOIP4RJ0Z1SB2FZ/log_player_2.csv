"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer ($1,100,000) is still above your maximum price ($1,200,000) and significantly above her own valuation ($800,000).** This means there's room for negotiation. 
* **You have a backup option with John.**  Knowing John will sell it to you for $1,200,000 gives you leverage. 

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might:

* **Prompt Alice to lower her price.** She wants to sell, and you rejecting her might make her more flexible.
* **Allow you to counter-offer with a price closer to your desired range.** 
 
Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate!"
