"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $1,400,000. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? ",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would still be a fantastic deal for you considering the potential returns.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to come down to $1,250,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a successful deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
