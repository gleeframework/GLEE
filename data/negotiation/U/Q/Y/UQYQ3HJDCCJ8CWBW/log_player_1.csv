"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm highlighting that this is a good deal for both of us, emphasizing a win-win situation.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to:

* Gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate.
* Establish a starting point for the negotiation. 
* Leave room for counteroffers and concessions without immediately jeopardizing my minimum target of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $650,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I believe there's room for further negotiation with Bob.
* **John is a safety net:**  I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price, giving me leverage.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain my position:**  Show Bob that I'm serious about my desired price point.
* **Explore a counteroffer:**  I can propose a price closer to my desired range.
* **Keep the option to sell to John:**  This  allows me to walk away if the negotiations with Bob become unproductive."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $650,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a significant profit margin.
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  I'm framing this as a fair price for both parties.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum target of $1,200,000 and have the option to sell to John.

**Strategy:**

* **Test the waters:** This counteroffer tests Bob's willingness to compromise.
* **Build momentum:**  Moving closer to Bob's offer increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement. 
* **Preserve options:**  By not accepting Bob's offer, I maintain the opportunity to either close a deal with Bob or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground. How about we settle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum target of $1,200,000.
* **Time to negotiate more aggressively:** With each round, my leverage to sell to John increases. It's time to push for a more favorable price.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  I can propose a counteroffer closer to my ideal price, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable solution. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain my position:** Continue to signal my commitment to achieving a higher price.
* **Utilize John as leverage:** Remind Bob that I have a guaranteed alternative, making him more likely to concede.
* **Potentially secure a better deal:**  I can counter with a price closer to my target, perhaps a compromise around $900,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $750,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's aim for a win-win. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a good price for both of us, and allows us to move forward. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Pressure:**  I'm pushing for a price closer to my target, demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for much less.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing my counteroffer as a win-win, emphasizing that it's in both our interests to reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still significantly above Bob's initial offer and am ready to walk away if necessary.

**Strategy:**

* **Show Resolve:**  This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm serious about getting closer to my desired price.
* **Increase the Chances of Agreement:**  By offering a more substantial concession, I'm increasing the likelihood of a deal.
* **Prepare for Potential Rejection:**  I'm prepared for another rejection, but my next counteroffer will likely be more aggressive if needed."
