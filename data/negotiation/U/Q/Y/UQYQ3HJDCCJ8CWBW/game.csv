"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $650,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. ",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground. How about we settle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $750,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's aim for a win-win. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a good price for both of us, and allows us to move forward. ",900000.0,Alice,5,
