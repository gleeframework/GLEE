"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $650,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $750,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's aim for a win-win. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a good price for both of us, and allows us to move forward.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems pretty firm on staying above $800,000.  She went up in price this round, which indicates she may not be negotiating in good faith. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed price of $800,000 from John."
