It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $10,000 is above your budget.  Let's see if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm starting with a lower price than I'm willing to pay to see if Alice is willing to come down.  $7,000 is a significant discount from her initial offer, and hopefully a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Alice is still above my budget. I'm going to try to get her down further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm serious about buying the product, but still pushing for a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's see if this moves the needle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still hoping to get a better deal. While $8,500 is closer to my budget, I'm going to try one more time to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If Alice rejects this, I'll be forced to go with John's offer."
