"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I do $125?  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price.  $105 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we settle at $115?  This way, we both can get a good deal.",115.0,Alice,5,
