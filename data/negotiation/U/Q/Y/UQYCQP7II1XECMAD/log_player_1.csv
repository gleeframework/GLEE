Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for a price of $950,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, aiming higher with Bob first allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  A price of $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial ""discount"" compared to John's offer. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning other interested parties and a ""limited-time offer,"" you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. You can adjust your offer based on your understanding of Bob's negotiation style and risk tolerance."
