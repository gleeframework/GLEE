"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is a bit high for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $750000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $820000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $820000 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go up to $780000. This reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",780000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, $780000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $800000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product.  Let's settle this now.",800000.0,Alice,5,
