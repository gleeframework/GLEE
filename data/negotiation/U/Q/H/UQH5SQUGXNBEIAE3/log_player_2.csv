"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let's start our negotiation with this offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $850,000 is within Bob's budget, it's more than the product is worth to him.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit high for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $820000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still higher than Bob's target of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open for Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $820,000 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go up to $780,000. This reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 780000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, $780000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $800000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product.  Let's settle this now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is now at Bob's target price.  This is the best deal Bob can get from Alice, and it's equal to what he can get from John. Accepting the offer avoids the risk of further negotiation and ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price."
