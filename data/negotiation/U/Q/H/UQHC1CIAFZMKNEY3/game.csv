"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to talk to me. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $10,500? That gives you a great deal and allows me to make a fair profit. ",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be able to make a profit.",10000.0,Bob,4,
