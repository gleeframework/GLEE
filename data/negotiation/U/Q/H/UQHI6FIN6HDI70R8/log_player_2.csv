Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is worth around $7,000 to me, so I'll offer that price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $8,500? This gives us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm still thinking $7,000 is a fair price for the product, so I'll stick with that.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $7,000 is the maximum I can go. Can you consider that?"", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit. While I'd love to seal the deal, $7,000 just doesn't work for me. Let's try $8,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","This is getting close to the price I was hoping for. Since Alice's offer of $8,000 is just $100 more than what John is offering, I think it's a good idea to accept Alice's offer and save the extra $100.
