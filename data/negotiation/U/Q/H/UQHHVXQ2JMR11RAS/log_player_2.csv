"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $12,000 is far more than his maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,500.  This is my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. After reviewing the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. He should try to negotiate further to see if he can get closer to his $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair compromise and  a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go that low. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a very good price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still over his budget of $8,000.  Since Bob has a guaranteed option of buying from John for $8,000, it's the most financially sensible decision in this case.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks running the risk of her increasing the price again or becoming unwilling to negotiate further."
