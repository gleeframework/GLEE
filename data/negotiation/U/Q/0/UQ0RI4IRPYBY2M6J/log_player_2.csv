"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a steal at this price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget of $100 and John's offer of $100.  It makes the most sense to go with John's offer."
