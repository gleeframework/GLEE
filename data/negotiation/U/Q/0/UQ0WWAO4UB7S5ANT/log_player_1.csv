"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, making it more attractive.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If no deal is reached after a few rounds, I'll consider selling to John for my minimum price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $85 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is lower, it's clear he's interested in the product.  This means there's still potential to negotiate a price closer to my target.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $120, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer just yet.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my minimum price. I'll likely offer a price slightly above Bob's $85, but still below my minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget. I'm willing to come down a bit to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's last offer ($85) and my minimum acceptable price ($120). This shows I'm flexible and willing to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to maintain a good rapport with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a good price that's closer to my minimum.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his next counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'll likely continue to offer prices closer to my minimum until either Bob accepts or I choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. Can you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $90 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point of $120.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for improvement in the price, especially as Bob has shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer at this point, knowing I can always sell to John for $120. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my minimum price. I'll likely offer a price slightly above $90, but still below $120. I'll continue to adjust my offers based on Bob's responses, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try $92.50.  That's a good midpoint between our last offers and we can both get what we want. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  I'm offering a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Highlighting compromise:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is a compromise, making it more attractive to Bob.
* **Maintaining positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging to maintain a good rapport.

* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his next counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'm prepared to make a few more small increases in price until I reach my minimum price or decide to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my desired price point, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** There's very limited room for further negotiation, as Bob has stated that $92 is his maximum.
* **Selling to John is a viable option:** I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer at this point, knowing I can always sell to John for $120 and secure a higher profit. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get as close to my minimum as possible.  I'll likely offer a price slightly above $92, but still below $120, and emphasize the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Weighing options:** I'll continue to evaluate the potential for further negotiation with Bob, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if it becomes clear that a deal with Bob is unlikely."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, but $92 is still a bit below what I can do.  Let's try $98. That's a fair price considering the quality of the product and its value to you.  I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm making a small increase from Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still moving towards my minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm re-emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price increase.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly suggesting that I'm getting close to my limit, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to make a deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a price that's closer to my minimum and still acceptable to Bob.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to assess whether it's worth continuing with Bob or if it's better to sell to John. I may offer a final counteroffer close to my minimum before making that decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $98 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer: $88. If you can meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $88 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  Bob has stated that this is his final offer, leaving little room for further negotiations.
* **Selling to John is the best option:** Selling to John for $120 will guarantee me a much higher profit than accepting Bob's offer.  

**Next Steps:**

* I'm choosing to sell the product to John, as it's the most profitable and certain option at this point."
