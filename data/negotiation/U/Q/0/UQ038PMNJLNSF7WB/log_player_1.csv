Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price closer to what I am comfortable with. My counteroffer is $750,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a strong return. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, I still feel that $925,000 is quite high. Let's aim for a price closer to my initial proposal. My counteroffer is now $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a significant profit over John's offer of $800,000.  It's always possible to hold out for more, but there's a risk Bob will lower his offer or walk away in the next rounds. Taking the win now is a good strategic move."
