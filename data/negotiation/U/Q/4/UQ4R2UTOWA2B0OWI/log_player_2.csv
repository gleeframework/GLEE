Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you! I'm happy to keep working towards a deal. How about we try $109?  It's only a little bit higher than your last offer, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $109 is close to your desired price point and you're already past the halfway mark in the negotiation. There's a good chance you won't get a better deal, and continuing to haggle could lead to a stalemate or cause Alice to become unwilling to negotiate further. Accepting her offer secures the product at a good price."
