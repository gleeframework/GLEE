"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $105?  I'm really interested in this product.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at that price.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you! I'm happy to keep working towards a deal. How about we try $109?  It's only a little bit higher than your last offer, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.",109.0,Alice,5,
