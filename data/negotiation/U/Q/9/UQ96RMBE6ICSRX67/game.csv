"Hello Bob, I have a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell the product to you at a competitive price of $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While it's a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and agree on $10,750? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $10,750 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can do $11,200, which is a bit closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway again. However, $11,200 is still a bit more than I can manage right now. Let's try $11,000. This would be a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can do $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",11250.0,Alice,7,
