Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,000,000. However, I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. Would you be interested in discussing further?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting at our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** The message aims to understand Bob's level of interest. His response will help determine if we should negotiate closer to his valuation or proceed with John.
* **Alternative Option:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 gives us leverage.  We don't need to undervalue the product out of desperation.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how desperate he might be for the product."
