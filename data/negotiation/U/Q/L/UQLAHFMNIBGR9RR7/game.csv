"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $900,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated. However,  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Could we settle on $725,000? I think that's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, though. I'm willing to sell the product for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.",850000.0,Alice,5,
