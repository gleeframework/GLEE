"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,120.0
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $120 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $75?  That's a fair jump on my end and might be a good compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,90.0
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $90, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,,
