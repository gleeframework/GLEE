"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I've been following your work and I know you're looking for something that can really help you achieve [mention something specific to Bob's needs]. This product can do just that. I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair to both of us -  $1,200,000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident it will pay dividends for you. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
