"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get the product for a lower price than $13,000.  Alice values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice a price that's slightly above her perceived value of the product ($12,000). This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it shows I'm serious about buying but also want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I believe there's still room for negotiation, as she's willing to come down from her initial price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to make another counteroffer and try to push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and her latest offer is a bit higher than what I'd like.  I'm offering a price that's closer to her perceived value of the product ($12,000) but still allows for some profit for her. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while also aiming for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge much further. Her latest offer is only $250 lower than John's price, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a higher price.  It's more cost-effective to purchase the product from John at this point, as I'm guaranteed a price of $15,000, which is within my budget."
