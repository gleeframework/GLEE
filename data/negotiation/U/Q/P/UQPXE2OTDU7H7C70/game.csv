"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe a lower price point would make this a win-win for both of us. I'm confident this product will be valuable, but I need to ensure the price is right for my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I have to consider the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth while also being more in line with your budget. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,000,000. Could we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would allow both of us to achieve a fair outcome. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to stay close to my original target. I'm offering you a price of $1,075,000. This is a compromise that reflects the product's value while also showing my flexibility. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
