"I really like the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you wanting this product, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and settle on $130?  That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a bit more than selling it elsewhere.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the flexibility, Alice, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $115.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $115 is still a bit too far off for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $125.  This is a good price for both of us, and it will help me get closer to my desired price.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $120?",120.0,Bob,6,
