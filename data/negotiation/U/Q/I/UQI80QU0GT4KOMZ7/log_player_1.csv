Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy. 
* **Knowing the Alternatives:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 (John), so she shouldn't go below that price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $11,500, starting high leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, leading to a price that might be even closer to $12,000."
