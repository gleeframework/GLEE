Round 3
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible price point.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price, but I'd prefer to work with you. My final offer is $14,500.  This is a very reasonable price and allows us both to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from her $14,500 offer. Even if she negotiates a little more, the final price will likely be higher than John's offer of $10,000.  You've made it clear you're willing to pay more than your initial lowball offer, but it's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed better deal from John."
