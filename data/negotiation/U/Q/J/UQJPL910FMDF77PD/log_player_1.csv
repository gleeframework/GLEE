Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), but it's still a healthy profit margin for me and leaves room for negotiation. This initial offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest and hopefully start a productive conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm hoping to get.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $925,000 is a decent amount, it's still not quite where I want to be.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest counteroffer, again showing my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a fair price and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, it's clear that Bob isn't willing to budge much further on the price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $1,200,000, I don't want to risk further delays and potentially lose out on a sale altogether.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
