"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $7,000? I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while fitting my financial constraints.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $8,500. This is a fair compromise that still acknowledges the product's worth while being more in line with your budget. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,750? It's a significant step closer to your offer while staying within a reasonable range for me.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,750 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell the product for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering it to you for $8,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,
