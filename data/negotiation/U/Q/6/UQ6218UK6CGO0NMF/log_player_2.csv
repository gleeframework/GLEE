# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?

Alice's offer:

This is a fair compromise that still acknowledges the product's worth while being more in line with your budget. What do you think?

Alice is clearly committed to a slow approach to the price decrease, and we're getting close to John's offer.  It's time to accept and secure a decent discount."
