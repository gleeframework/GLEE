"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $10,000, which reflects the value it brings. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $6,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could be flexible, how about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $7,250. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,250 is closer, but I need to be closer to my bottom line. How about $8,000? This is my final offer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
