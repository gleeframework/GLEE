Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price increases my chances of a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is still a significant profit above my minimum ($150). It also leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal (as it's above his perceived value of $120). 
* **Time Value of Money:** A faster sale to Bob means I have the money sooner, which I could potentially reinvest or use elsewhere."
