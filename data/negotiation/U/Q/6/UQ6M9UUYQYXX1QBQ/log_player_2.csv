"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While Alice's offer of $140 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  You're better off going with the guaranteed lower price."
