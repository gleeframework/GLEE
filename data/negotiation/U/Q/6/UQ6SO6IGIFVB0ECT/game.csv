"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand you're hoping for a lower price, $12000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13500 and $12000, which would be $12750. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",12750.0,Bob,4,
