Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering what it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but potentially negotiable from his perspective is a good strategy.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (""given its value..."") helps make the offer seem more reasonable, even if Bob doesn't fully agree with your valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message hints at potential flexibility (""...What do you think?"") to encourage Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the initial price too high. 

**Important Note:** While you have a backup buyer, pushing Bob too hard (significantly above $20,000) might make him lose interest entirely without even trying to negotiate."
