It's time to take the sure thing! You can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above your budget.  There's no guarantee you'll get a better offer from Alice, and you're risking losing out on the product entirely if you keep negotiating.  It's time to cut your losses and go with John."
