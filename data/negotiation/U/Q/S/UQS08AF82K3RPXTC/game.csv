"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $10,500. This reflects its value to me, and I'm confident we can find a good deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your perspective, Bob.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
