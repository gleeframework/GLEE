Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I wouldn't offer it to just anyone. Given its potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and you have a guaranteed sale for that amount to John, you have room to negotiate higher.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a higher price ($1,500,000) sets an anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're more likely to land a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and exclusivity, subtly justifying the high price without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet in the middle. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's perspective and leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
