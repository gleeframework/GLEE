"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $9,500. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $7,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $6,800?",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $6,800. How about we try $7,200? It's a bit of a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  I'm getting close to my limit, though. How about $7,000? That's a firm offer.",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $7,200 again? I know I offered it to you in round 5, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7200.0,Alice,7,
