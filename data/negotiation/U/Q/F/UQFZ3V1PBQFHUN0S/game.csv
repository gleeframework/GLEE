"Alice, thanks for the offer! It's tempting, but I'm looking to get this product for a little less. Would you be willing to accept $900000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950000.
