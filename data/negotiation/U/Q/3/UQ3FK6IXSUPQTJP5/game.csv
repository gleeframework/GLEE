"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for it.  Let me know if that's a price we can work with.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1050000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $1100000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $1075000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think $1075000 is a bit too low. I can offer you the product for $1090000. This is my final compromise.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
