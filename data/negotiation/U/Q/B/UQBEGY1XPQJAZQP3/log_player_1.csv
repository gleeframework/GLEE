Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  $120 is above your minimum of $80.
* **Reasonable for Bob:**  $120 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), so he has room to negotiate if he wants to. 

This strategy aims to maximize your earnings while leaving room for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm happy to pay $100 for it,  let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is more than your minimum of $80, you can likely get a better price.  You have a good chance of getting closer to your initial offer of $120 by counteroffering.  Bob is already showing interest and is willing to pay more than your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
