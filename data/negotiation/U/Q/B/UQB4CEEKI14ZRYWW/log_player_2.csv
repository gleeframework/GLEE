This is a good starting point.  Alice's offer is too high.  You should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,400,000 is lower than my initial price, it's not quite what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can finalize this.

You should continue negotiating with Alice.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high, but you can probably get her to come down a bit more.  It's not worth buying from John yet, as you could potentially get a better price from Alice."
