"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) but still lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives us room to negotiate over the next few rounds without risking losing the deal completely. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  The message is friendly and sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my desired price:** While $10,000 is better than John's offer of $8,000, I believe I can still get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Room for further negotiation:**  There's still a gap between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price ($8,000).  I'm confident I can bridge that gap in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, I'm aiming for a price closer to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving down from my initial offer but staying above Bob's latest offer.  This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $11,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not giving away too much value.
* **Encouraging Dialogue:**  The message emphasizes the desire to find a middle ground, keeping the conversation open and encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above John's offer:**  $9,500 is better than selling to John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate.
* **Closing the gap:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, there's still some room for a compromise that's more favorable to me.
* **Strategic bargaining:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push him a bit further towards my target price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied with the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Compromise:** I'm dropping my price to $10,500, which is closer to Bob's offer and demonstrates a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Still above Minimum:** This price remains above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** The message emphasizes fairness and mutual satisfaction, hoping to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Last Chance:**  This is likely the last round where I can offer a higher price before considering John's offer."
