{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You still have room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It signals your willingness to compromise:** This encourages Bob to make a counteroffer. 

If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject and make a new offer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering it allows you to still make a significant profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to take the offer and avoid further negotiation, it's crucial to hold out for a better price.  I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $700,000 is too far below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a reasonable profit, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? This is a significant increase from my previous offer and keeps us  below your initial asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I need to hold firm and see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a compromise closer to my desired range."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $775,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close!  I appreciate your willingness to come down further in price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.  If it's acceptable to you, we have a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly the value of the product to him, and it is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, it's not guaranteed that I can get a better price.  It's unlikely that Bob will offer more, and John, the other buyer, is willing to pay $1,000,000. It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than risk getting nothing by continuing to negotiate."
