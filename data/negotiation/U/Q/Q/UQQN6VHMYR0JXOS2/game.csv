"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product has potential, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start the conversation at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1,050,000 to make this deal work. This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and agree on $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $925,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's go with $975,000.  This price is still below the product's true value, but it shows my willingness to compromise.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $975,000 is close, I'm aiming for something a little sharper. How about we settle this right now for $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,6,
