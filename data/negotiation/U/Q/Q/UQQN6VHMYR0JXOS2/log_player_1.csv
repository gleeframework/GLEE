Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product has potential, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start the conversation at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum, and I believe I can still negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1,050,000 to make this deal work. This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and agree on $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $925,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $1,000,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $925,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's go with $975,000.  This price is still below the product's true value, but it shows my willingness to compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $975,000 is close, I'm aiming for something a little sharper. How about we settle this right now for $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a higher price from Bob,  I've reached my limit for negotiation.  It's better to secure a guaranteed deal for my minimum price than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with less."
