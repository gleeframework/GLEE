"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $900000? This still leaves a significant profit margin for you and allows me to get a fair price for my product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
