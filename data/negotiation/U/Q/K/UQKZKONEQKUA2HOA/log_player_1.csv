Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is higher than your minimum price of $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $14,000 is lower than the product's value to Bob ($15,000), giving him incentive to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still potentially negotiate a higher price. 

Remember,  you can always fall back on selling to John for $12,000 if you don't get a satisfactory price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting his offer would leave you with less money than you'd get by selling to John. 

**Next Steps:**

Since you've rejected Bob's offer, you'll proceed to the next round of negotiation. You can now make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to your desired range (above $12,000)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of your own financial goals. 
* **Reasoning:**  You've provided a reason for your counteroffer, reminding Bob of the product's worth.
* **Middle Ground:**  $13,000 is a midpoint between your previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($11,500). This suggests a willingness to find common ground.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining a price point that's more favorable to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting his offer would net you a profit, which is your goal. While you could potentially try to negotiate a higher price, there's no guarantee Bob would agree, and you risk losing the deal entirely.

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:** Accepting the offer ensures you make a profit.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away, forcing you to sell to John for a lower price. 
* **Time:**  Accepting Bob's offer saves you time and effort in further negotiations. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice in this scenario."
