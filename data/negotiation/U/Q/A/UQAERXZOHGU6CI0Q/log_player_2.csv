"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it's worth negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $8,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, as I'm still willing to pay a premium for the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,500. I understand that's a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value to you and the value to me. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what you can get from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. This would allow me to purchase the product while ensuring you get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value to you and the value to me. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

While $9,250 is a good price, it's still more than you can get from John. At this point, it's better to go with the guaranteed lower price from John.  Further negotiation with Alice might get you a better price, but there's no guarantee, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy from John."
