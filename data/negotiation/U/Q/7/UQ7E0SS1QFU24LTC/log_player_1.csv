Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm looking for a buyer who recognizes its true value. I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more than your minimum selling price. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will give you valuable information. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he negotiates, you can then work towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John, ensuring you won't be forced to sell below your minimum price. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
