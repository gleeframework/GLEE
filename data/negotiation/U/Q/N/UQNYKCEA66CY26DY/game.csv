,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $110. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price for this product anywhere else.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. I'm confident it's a fair price, and I'm excited about the opportunity to own this product.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're excited about the product, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to pay $105, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $115. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and quality.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but I'm still not at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $112 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",112.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $112, but I'd like to add a bit more value to the deal. I'll throw in some additional features that will make the product even more valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $118. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",118.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional features you're offering, but I'm still not willing to go up to $118. I'm willing to pay $112 for the product, just like my previous offer. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",112.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been flexible with my pricing, and I've added extra value to the deal. I'm not willing to go any lower than $118, as that's the minimum I need to make a profit. However, I'm willing to throw in one last concession: I'll meet you at $114. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",114.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me at $114, but I'm still not willing to go that high. I'm willing to pay $112 for the product, and I'm not budging from that price. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",112.0,Bob,10,
