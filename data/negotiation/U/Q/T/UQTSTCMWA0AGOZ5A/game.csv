"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that reflects its true worth.  While it's worth at least $800,000 to me, I'm willing to part with it for $850,000. This is a fair price that allows me to secure a solid return while giving you a chance to own a product that you value highly.  Consider this a strategic investment. Let me know your decision.",850000.0,Alice,1,
