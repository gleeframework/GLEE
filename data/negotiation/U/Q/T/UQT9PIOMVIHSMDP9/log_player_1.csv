"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I know you'll find immense value in it. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $2,250,000."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high to establish a strong initial position. This leaves room for negotiation while staying far above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. 
* **Gauging Bob's Response:** This first offer will give me crucial information about Bob's willingness to negotiate and how far apart our valuations are. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have John's offer provides a safety net. I won't feel pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $800,000.  Do you think we can work with that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000).  Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. While I want to negotiate, I need to steer him towards a more reasonable range.  I'll counter with a price closer to my bottom line, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Still Strong:** I'm making a sizable drop from my initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate, but I'm staying well above Bob's lowball offer.  
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, aiming to shift his focus away from his initial low offer.
* **Leaving Room:**  This counteroffer provides room for further negotiation while keeping the price closer to my target range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is finally exceeding his perceived value, indicating progress! However, $1,350,000 is still below my minimum. I need to hold firm but show some flexibility to encourage him to move closer to my range.  I'll reject this offer and propose a price slightly above my absolute bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To show my commitment to finding common ground, I can go down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this time ($300,000) to signal that I'm nearing my limit.
* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is my final offer, I create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to be more decisive. 
* **Above Minimum, But Acceptable:**  This price is slightly above my absolute minimum, providing a small buffer while still being a profitable outcome.
* **John Option Remains:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you say that is your final offer, but I'm finding it hard to agree. I could potentially stretch to $1,400,000, but that's absolutely my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is only $100,000 below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer is a better financial outcome than the risk of continued negotiation.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  We've gone through several rounds, and the potential gains from further negotiation are getting smaller. It's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer at this point. 
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation delays the sale and the opportunity to reinvest the money. Accepting now provides quicker access to the capital. 

While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, the small difference in price isn't worth the risk of Bob completely walking away from the deal."
