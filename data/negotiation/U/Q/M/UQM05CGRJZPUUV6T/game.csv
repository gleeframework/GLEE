"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be happy to pay $900,000 for the product, as I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 for this to make sense for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  That's a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the current market value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, I can't go below $1,000,000 for this product. It represents a significant value that I'm confident will benefit you.  This is my final offer,  I believe it's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
