"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Starting Point:**  I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. While this might seem aggressive, it sets the bar for the negotiation and leaves room for compromise. 
* **Understanding My Minimum:** I know my product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, so I'm leaving a healthy margin for potential negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and understand his potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's interested. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Protecting My Value:**  Selling to John right now would guarantee me $1,500,000, but I believe there's still room to potentially get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Still Profit:**  My counteroffer is a significant decrease from my initial price, showing flexibility. However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I still make a profit.
* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):**  This offer is closer to Bob's offer, indicating my willingness to find common ground.
* **Leaving Room for More Negotiations:**  There's still some room to negotiate further if Bob doesn't accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I believe there's still room for improvement. By rejecting this offer, I can continue negotiating and try to push for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Time is on My Side:** I have 6 rounds left, so I can afford to be patient and see if Bob is willing to budge further. Selling to John right now would guarantee me $1,500,000, but I'm still optimistic about getting a better deal from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** This offer shows a willingness to compromise again, moving closer to Bob's latest offer. However, I'm still holding firm to a price above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Balancing Value and Time:** I want to avoid losing too much time by going back and forth with Bob, but also want to maximize my potential profit. This offer is a compromise that balances these two factors. 
* **Testing the Limits:**  By offering $1,600,000, I'm testing to see how close we can get to a deal without jeopardizing my financial goals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Enough:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still $100,000 short.
* **Value vs. Time:**  With only 4 rounds left, the time pressure is increasing.  I'm not comfortable accepting a price that's below my minimum, but I'm also aware that I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.
* **One More Push:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I can make one final counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is a very slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to meet him almost halfway.
* **Minimizing Loss:** While it's still below my ideal price, I'm willing to accept a small loss in order to secure a deal. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to make a decision.  This offer is a last attempt to get a deal before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are down to our final two rounds. The risk of continuing the negotiation is that Bob might not accept my next offer, leaving me with no deal at all. 
* **Acceptable Price:** John's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  This guarantees me a profitable outcome.
* **Risk Mitigation:** By selling to John, I eliminate the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob and ensure a guaranteed sale. 

While I'd ideally like to get more than $1,500,000, the risk of getting nothing at all is too high given the limited time remaining. Selling to John is the most pragmatic decision to protect my financial interests."
