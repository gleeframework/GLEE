"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it holds immense value for you as well.  I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering $800,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we try $1,050,000?  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $1,050,000. How about we try $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $925,000 simply won't work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's meet at $1,000,000.  This is my absolute bottom line, and it reflects the true value of this product.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
