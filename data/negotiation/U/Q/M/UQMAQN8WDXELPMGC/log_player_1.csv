Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering $800,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we try $1,050,000?  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $1,050,000. How about we try $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'll continue to negotiate with him in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $925,000 simply won't work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's meet at $1,000,000.  This is my absolute bottom line, and it reflects the true value of this product.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
