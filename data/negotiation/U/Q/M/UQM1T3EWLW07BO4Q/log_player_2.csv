"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $14,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Rationale: While the offer is higher than Alice's value, it's still lower than your maximum price and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $500 compared to buying from John."
