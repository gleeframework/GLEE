"I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me at this price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you consider this price?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  $115 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. To make this a win-win, how about we meet at $120?  That's a small step up for you, and it gets me closer to my target price.",120.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with $120. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. I think that's a fair price, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can you consider this price?",110.0,Bob,6,
