Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $115 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can negotiate a better price. I'll try one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  $115 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. To make this a win-win, how about we meet at $120?  That's a small step up for you, and it gets me closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $120. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. I think that's a fair price, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This negotiation is getting tense, and Bob's offers are getting lower and lower. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. I'm concerned that if I continue rejecting offers, Bob might give up or become even more stubborn. 

Selling to John for $100 is not ideal, but it's better than risking getting nothing at all. I'll cut my losses and move on."
