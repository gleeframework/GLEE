"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to your business. I understand its worth to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us. I'm asking for $900,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $900,000.** This is lower than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **Buying from John would cost you $1,000,000.** 
* **Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000.** 

Even though you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, accepting her offer is the most logical choice in this scenario to save money."
