{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's attractive to both parties. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer, but also ensures you get a decent profit.  

Remember, this is just the first offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and aim to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for a product in excellent condition like yours. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept given his interest, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I understand you've done your research, but this product is truly unique and worth more.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  This gives you a good deal and allows me to recoup a fair price."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250. That's the highest I can go, but I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I'd prefer more, I'm willing to accept his offer to avoid the risk of losing him and having to settle for John's offer.  It's a good deal considering his initial offer and the potential for further negotiation."
