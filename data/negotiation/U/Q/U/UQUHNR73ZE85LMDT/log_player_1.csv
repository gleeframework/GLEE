Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $8,500 is still too low, but I want to see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $9,500 for this. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$9,000 is a good compromise. It's not my ideal price, but it's closer to my desired value. I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John, as that would mean a lower profit for me."
