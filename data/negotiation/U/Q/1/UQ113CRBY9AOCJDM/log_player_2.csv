"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value and the benefits it provides, I propose a price of $11,000 for this exceptional item. This price not only ensures a fair return for us but also offers you an excellent opportunity to maximize your investment with a product that is worth $12,000 to you. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially lower the price further. Even if she doesn't budge, you're not losing anything by moving to John."
