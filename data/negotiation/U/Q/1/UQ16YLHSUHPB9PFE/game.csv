"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident we can reach a price that benefits us both. I'd like to start the negotiations at $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This would still be a significant profit for you and would allow us to close the deal quickly.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're looking for a fair price. While $1,200,000 is a substantial sum, I'm confident this product's unique value warrants a higher investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,300,000.  However, I'm still a bit too high.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,250,000.  This price would allow us both to close the deal, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
