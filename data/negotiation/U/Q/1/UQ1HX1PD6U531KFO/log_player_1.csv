{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $12,000, and leaves room for negotiation. I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. However, I am interested in discussing a potential compromise. Would you consider selling the product for $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is still a little below what I'm hoping to get. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my goal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
