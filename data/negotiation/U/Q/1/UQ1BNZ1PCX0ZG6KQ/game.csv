"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the market value.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $11000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10500, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I'd like to add a bit more value to the deal. How about I throw in a premium service package that's worth $500? That way, you'll get the product and some extra perks for the same price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer of the premium service package, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I'd like to remove the premium service package from the deal. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in the conversation, Bob. I'm willing to remove the premium service package from the deal, as you requested. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10000. I'm confident that the product is worth it, and I'm willing to stand firm at this price. I'm not budging from $10000.",10000.0,Alice,7,
