"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is its fair market value.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, while I understand your perspective, I'm still not comfortable going above $800,000. This product is valuable to me, but it's crucial I stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can close the deal at my original offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I respect your budget constraints, but I also need to ensure a fair deal. How about we consider a structured payment plan? We could agree on $800,000 upfront, with an additional $100,000 paid over two installments.",900000.0,Alice,5,
