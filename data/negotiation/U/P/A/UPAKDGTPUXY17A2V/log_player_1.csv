Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn an extra $100,000 if Bob accepts your offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets it for $300,000 less than its worth to him, and you earn a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Exclusivity Incentive:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a touch of urgency and might make Bob more inclined to accept before he potentially loses out."
