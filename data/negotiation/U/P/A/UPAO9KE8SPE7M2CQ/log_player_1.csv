"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too much to scare him off right away. I'm aiming for a good negotiation, and I believe this offer will open the door for a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price of $12,000, and I'm not willing to sell it for less than that. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate and come down slightly from my initial offer. This should hopefully encourage Bob to continue negotiating and get closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum price of $12,000, and I'm not willing to sell it for less than that.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, but if he rejects my offer again, I'll be ready to sell to John to ensure I don't lose out on my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12200}
```

This time, I'm bringing my offer down to $12,200. It's closer to Bob's offer and shows I'm serious about closing the deal.  I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price, but with only 5 rounds left, I need to make some progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting frustrating. Bob's offers are stubbornly low, and I'm running out of time.  I've reached my limit in terms of lowering my price, and I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value.  I'll take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
