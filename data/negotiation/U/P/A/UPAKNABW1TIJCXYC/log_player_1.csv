Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, $1,500,000, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  This leaves room for negotiation if he's not. I'm confident I can get more than the $1,000,000 from John, so I'm willing to risk some back and forth with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, and even lower than selling to John.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hopefully finding a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still higher than selling to John and closer to my desired value. I'm hoping this compromise will be attractive enough to Bob while still leaving room for some negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While it's still a bit lower than I'd like, it's higher than what I'd get from John, and I don't want to risk a prolonged negotiation that could result in losing the deal altogether. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
