Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This gives me a potential profit of $100,000 over my minimum acceptable price, while still leaving room for Bob to potentially make a good deal.  

This is a strategic approach:

* **Higher price:** It encourages Bob to consider the value of the product to him.
* **Not too high:** It leaves some room for negotiation and avoids outright rejection.
* **Backup plan:**  If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $800,000."
