"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $8,000, so this offer is already significantly above that.
* **Bob's value:** I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, so this price leaves room for negotiation and still gives him a good deal.
* **First offer:**  I'm starting high to see if I can get close to my ideal price. I want to gauge his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I'm confident I can get a better price.  I still have 9 rounds to negotiate.
* **John is a backup:**  John offers a guaranteed $8,000, which is my minimum, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above minimum:** $8,500 is still higher than my minimum and John's offer, so it's still a good deal for me. 
* **Testing the waters:** This offer is a good way to see how close Bob is to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.
* **No guarantee of better:**  There's no guarantee that I'll get a higher offer in the remaining rounds.  
* **Time is a factor:** With only 6 rounds left, I risk losing out on a sale.
* **John's offer:**  I could sell to John for $8,000, but Bob's offer achieves the same result with less risk."
