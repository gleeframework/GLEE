Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,500,000) to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Above John's Offer:** This offer ensures we get a better price than selling to John ($1,200,000), even if Bob negotiates down a bit.

By starting high but still leaving Bob with a potential gain, we increase the chances of closing a deal that's significantly profitable."
