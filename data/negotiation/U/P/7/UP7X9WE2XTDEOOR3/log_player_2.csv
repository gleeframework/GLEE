"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's on the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget and John's offer. There's still room for negotiation, and you have 7 rounds left. Rejecting allows for further negotiation, potentially leading to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.  I'm open to finding a solution, so I'm willing to drop to $975,000. This is my final offer, as it's already a considerable reduction from my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above what you're willing to pay, but it's closer to your budget.  Rejecting this offer gives you a chance to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price. You have 5 rounds remaining, so there's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that benefits us both. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of the product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
