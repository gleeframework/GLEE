"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher figure.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 900000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the reply. I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we potentially agree on $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Explanation: While Bob is moving upward, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that surpasses John's offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer is a $100,000 loss compared to John. It's strategically sound to cut losses and secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
