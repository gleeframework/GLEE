"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, and I understand your position.  However, I know the true value of this product, and I can't go as low as $10,500.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,000?  It's a win-win situation for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
