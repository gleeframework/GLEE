"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle? Would you be willing to consider $550,000?",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we settle on $700,000?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $700,000 is closer, it's still a little too high for me. Could you consider $620,000? That would make this a workable deal for me.",620000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $620,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm still making a reasonable profit. How about we meet at $675,000?",675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $675,000 is getting close, but to make this work on my end, I'd need to be at $640,000.  Do you think we could make that work?",640000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $675,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm still making a reasonable profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $675,000 and $640,000. How about we settle on $662,500?",662500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $650,000? This is a fair offer considering we're almost at the end of our negotiation.",650000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still making a reasonable profit. How about we meet at $658,000?",658000.0,Alice,9,
