You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a higher price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about $14,000? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 14000}
