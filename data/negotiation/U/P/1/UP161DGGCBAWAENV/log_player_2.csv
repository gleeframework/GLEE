"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to your target of $800,000, it's still a significant overpayment. You have a better alternative with John, and there's a chance Alice might come down further in subsequent rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's closer to my desired price of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Alice will be willing to negotiate further, considering she values the product at $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $900,000 is still higher than my ideal price.  I'm going to reject her offer and continue to negotiate. I believe I can still get a better price, especially since I have a guaranteed option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $875,000. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still firmly within my desired price range. I believe this counteroffer will be attractive to Alice, considering her own valuation of the product and the possibility of further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has dropped her price a little, it's still not within my desired price range.  Negotiating further with her might result in a slightly lower price, but there's no guarantee.  It's unlikely that she'll come down significantly enough to make it worthwhile.  Since I have a guaranteed option with John for $800,000, it's more sensible to secure the product at that price and avoid further negotiation."
