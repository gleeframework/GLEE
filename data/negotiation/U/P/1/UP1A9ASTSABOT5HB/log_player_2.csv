Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay closer to $11,000, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $12,500. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

```

**Reasoning:**

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be. Let's try $12,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob is showing a willingness to compromise by increasing his offer, but only by a small amount. This shows Alice he's serious about buying but still wants a good deal.  The message also emphasizes the fairness of the offer for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my initial investment. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $12,750. It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,750 is within Bob's budget and only slightly above his last counteroffer of $12,000.  While Bob might prefer a lower price, it's likely that further negotiation would only result in a small price reduction, if any.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible option, securing the product while saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
