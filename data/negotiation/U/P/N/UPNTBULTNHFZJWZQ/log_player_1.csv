Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is significantly less than my minimum value ($1,200,000) but still higher than what Bob values it at ($800,000). 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

* **Start high:** I'm offering a price closer to my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Leave room for counteroffers:** The gap between my offer and Bob's perceived value allows for potential negotiation and a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  The offer highlights my willingness to negotiate but also subtly reminds Bob that I have another buyer willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value than his initial rejection, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I want to try and push for a higher price.  

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiate further:** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's a possibility we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I maintain my leverage and signal that I'm not desperate for a sale. 
* **Aim for a price closer to my minimum:** In the next round, I'll aim for a counteroffer closer to $1,000,000 or even higher, depending on how determined Bob seems to be."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer. 
* **Reasoning:**  The message explains my rationale for the counteroffer, emphasizing fairness and compromise. 
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** By focusing on ""fair price for both of us,"" I subtly suggest that we're both better off reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain pressure:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing that I'm not willing to settle for a low price.
* **Test the waters:** My counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to increase his offer further.
* **Stay close to my minimum:** I'm still aiming to get as close to my minimum value as possible while remaining open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $920,000, but no more. Can you meet me in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough.  I've already made a significant concession, and the difference between $920,000 and my minimum of $1,200,000 is still substantial.  

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me the highest possible profit, fulfilling my goal of earning as much as possible. 
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take time and may not result in a significantly better price. 
* **No risk:** By selling to John, I avoid any further negotiation risks or potential for a lower offer from Bob. 

In this situation, it's more advantageous to accept the guaranteed offer from John and secure a profitable sale."
