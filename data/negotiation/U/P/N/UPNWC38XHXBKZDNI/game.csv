"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. Would you consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value it brings.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value I'm willing to pay.",950000.0,Bob,4,
