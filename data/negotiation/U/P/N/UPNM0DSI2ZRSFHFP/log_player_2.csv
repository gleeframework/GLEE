"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering its worth and the potential benefits it holds. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss further details. However, if this isn't something you're interested in, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to purchase it for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
