"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, he has some incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not willing to accept his initial low price.  This should hopefully encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good price.  It's above my minimum and getting closer to what I initially wanted.  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's not worth risking a further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing."
