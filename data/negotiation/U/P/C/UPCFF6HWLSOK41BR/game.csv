"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, which is closer to your price point. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Alice,5,
