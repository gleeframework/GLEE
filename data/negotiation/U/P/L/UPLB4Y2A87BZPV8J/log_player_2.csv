You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $80. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $95. It's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you. What do you think?

You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to my price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still looking to get as close to my minimum price as possible. How about we try $92? It's a bit of a compromise, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While I could try to haggle further, there's a risk she won't budge much, and I might end up paying closer to $100 anyway.  Accepting $92 secures a decent discount and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
