"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $100 for it. This is a special offer considering its worth to you is $120. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120, you know you have an alternative seller (John) willing to sell it for $120.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice by rejecting her initial offer."
