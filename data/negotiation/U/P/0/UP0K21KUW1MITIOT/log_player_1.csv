{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $120. This is higher than Bob's valuation of $80, but still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to be friendly and enthusiastic to create a positive rapport with Bob. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming for a compromise that's beneficial for both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I can still make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses and try to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  While it's closer to my desired price than his initial valuation, I'm not yet willing to settle for $90.
* **I'm choosing to reject his offer and counteroffer.** I believe I can still achieve a higher price through negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll try to find a price that's closer to my desired price but still within a reasonable range that Bob might accept."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm raising the price from $90 to $110. This is still lower than my initial offer of $120, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate while staying above my minimum price of $150.
* **Message:** I'm staying positive and emphasizing the possibility of finding a compromise. 
* **Strategy:** I'm trying to bridge the gap between our valuations, aiming for a mutually agreeable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I can further adjust my counteroffer based on his responses. 

**Note:** This is a crucial step as I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a good price and not losing the deal to John."

* **I'm choosing to reject his offer and counteroffer.** I believe I can still achieve a higher price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $100 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm increasing the price slightly to $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $100.
* **Message:** I'm highlighting the benefits of accepting the offer for both of us, emphasizing that it's a ""good deal.""  I'm also trying to build on the positive rapport we established earlier. 
* **Strategy:** I'm trying to find a sweet spot where the price is acceptable to both of us. This is a critical round, as a rejection could lead to a stalemate or potentially selling to John for $150.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to making a decision, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $98? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  While it's closer to my desired price than his initial valuation, I'm not yet willing to settle for $98.
* **I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $150.**  I've reached a point where I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob, and I'm willing to take the guaranteed $150 from John.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Factor:**  The negotiation has gone on for several rounds, and it's possible that further negotiation with Bob would lead to a stalemate or take too much time.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring a profit.
* **Risk Aversion:**  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement, and I'll end up with nothing. Selling to John eliminates that risk.

**Conclusion:**

Given the circumstances, selling to John for $150 is the most rational decision, maximizing my profit and minimizing risk."
