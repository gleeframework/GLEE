Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I think this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation maximizes your potential profit while still being reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong opening offer, starting higher leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
