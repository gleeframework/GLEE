"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, right? I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, and you'd be getting a fantastic product for a lower price than you'd normally pay. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While her offer of $11,500 is below your maximum, you know you have John as a fallback option at $12,000. There's a chance you could get a better price by:

* **Negotiating with Alice:**  Rejecting her first offer might lead her to propose a lower price. 
* **Sticking with John:**  $12,000 is your absolute limit, and sometimes it's better to have a sure thing than risk further negotiation."
