"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $75 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $85 for the product. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
