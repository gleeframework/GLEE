"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. This is an exclusive opportunity to own a piece worth more than its value to you, and it's a chance to secure it before we potentially sell it to another interested party. Let's make this deal happen!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To make things more agreeable for both of us, how about we aim for a middle ground? I propose $105 for the product. It's still a good deal for you, considering its worth, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $100 for the product, which is the price John is offering. Let me know if you're open to that.",100.0,Bob,4,
