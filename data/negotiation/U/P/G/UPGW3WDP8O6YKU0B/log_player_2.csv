You're better off trying to get a lower price from Alice.  $115 is still above your maximum price of $100."

You can still do better than $110.  You're close to your maximum, but it's still worthwhile to try to negotiate further."

Alice is now firm on $110, which is above your maximum. Since John offers the product for $100, it's best to take his offer."
