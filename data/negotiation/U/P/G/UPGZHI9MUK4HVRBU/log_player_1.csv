While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,190,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** This offer still provides a profit of $190,000 over my minimum. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  After 6 rounds, continuing might make Bob walk away.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means I have the capital available for other opportunities. 

Accepting a slightly lower offer outweighs the risk of losing Bob as a buyer entirely and having to settle for John's lower offer."
