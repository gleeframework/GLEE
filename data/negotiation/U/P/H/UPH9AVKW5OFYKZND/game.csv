"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $140?  It's a great price for a fantastic product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. Let's meet in the middle.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $100 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $120? That's still a fair price for the quality of this product.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $110. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to go with John's offer.",110.0,Bob,6,
