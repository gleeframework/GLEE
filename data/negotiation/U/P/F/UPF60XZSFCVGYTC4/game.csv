"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I'm confident you'll find the product more than worth that price.  Let's keep the negotiations moving!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Can we consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $10,250?  It's a small step closer to your offer, and it would allow us to finalize the deal.  Let's make this happen!",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still a bit short. How about we try $9,800? It's the best I can do, and I'm really interested in making a deal with you.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,800. I'm really close to closing this deal with you, but I need to be at $10,000 to make it work. It's a small difference, and I'm confident you'll find the value of the product worth it.  Let's find a way to make this happen, or we might need to explore other options.",10000.0,Alice,7,
