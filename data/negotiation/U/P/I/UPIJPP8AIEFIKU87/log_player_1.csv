Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
 
* **Reasoning:** Starting with a strong initial offer slightly below Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This offer reflects the value I see in it and is a good starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While $950,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both Bob's perceived value and my initial asking price.  There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter to reach a more agreeable figure before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  It's clear we both recognize the inherent value of this product.  To find a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a fair return on this unique item."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer and my previous price, demonstrating flexibility while still pushing for a higher profit. This keeps the negotiation active and avoids a stalemate."
