"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's, but still above my ideal price. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $10,500 is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Showing Interest:** The message emphasizes my interest in the product while expressing my budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. Let me know if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can get closer to my desired price. There are still several rounds left, and I believe a lower price is achievable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm comfortable going to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer by $500, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying within my budget.
* **Reasonable Counter:** $11,000 is a reasonable offer, considering Alice's previous counter and my budget. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, aiming to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to go up to $11,000, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $11,000, which would be $12,750. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,750 is still too high for my budget. At this point, with only 5 rounds remaining, I don't see a good chance of getting Alice to go lower. It's more financially beneficial to buy the product from John for $10,000, even though I was hoping to get a lower price."
