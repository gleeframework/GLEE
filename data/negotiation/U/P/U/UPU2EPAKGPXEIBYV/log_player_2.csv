You can do better than $11,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

You're still a little higher than what you want to pay, but you're close.  See if you can get Alice down further."

While Alice has come down in price, it's still a bit higher than your budget. It's worth going with the guaranteed price from John at this point."
