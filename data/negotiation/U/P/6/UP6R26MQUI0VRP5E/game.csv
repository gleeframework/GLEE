"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm happy to pay $120 for it, which is a fair price considering I'm your first customer for this item.  What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your honest feedback, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a stretch for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $135 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  How about $125?  It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $130. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
