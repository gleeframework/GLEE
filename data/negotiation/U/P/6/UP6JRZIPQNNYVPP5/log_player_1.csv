Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $2,200,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my means. I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I still need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me. I'd like to propose a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.
