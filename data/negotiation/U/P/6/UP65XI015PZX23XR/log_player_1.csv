Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downward.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm explicitly stating I'm open to negotiation, which signals flexibility and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Building Interest:** I'm emphasizing the product's value (""fantastic product"") to pique Bob's interest.

This approach allows me to assess Bob's interest level while leaving room to potentially secure a higher price than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase it. However, based on my research and budget, I am only able to offer $14500 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to reject his offer and attempt to counteroffer to secure a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While it's closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to go down to $14,750.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14750} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** I'm showing respect for his offer and not dismissing it outright.
* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm proposing a price that's slightly lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's. 
* **Finding Common Ground:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us. This keeps the conversation positive and encourages further negotiation.

By taking a smaller step in price, I'm hoping to signal my willingness to compromise while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I've reviewed the situation again and would like to propose $14600 as the price for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $14,600 is very close to my desired price point.  While I could potentially continue to negotiate, the potential gains are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that's significantly higher than my minimum and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
