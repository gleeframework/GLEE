"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for, but I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,125,000. I think this product is worth every penny of that price, and I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'm willing to meet you at $1,125,000. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to shake hands and close the deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
