Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $1200000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $950000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a good profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm happy to offer $1000000. This is a fair price that considers both our interests, and it allows for a smooth transaction.  What do you think?
