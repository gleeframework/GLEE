Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than your minimum. This should encourage Bob to consider the offer.  If he rejects, you can still go to John for $12,000, ensuring you don't lose out."
