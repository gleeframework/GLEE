Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

This is a high starting offer, but it allows for room to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price above my minimum value of $1,500,000, hoping to maximize my profit. I'll be prepared to counter any reasonable offer from Bob, and if he becomes too stubborn, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  I need to try to negotiate a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm still aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but I'm willing to come down a bit to see if we can reach an agreement. This counteroffer is a compromise, but it still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum value.  It's better than selling to John for $1,500,000 and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
