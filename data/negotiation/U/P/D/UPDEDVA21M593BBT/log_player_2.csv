Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we're getting close.  I value your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for the full asking price.  However, I believe in your vision for this product, and I'd like to see us close this deal.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $812,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500.

It's time to cut your losses.  Alice is clearly very firm on her price, and you have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000. It's unlikely Alice will go that low, especially since she mentioned another offer at her full asking price."
