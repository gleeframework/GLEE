"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob thinks it's worth, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while also showing that I'm serious about selling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $1750000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I need to try and negotiate a higher price, but I also need to consider how many rounds are left. Selling to John is always an option, but I'm going to try to get a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but that's the lowest I can go.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  I want to show him that I'm willing to compromise, but not at the cost of my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1250000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1100000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to try to push for a slightly higher price, but I'm also aware that we're running out of rounds. Selling to John is always an option, but I'm going to try to get a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  $1,100,000 is a good step, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's latest offer but still below my minimum. I'm trying to show that I'm willing to compromise, but also maintain a price that's fair to me.  I'm hoping that Bob will agree to this offer, as we're getting close to the middle ground."
