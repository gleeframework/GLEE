Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,000,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still below my minimum. To be fair, let's meet in the middle at $975,000. This price is a significant gain for you, considering the value you place on this product. I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $962,500? That's a good compromise, and it reflects the value of this product to you. Let's close this deal and move forward.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Good Price:**  $962,500 is a significant saving compared to John's $1,500,000 price.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental savings. Alice is clearly aiming for a price above $950,000.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation for a few thousand dollars isn't worth the potential risk of Alice walking away or the deal falling through."
