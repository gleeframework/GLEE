"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $11,000, but still within a range where Alice might be willing to negotiate. It also leaves room for further counteroffers if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. However, it's a significant improvement from her initial offer and getting closer to my target price.  Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and I'll end up having to buy from John at $8,000.  Accepting Alice's offer at $10,000 is a good compromise and avoids that risk."
