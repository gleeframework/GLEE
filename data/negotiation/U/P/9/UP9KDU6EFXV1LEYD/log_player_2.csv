"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $10,000 from John.  There's room for negotiation with Alice, as she values the product at $8,000. Rejecting Alice's offer gives Bob the opportunity to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Offering $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $9,500, but still leaves some room for Alice to profit. This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
