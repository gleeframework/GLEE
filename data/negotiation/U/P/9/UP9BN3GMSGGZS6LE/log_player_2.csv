"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You want to save as much money as possible.  $120 is still too expensive for you.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

You want to buy the product for as low a price as possible, but it's still worth $150 to you.  Offering $100 gives you a decent margin of savings, and it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to your desired price, it's still more than you'd like to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better deal.  You have 7 rounds left, so there's time to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've already rejected Alice's offer of $130, and you're willing to pay up to $150.  Offering $110 is a compromise, showing you're serious about buying but still looking for a good price.  It's also only $10 less than Alice's last offer, which increases the likelihood she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is closer to your maximum price, but it's still $10 more than you want to pay. You have 5 rounds left, which is enough time to keep trying to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to get closer to your target price of $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate.  You've already rejected $140 and offered $110. Offering $120 is a reasonable compromise, meeting Alice halfway and potentially getting a deal before reaching your maximum price limit. You have 4 rounds left to close the deal, so it's important to be flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $145 is close to your maximum price, it's still more than you want to pay. You only have 3 rounds left, but there's still a chance to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to get closer to your target price of $110, or at least make Alice come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

You have only 2 rounds left and need to make a decision.  Alice is clearly not going to drop to your initial target price of $110, but they have shown a willingness to negotiate. Offering $130 is a compromise, but it's still lower than their last offer and puts you in a good position for the final round. If Alice accepts, you get the product for a decent price, and if they reject, you can still buy from John in the final round, which was your backup plan from the beginning."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $148. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $148
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round. You have two options:

1. **Accept Alice's offer:** This would mean paying $148, which is only slightly better than buying from John.
2. **Reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer:** This is risky. There's no guarantee Alice will accept your counteroffer, and if she rejects it, you'll be left with no deal and no chance to buy from John.

Considering the limited time and the small price difference between Alice's offer and John's price, it's more strategic to buy from John. This guarantees you get the product for a price you're comfortable with and avoids any potential risk of not closing the deal."
