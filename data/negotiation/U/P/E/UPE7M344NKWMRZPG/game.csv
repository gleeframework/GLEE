,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make at least $850,000 on this sale.  How about we split the difference and go with $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 is still not quite enough for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we settle on $825,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing you to stay within your budget and me to cover my costs.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $795,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",795000.0,Bob,6,
