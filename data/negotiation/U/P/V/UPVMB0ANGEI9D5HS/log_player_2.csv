"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. My initial offer for the product is $1000000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. Therefore, it's beneficial to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product holds for you, and it's a significant step up from your initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial $1,000,000, it's still above Bob's preferred price point. Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate and has room to lower the price further. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to counter and try to secure a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product and our previous discussions.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $980000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product holds for you, and it's a relatively small increase from your last offer. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $980,000 is still too high for Bob, despite being a relatively small increase from his previous offer. It's clear that Alice is not willing to budge much further, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, buying from John for $1,200,000, while not ideal, is a better option than accepting Alice's current offer or continuing a potentially unproductive negotiation."
