Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $1,250,000 is a significant discount from my minimum price, making it appealing to Bob. 
* **Open Communication:** The message emphasizes fairness and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation.

This approach aims to maximize my potential earnings while also encouraging Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay up to $1,100,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price ($1,500,000).**  Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** While Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, it indicates he is willing to pay more than his initial $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Selling to John is the best option if a deal with Bob cannot be reached.**  However, I don't want to rush into that decision yet.  There's a possibility that I can get a better price from Bob through further negotiation.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob, aiming to find a price that's closer to my minimum while still being appealing to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to My Minimum:** I'm increasing the price slightly from my previous offer, but still keeping it lower than my absolute minimum. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also have a firm price in mind.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** The message focuses on finding a price that benefits both of us. This approach aims to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to compromise.
* **Room for Further Compromise:**  $1,200,000 is still lower than my ideal price, leaving space for further negotiation if necessary.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation moving towards a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to pay more than his initial offer, indicating there's still room for negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a Safe Option:** While it's tempting to sell to John for $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob first. 

**Next Step:**  I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000 or higher.  My goal is to find a price that's mutually acceptable while still being profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000? This price reflects a compromise from both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Compromise:** My counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still below my previous price. This shows I'm willing to meet him halfway while still maintaining my profitability.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** The message emphasizes the compromise and mutual benefit of this price. This encourages Bob to see the offer as a fair solution.
* **Final Offer Implication:**  I'm positioning this counteroffer as a potential final offer, implying that further negotiation might not be fruitful. This puts pressure on Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties while still ensuring a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. Can we meet at $1,155,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,155,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,155,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's offer of $1,155,000 is only a small increase from his previous offer. Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price closer to my minimum.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate where neither of us is willing to compromise further.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me a significant profit ($1,500,000) and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

While I would prefer a higher price, the potential for further negotiation with Bob is limited.  Therefore, selling to John is the most sensible option to secure a significant profit and avoid the possibility of a drawn-out negotiation."
