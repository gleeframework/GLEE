Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal for something of this quality."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price slightly.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value"" and a ""fantastic deal,"" I'm framing the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying you'll list it publicly, you subtly imply that this is a limited-time offer, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. If his counter-offer is too low, don't be afraid to walk away, knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
