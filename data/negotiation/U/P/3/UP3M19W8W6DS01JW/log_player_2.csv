Alice is still a little high for my budget, but I can probably get a better deal if I keep negotiating. Let's see if we can bridge that gap."

Alice has come down to $13,250.  That's still above my ideal price, but it's getting close. It's a better deal than what John is offering, and it's worth taking.  I can always try to haggle more later if I need to."
