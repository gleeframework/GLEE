"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference at $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward with the deal.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $9,000. Let's try $9,500. It's a compromise that allows us to both walk away happy. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $9,500. I'm still thinking $9,000 is the maximum I can pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you consider $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,6,
