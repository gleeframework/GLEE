"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,500 is still a lot higher than the product's value to Alice. Rejecting the offer gives Bob the chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to Alice's value of $8,000 as possible without jeopardizing the deal.  A counteroffer of $8,500 gives Alice some room to negotiate while still providing significant savings for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice. There is still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to push for a lower price.  He's not desperate yet, so buying from John is still a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is still a good deal for Bob, especially considering he has the option of buying from John. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward without giving Alice too much leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is tempting, it's still more than what Bob is willing to pay, especially considering Alice has already rejected his counteroffer.  Bob can try to get a lower price by continuing to negotiate, as buying from John remains a viable option.  He can still save money by negotiating further, and there are still several rounds to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's offering a price slightly higher than his last offer, signaling a willingness to compromise, but still well below Alice's current price. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while leaving room for Alice to adjust her position.  Bob's goal is to reach a deal before the rounds run out.  He is aware he can always buy from John, but he wants to get the best price possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum, it's still not a good deal for him.  He's not desperate yet, and there are still a few rounds remaining. There's still a chance he can negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John is still a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  $9,500 is a good price for Bob and provides a decent profit margin for Alice.  This offer gives Alice a reason to accept before the negotiation runs out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to close a deal.  Alice's offer of $11,500 is too high for Bob, especially given that he has only one round left. Buying from John for $12,000 guarantees him the product while still staying within his budget.  There's no point in risking the deal by making another counteroffer and potentially ending up with nothing.  It's better to secure the product now rather than risk losing the chance entirely."
