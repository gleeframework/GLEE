Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still keeping Alice well above her minimum price. 
* **Strong but Fair:**  The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, aiming to make him feel like he's getting a good deal even though the price is significantly higher than Alice's minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Information Advantage:** Alice doesn't know how much Bob is willing to pay (only that it's up to $15,000). If she started too high (e.g., $14,000), she risks an immediate rejection.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net. This allows Alice to be more ambitious with her initial offer to Bob."
