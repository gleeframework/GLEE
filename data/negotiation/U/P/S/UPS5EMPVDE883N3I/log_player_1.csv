Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but the price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are still quite far apart on price.  While I believe your product is good, I can't justify going that high.  Would you consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We still have negotiating room and Bob is slowly increasing his offer. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is our safety net, but we should aim for a higher price with Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? That reflects a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated, but that price is still a bit too high for me.  I could go up to $1,000,000.  That's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has now hit his maximum price. He's unlikely to go any higher. While we could try to negotiate him up a bit, it's risky, and we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000. It's time to take the safe and profitable route."
