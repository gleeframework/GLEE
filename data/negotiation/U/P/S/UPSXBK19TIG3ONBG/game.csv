"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I have to be honest with you, I'm looking for a serious buyer who is willing to make a substantial investment. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000 for this product.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about we settle at $9,000? That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a price of $10,500. This is a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is important to both of us, but I need the price to be a bit more realistic.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting stuck in a loop. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on a price by now, I'm going to have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,7,
