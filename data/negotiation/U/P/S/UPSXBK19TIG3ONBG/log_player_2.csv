"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I have to be honest with you, I'm looking for a serious buyer who is willing to make a substantial investment. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000 for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both her valuation and my upper limit. It's worth negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Alice is coming down, but $11,000 is still too high. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if there's room for negotiation."

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a price of $10,500. This is a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting stuck in a loop. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on a price by now, I'm going to have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
