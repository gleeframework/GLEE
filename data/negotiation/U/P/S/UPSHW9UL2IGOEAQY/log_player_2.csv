It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge much further:**  She's consistently indicated that she values the product highly and is making relatively small concessions.
* **Time is a factor:** With only a few rounds left, the potential savings from haggling with Alice are diminishing compared to the risk of her not coming down enough.
* **John offers a guaranteed price:** Buying from John ensures you get the product at your target price without further negotiation or risk."
