"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This price reflects the product's worth to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair value for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a win-win situation. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
