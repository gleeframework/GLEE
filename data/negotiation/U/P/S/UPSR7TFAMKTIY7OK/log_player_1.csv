Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $15000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is a decent price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $18,000. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your position, but $15,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $16,500? I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 16500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $15,500.  While it's still a bit lower than I hoped, it's getting closer to my target and it's better than selling to John for $12,000. We're approaching the halfway point in the negotiations, and I want to close the deal before we run out of time."
