"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a good compromise for you, but I'm still not sure I'm getting the best value for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is still a concession from my original price. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this works for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
