"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is a fair reflection of its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You can get the product for a much lower price than Alice's offer ($1,300,000) by negotiating with her. 
* Buying from John for $1,500,000 is the worst option. 
* It's worthwhile to see if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  Alice's counteroffer of $1,175,000 is still higher than your ideal price, and you have room for negotiation.
*  You can likely secure a lower price by making another counteroffer. 
*  Buying from John for $1,500,000 remains the least desirable option."
