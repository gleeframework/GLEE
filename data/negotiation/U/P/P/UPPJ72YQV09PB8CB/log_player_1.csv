Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still being a fair deal for me."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, which is our guaranteed fallback with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but not ridiculously so (like $20,000) allows for potential counter-offers from Bob. 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message subtly reminds Bob of the product's value to him, increasing his willingness to pay.

By starting at $14,500, we give ourselves a good chance of:

1. **Bob Accepts:** We make a significant profit, exceeding Bob's perceived value.
2. **Bob Negotiates:** We have room to lower the price slightly and still secure a deal above our minimum.
3. **Bob Rejects:** We move to John and get our guaranteed $15,000."
