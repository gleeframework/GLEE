"Hey Alice, $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you want a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $87?  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",87.0,Bob,4,
