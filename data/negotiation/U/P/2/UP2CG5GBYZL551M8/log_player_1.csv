{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than what I'm asking. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than Bob's perceived value, but still higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $87?  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $87 is a good compromise. It's still above my minimum of $80 and closer to my desired price of $95.  At this point, I'd rather secure a sale with Bob than risk further negotiations or selling to John at a lower price."
