Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob responds before considering going lower or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,400,000. This is a compromise,  lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. I hope it will be enough to convince him to buy while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's getting risky to keep negotiating with him, and the risk of ending up with nothing is high.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000. This ensures I get at least my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
