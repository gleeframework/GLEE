"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's much wiser to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down, as she values the product at $1,200,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $1,300,000? This reflects the product's true worth and potential for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,300,000 is still outside of Bob's budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  Bob can still potentially save a significant amount of money by rejecting and making another counteroffer."
