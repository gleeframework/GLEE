"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a better price than John's $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product is truly one-of-a-kind and will bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$900,000 is a good price:**  It's a significant improvement over John's $1,000,000 price.
* **Alice is showing flexibility:**  Alice moved from $950,000 to $900,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** While Bob could try to get a lower price, there's a chance Alice will become less flexible or even end the negotiations. 

Therefore, accepting the offer at $900,000 is the most sensible choice for Bob at this point."
