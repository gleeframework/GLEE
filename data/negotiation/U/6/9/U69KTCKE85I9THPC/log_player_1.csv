{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $10,000. 
* **John as Backup:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $11,500, Alice aims to:

1. **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, but Alice has a buffer before reaching her minimum acceptable price.
2. **Highlight Value:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's worth, justifying the price.
3. **Create Urgency:** Mentioning a public listing implies others might be interested, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly."
