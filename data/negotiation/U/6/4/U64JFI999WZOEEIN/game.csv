"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's still below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the value you mentioned earlier, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your budget and the product's worth to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your budget and the product's worth to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
