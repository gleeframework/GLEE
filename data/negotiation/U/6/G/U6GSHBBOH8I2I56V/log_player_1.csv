Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price, so it's better to reject and counteroffer.  I still have time to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $7,500.  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to what I need to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 7500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $7,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have rounds left and can potentially get closer to my desired price. It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $7,250 as a final offer.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $6,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price, and I'm willing to risk losing Bob as a buyer. It's worth seeing if I can get closer to my desired price in the remaining rounds. I can always sell to John as a backup."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but I can't go any lower than $7,000. This is a fair price for the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  If you're not comfortable with this, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 7000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the value of the product, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $6,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,900

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a price close to my minimum. It's better to sell to John at $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I can't risk running out of time and ending up with a lower price than I'm comfortable with."
