"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budgetary constraints, I must respectfully decline your offer of $1000000.

"Dear Alice, thank you for your counteroffer of $1200000. I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget, and I'm willing to take on the risk of potentially missing out on the product's full value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to be mindful of my financial constraints.",900000.0,Bob,4,
