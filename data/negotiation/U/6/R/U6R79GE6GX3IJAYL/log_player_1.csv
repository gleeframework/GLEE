I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $900,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This still offers you a good profit margin and allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
