"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its potential.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. The product is too expensive, and Bob can get it for a cheaper price from John. There's no need to accept an offer that's already higher than his maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, $1000000 doesn't fully reflect the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential this product offers.  Let's find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above his desired price. He can still get the product for a cheaper price from John, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering again makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the offer, but $1,250,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in this product.  $1100000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still slightly above Bob's desired price.  Since he can buy it for $1,200,000 from John, there's no urgency to accept yet. He can counteroffer again to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer. While $1,150,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $1,125,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
