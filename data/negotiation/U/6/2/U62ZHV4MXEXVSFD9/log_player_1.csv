Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking something closer to  $800,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 3

{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still quite a gap from what I'm willing to pay.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

Bob is getting closer to our minimum, but we still have room to negotiate and time before we need to accept John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're getting closer. While $1,250,000 is appealing, I need to see a price that reflects the real value of this product.  Would you be willing to consider $1,600,000? I'm confident it's a fair deal."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000.  I feel this is a fair compromise and reflects the value I place on the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

We are still below John's offer, and while the time pressure is on, we might be able to get Bob a bit closer to $1,500,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be candid, I have another offer on the table for $1,500,000. To make this work for me, I'd need to see you at $1,450,000.  This would allow me to move forward with you knowing I'm getting a fair deal."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other offers, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  I can go up to $1,375,000, but that's my absolute limit. It's a strong offer, and I think it's fair given the other options I have available. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000

Bob is unlikely to move much higher, and any further attempts to negotiate could risk losing both deals. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
