"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested, but only if we can come down to a more reasonable price. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price of $18,000 reflects its worth. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $18,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $12,000, but that's as high as I can go.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to $15,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I could potentially do $13,000 if that works for you? It's a fair offer considering its condition and the current market.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price. To be honest, $15,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go.  It's a fantastic deal for a product of this quality.  Take it or leave it.",15000.0,Alice,7,
