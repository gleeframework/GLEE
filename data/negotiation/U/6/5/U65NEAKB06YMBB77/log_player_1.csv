"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for maximum potential profit. It also signals to Bob that I believe the product is very valuable.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving it away cheaply.

**Why I'm not selling to John yet:**

While $1,000,000 is a guaranteed return, I have a chance to earn more with Bob.  Ten rounds of negotiation give me ample opportunity to gauge his interest and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I believe I can do better.  I'm aiming for a higher price, and I'm not yet convinced Bob is willing to go that high.  I'm still hopeful about securing a better deal with Bob.

**Why I'm not selling to John yet:**

I still have eight rounds to negotiate with Bob, and $200,000 is a significant difference.  There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer but still keeping it above Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also that I still believe the product is worth more than what Bob is offering.  I'm aiming for a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not convinced he's willing to go higher. I have six rounds left, and I'm willing to risk a few more rejections to see if I can get closer to my goal. 

**Why I'm not selling to John yet:**

A $150,000 difference is still worth fighting for. I believe that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm further lowering my price to $1,300,000.  I'm  trying to signal to Bob that I'm serious about selling but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my initial expectations.  With five rounds left, I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I'm not giving up on getting a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to the price John is offering, I'm still not willing to give up. I have four rounds left, and I believe I can secure a better price than $1,050,000.  I'm still aiming for a deal that's more profitable than what John is offering.

**Why I'm not selling to John yet:**

I'm only $50,000 away from what John is offering, and with four rounds remaining, I can still potentially secure a better price with Bob. The risk of losing out on a higher price is still worth it for me at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going for a bold move here by getting closer to Bob's offer,  I'm trying to push Bob to make a final counter-offer, hopefully getting closer to my desired price. With only three rounds left, I need to strike a balance between securing a decent deal and not ending up with John's lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I was hoping for.  With only two rounds left, I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob. 

**Why I'm selling to John:**

It's time to secure a guaranteed profit. John's offer of $1,000,000 is more than acceptable at this point, especially considering the limited time and uncertainty with Bob's offers."
