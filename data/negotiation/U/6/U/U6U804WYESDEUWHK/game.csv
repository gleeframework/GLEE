"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,175,000, so I'm counteroffering at $1,137,500.",1137500.0,Alice,5,
