"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be perfect for you!  Given its features and value, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is far above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $14,000 is significantly higher than what I'm able to spend. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing that you are serious about negotiating a fair price. However, it's still within the range of your budget, leaving some room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 reflects the true value of this product, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. You can likely get a better deal with continued negotiation, so rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the best option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $9,000 for the product. This represents a fair compromise and a price I'm comfortable paying. Let's finalize the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant move towards Alice's position, demonstrating your willingness to compromise.  However, it still stays below your maximum budget, leaving room for potential further negotiations while staying within a reasonable range."
