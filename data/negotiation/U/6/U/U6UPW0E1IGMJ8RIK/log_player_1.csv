"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I am not willing to sell at such a low price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $8,500 for this product. This still gives you a good deal considering its worth to you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That's a significant jump from my last offer and puts us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While $7,250 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I would like to get. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my goal of $12,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $7,250 is closer, but I still need to make a bit more on this sale. I'm willing to go down to $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal for you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8000}
