Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, given its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a good starting point.** It's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob.** This sets a positive tone for the negotiation and encourages him to accept the offer.

**Remember:** I'm keeping John's offer ($8,000) in mind as a safety net. If Bob doesn't come close to my desired price, I can always choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer.** This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **The message emphasizes the value to both parties.** This helps build a sense of fairness and increases the chances of agreement.
* **This price is closer to my desired outcome and leaves some room for negotiation.** It's important to remember my safety net of selling to John for $8,000.

By using this strategy, I aim to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while maximizing my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,200 is only $300 lower than my last counteroffer, and it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price ($8,000).  It's likely that further negotiations won't get me much closer to my desired price, and risking a rejection could lead to me selling to John for $8,000.  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a deal that's both profitable and efficient."
