"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000, a price that I believe is a fair compromise between what I need to make and the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum and saves you money compared to buying from John."
