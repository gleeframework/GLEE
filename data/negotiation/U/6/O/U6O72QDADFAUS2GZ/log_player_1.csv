"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My starting price is $130, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $130, which is above my minimum of $100 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:**  I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm asking for Bob's thoughts, making it clear I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Could we discuss a price closer to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob acknowledges the product's value but wants a lower price. This means there's still room for negotiation.
* **Avoiding Immediate Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling at my minimum, leaving no room for profit.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $115? This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not completely meeting it, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""good deal"" for both of us, emphasizing fairness.
* **Maintaining Openness:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion, allowing for more flexibility in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Upside:**  Bob's offer is only $5 more than John's offer. There's limited potential to get a significantly higher price. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 6 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal increases.
* **Secure Profit:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit of $5, which is better than selling to John for $100."
