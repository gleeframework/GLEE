"Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. $10000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $15000.  It's still a great price for a product this valuable.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about buying this product.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $12000 just isn't enough for me. Let's meet in the middle - $13500. This gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $13500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product.",12500.0,Bob,6,
