"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to:

* **Be polite and acknowledge Alice's offer.**
* **Express interest in the product but frame the price as a sticking point.**
* **Start with a significantly lower offer ($80) to leave room for negotiation while staying well below my $100 maximum.**"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

```

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our target price. Let's keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $100? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Acknowledgment:**  We recognize Alice's compromise (""appreciate you meeting me halfway"").
* **Firmness:** We state our target price ($100) as our ""final offer"" to signal we're unlikely to go higher. 
* **Directness:** We cut to the chase, keeping the negotiation moving.

Now, Alice has a clear choice: accept our $100, try to negotiate further, or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $140. It's the lowest I can go and still make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $140, and we've already stated our firm limit of $100.  We have a guaranteed option with John at that price, so it's the best choice to maximize our savings."
