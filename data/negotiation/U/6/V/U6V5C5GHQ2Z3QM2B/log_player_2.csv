Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going below $87. It's my minimum price, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle at $83? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $83. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $83
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is holding firm around the $80 mark. While I might be able to haggle her down another dollar or two, it's unlikely to be a significant difference. Accepting at $83 is a reasonable compromise and avoids the risk of the deal falling through entirely."
