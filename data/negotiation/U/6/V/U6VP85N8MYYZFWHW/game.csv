"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $90. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Alice,3,

"I understand your desire to stay under $85, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. How about we try $88? It's a small increase from our previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",88.0,Alice,5,
