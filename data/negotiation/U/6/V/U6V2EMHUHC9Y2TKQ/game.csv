"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be happy to pay $75 for it. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $82. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $78.  If that's not workable, I'll have to go with John's offer.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $78, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $80.50. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",80.5,Alice,5,
