"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still negotiating! I'm not quite ready to accept $11,000, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $12,500. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum price. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
