"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $10,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still higher than Bob's preferred price. While it's closer than her initial offer, Bob can still potentially negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there yet at $10,500. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. I've got to make sure I'm getting the best possible price for this product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice's offer is the best option for Bob. While it's higher than his ideal price, it's still significantly lower than John's offer.  Furthermore, the negotiations have been going on for a few rounds, and there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further.  Accepting the offer at $11,000 secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing out on the deal altogether."
