Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're really close now, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but I need a bit more assurance that we can finalize the deal. I'll offer you a slight concession: I'll throw in a small warranty and support package, which is worth an additional $10,000. So, I'm offering the product to you for $1,130,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is offering a good price with the warranty and support package, but you are only one round away from having to buy from John.  It's a tough decision, but with just one round left, the risk of not being able to negotiate further is too great. John is a safe bet at this point."
