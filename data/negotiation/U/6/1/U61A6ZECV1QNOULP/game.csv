"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $10,500 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $10,500.
