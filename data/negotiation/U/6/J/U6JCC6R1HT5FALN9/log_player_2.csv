"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's offer:** $11,000 is too high, Bob can likely get a better price.
* **Buying from John:**  While John's offer is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, it's still more expensive than what Bob could potentially negotiate with Alice.

**Next Steps:** Bob should make a counteroffer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'd be interested in buying the product for $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her minimum acceptable price. This establishes a negotiating range.
* **Rationale:**  Bob wants to test the waters and see how much Alice is willing to budge. 
* **Next Steps:**  Alice will either accept Bob's counteroffer, reject it and make a new counteroffer, or Bob will need to decide whether to move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $9,500. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Still to save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $10,250 is closer to Bob's desired price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Buying from John:**  John's offer is more expensive than Alice's current offer.

**Next Steps:**  Bob should counteroffer again to see if he can get a lower price.  He's already shown willingness to negotiate, and Alice has signaled she's open to lowering her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $10,000?  That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Bob is slowly inching closer to Alice's offer, demonstrating he is serious about buying but still trying to get a better deal. 
* **Rationale:**  $10,000 is a compromise that's closer to Alice's price, but still within Bob's budget and likely acceptable to her. 
* **Next Steps:**  Alice will either accept Bob's counteroffer, reject it and make a new counteroffer, or Bob will need to decide whether to move on to John."
