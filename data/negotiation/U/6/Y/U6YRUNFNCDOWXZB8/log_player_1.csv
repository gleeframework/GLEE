Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you're interested in. I'm happy to offer it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $95, which is closer to my minimum value of $100. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and open to negotiation, aiming to keep Bob engaged.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I'm aware that John is a guaranteed sale at $100, so I won't go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, he's shown interest in the product and is willing to negotiate. This means there's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's Offer:**  John offers a guaranteed $100, so I can afford to be firm with Bob and aim for a higher price. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and propose a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget of $80. While that's a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $80. This shows a willingness to compromise and makes the negotiation feel more collaborative.
* **Highlighting the Compromise:** My message explicitly points out that I'm offering a lower price than before, reinforcing the idea that I'm trying to work with Bob's budget. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language like ""fair"" and ""both of us"" to keep the conversation friendly and encouraging.

By offering a counter-price that's closer to Bob's offer, I'm increasing the chances of him accepting while still staying above my minimum price."
