"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $15,000, which is significantly above my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to make Bob feel valued and encourage him to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I'm asking for Bob's thoughts to encourage him to respond and potentially counteroffer, giving me more information about his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.** While it's closer to my desired price, it's not enough to warrant a sale. I'm hoping to squeeze out a few more thousand dollars.
* **Negotiation is still possible.**  Bob expressed genuine interest, so I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price with a few more rounds of negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a last resort.** While $10,000 is a guaranteed sale, I'm determined to get a better price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $12,000 is tempting, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair compromise and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and how it's a ""fair compromise."" 
* **Positive and Engaging Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging to maintain a positive relationship with Bob and keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $12750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $12,750 is still below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm not willing to accept a price that doesn't at least meet my minimum.
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:** Bob is clearly interested, and we're both moving closer to a deal. I believe we can still find a price that works for both of us.
* **John is a Safety Net:** While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I can always turn to John for a guaranteed $10,000. However, I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement with Bob before I have to go that route."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from. How about we split the difference one more time?  $13,125. It's a fair compromise and I'm confident you won't regret it. "", ""product_price"": 13125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the Compromise:** I'm sticking to the ""meet in the middle"" approach, which keeps the negotiation moving.
* **Fairness Appeal:** Emphasizing ""fair compromise"" reinforces that I'm flexible and eager to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Positive Reinforcement:**  I'm still positive and encouraging to keep Bob engaged and interested in making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $12000. How about we meet at $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the Minimum:** $13,000 finally meets my minimum value for the product.  I'm not willing to let the negotiation drag on further if we're this close to an agreeable price.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:**  Although it's at my minimum, there's still a chance Bob might offer more if I reject. However, the risk of him walking away completely or not being able to secure a higher offer is too high.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  This is a guaranteed profit, and while I'd prefer more, I'm satisfied with securing a sale that meets my minimum requirement."
