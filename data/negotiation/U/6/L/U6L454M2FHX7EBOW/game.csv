"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! I understand that $850000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm happy to see you're willing to work with me.  However, $1050000 is still a bit too high. I'm  prepared to pay $900000.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value of this product.  Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $950000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand this is your final offer, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's find a way to make this work.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $950000, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925000 and $950000. I'm now offering the product to you for $937500. This is my last concession, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",937500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $937500 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get it down to $900000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's work together to close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already made several concessions, Bob, and I'm not willing to go back to $900000. I'm willing to make one more offer that's close to the middle, but I need to meet my minimum. I'm now offering the product to you for $980000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can understand my position.",980000.0,Alice,9,
