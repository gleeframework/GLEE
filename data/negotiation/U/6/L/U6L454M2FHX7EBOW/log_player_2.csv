Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already made several concessions, Bob, and I'm not willing to go back to $900000. I'm willing to make one more offer that's close to the middle, but I need to meet my minimum.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer of $980,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. With only one round left, it's not likely you'll be able to negotiate her down further.  It's more advantageous to buy the product from John at a fixed price of $800,000 and save yourself the risk of a failed negotiation."
