Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, let's try to wrap this up.  I can do $7,750, and I think that's a fair compromise.  What do you think?

Bob is unlikely to go much higher and we are running out of rounds. It's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John than risk Bob walking away in the end."
