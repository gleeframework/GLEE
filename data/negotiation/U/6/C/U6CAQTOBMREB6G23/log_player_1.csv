Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $80, so $110 is a price he might consider. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You're willing to accept no less than $120, but starting lower allows for negotiation space.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly, but still be above your minimum. 

By starting with a slightly lower price, you encourage Bob to negotiate, increasing the chances of a successful transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $120.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. That's still a great price for a product of this quality. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $100 is a bit higher than my initial target, but I'm still interested in the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your target. You have a guaranteed buyer in John, and the negotiation with Bob isn't moving quickly enough.  Rejecting Bob's offer and making another counteroffer is risky, so selling to John is the most logical choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.  Let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 102.5} 
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, trying to bridge the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer. It also signals that you are nearing your limit and might be willing to sell to John."
