"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $12,000 to you, right? I'm offering it to you for $13,500.  This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price you're comfortable with, and I get a good price without having to go through the hassle of selling to someone else. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,1,
