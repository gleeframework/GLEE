"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $12,000 to you, right? I'm offering it to you for $13,500.  This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price you're comfortable with, and I get a good price without having to go through the hassle of selling to someone else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* You are willing to pay a maximum of $12,000.
* Alice is offering the product for $13,500.
* You can get the same product from John for $12,000.

Therefore, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John."
