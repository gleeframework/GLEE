"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. However, I would like to counter with an offer of $1,350,000 for the product. This price aligns better with my budget while still allowing for a reasonable investment. I look forward to your response.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This offer still allows for a healthy profit for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
