"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's fair considering your own value for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a fair deal, Bob, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
