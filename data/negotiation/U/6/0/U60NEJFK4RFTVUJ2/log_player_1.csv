Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with my ideal price, as I'm confident the product is worth that much to me. This gives Bob room to negotiate if he's genuinely interested. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and weigh it against selling to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. While I could sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm offering Bob a price that's closer to his offer, but still significantly higher than his initial proposal. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product highly. Hopefully, this counteroffer will encourage further negotiation and lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer is still far below what the product is worth to me. Considering that I can sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000, it makes more sense to secure that deal.  The risk of further negotiation with Bob doesn't seem worth the potential loss of earnings."
