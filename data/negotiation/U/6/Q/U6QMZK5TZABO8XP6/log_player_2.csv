**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay from John. I want to see if I can get a better deal from Alice.  There's potential to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is the best I can do at the moment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still hesitant to commit. There's still room to negotiate, and I don't want to rush into a deal that might not be the most beneficial for me.  I'll counteroffer again and see if I can get closer to my target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already come down significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price and has stated this is her final offer. While I would love to get it for closer to $1,150,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John for a much higher price. Accepting her offer saves me $250,000 compared to buying from John."
