"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  This is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see a strong return.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since you know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice.  A counteroffer gives you a chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value you place on it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, reflecting the value this product brings. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but it's still above your target.  You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better deal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is fair considering the value you place on the product and allows you to meet your minimum.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is your final offer. It's at your maximum budget, but also at Alice's minimum. This should create a strong incentive for Alice to accept. You're highlighting the benefits to both parties, aiming to close the deal and avoid potentially going to John."
