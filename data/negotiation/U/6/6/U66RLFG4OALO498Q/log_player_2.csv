It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price, especially since you have a backup option.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $900,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

Alice's offer of $925,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to my counteroffer.  Buying from her at this price saves me $75,000 compared to buying from John."
