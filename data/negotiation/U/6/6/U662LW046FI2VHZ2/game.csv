"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This would still represent a significant profit for you, and allows me to secure a better deal.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price point.  While your initial offer is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to move slightly from my original ask. Would you consider $900,000? This price reflects the product's true value and ensures a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $875,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit and me to secure a valuable product at a reasonable cost.",875000.0,Bob,4,
