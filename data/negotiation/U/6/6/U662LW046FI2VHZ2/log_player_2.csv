Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price point.  While your initial offer is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to move slightly from my original ask. Would you consider $900,000? This price reflects the product's true value and ensures a mutually beneficial agreement.
