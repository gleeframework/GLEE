"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $150, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $150 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $135? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",135.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's close this deal at $142.50.  That's a good price for both of us.",142.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $142.50 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $130. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",130.0,Bob,6,
