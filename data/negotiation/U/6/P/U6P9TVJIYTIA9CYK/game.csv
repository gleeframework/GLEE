"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $10000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10000. This is still a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's as high as I can go. Is there any flexibility on your end?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $9000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering its value to me is at least $10000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $9500 is too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you consider this final offer?",9000.0,Bob,6,
