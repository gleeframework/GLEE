Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value, leaving room for negotiation. It's important to be aggressive in the initial offer to potentially secure a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell below my value yet. I'll try to counter-offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $12,500, splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum value."
