Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  I'm asking $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($100) to give me some room to negotiate.  I'm confident I can get at least $100 from John, so I'm willing to risk losing this deal if Bob isn't willing to pay at least that much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering $95, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'm tempted to continue negotiating, I'm confident I can get a better deal with John.  It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $100 sale."
