"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm confident it's worth at least $1200000 to me, and I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm sure you'll see the potential. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While she claims the product is worth $1,200,000 to her, that information doesn't change your own valuation. You're better off rejecting her offer and buying from John for $1,000,000."
