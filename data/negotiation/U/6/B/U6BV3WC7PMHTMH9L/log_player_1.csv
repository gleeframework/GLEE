Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefit it will bring to you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), I start with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The offer leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the ""significant benefit,"" I aim to emphasize the product's value and justify the high price. 
* **Backup plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will purchase it for my minimum acceptable price."
