Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is considerably less than what I can accept.  This product has significant inherent value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with less."
