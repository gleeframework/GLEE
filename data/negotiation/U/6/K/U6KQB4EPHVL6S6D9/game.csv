"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is considerably less than what I can accept.  This product has significant inherent value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this deal work.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
