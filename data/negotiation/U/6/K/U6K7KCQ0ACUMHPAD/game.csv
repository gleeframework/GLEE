"I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $90? It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can agree on something.",90.0,Bob,2,,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $105 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and it saves us both the time and hassle of going back and forth.",100.0,Bob,4,,

I'm not quite ready to give up on the extra $10 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $110?,110.0,Alice,5,,
