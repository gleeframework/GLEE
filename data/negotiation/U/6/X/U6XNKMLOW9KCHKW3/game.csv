"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $2000000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid $1250000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1750000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $1400000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1400000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about my bottom line. How about we meet at $1600000? I think that's a more reasonable price for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
