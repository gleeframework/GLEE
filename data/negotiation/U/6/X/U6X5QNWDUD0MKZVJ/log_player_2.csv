"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering it for $140. This is closer to your limit but not the best deal.
* **John's offer is your backup.** If you reject Alice's offer, you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $150, which is your maximum. 
* **Negotiating with Alice:** You could try to counter-offer Alice with a lower price (maybe $135), but there's no guarantee she'll accept.  Since you have a backup option, there's no pressure to accept her first offer."
