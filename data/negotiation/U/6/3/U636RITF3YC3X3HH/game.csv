"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while allowing for a comfortable margin for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm confident that this product will generate significant returns for you, even beyond the $1,500,000 you value it at.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,250,000. I'm confident this price is fair and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
