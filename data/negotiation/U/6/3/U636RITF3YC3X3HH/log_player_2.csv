"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

You can do better than $1,400,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm confident that this product will generate significant returns for you, even beyond the $1,500,000 you value it at.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.

You can still do better than $1,300,000.  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $1,000,000. There's room to negotiate a lower price."
