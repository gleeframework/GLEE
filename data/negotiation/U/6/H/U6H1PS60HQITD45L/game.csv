"Bob, I have a truly unique product that I believe will be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you first, but I'm confident it will be snapped up quickly. My asking price is $1500000.

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't justify that price at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the potential value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1000000 is a fair price for the product, I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1250000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1250000 is closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price to make it work.  Would you be willing to go down to $1150000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that you've already lowered your initial offer.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1200000? This price is a fair compromise, reflecting both the product's value and your budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
