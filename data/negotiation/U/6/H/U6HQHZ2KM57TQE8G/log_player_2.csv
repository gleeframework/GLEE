Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $105. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $100. It's in your best interest to cut your losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $100 price."
