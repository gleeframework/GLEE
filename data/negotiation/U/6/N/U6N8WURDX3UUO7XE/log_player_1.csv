Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is more than $10,000, so Bob might be willing to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** $12,000 is lower than your minimum of $15,000, leaving room for potential negotiations. 

By starting with a reasonable offer and leaving space for negotiations, you increase your chances of closing the deal while still getting a good price. Remember, you can always choose to stop negotiations and sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  It's well below my minimum of $15,000 and even significantly lower than the initial offer I made. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, as it's lower than my initial offer, and it's closer to your perceived value. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
