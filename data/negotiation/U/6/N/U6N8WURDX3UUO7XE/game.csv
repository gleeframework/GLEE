"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, as it's lower than my initial offer, and it's closer to your perceived value. Let me know if this works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the last offer I can make. Let me know if you're interested.",11500.0,Alice,5,
