"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
