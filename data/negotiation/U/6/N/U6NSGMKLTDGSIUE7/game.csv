"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1000000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  To start our negotiations, I'm offering it to you for $950000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000. I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $900000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm proposing a price of $925000. This leaves room for both of us to gain from this deal.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $920000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $915000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",915000.0,Bob,4,
