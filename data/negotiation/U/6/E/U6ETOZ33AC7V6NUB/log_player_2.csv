"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $15000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $8000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's not a good deal for you.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is closer to your budget than $15,000, it's still higher than your ideal price point.  You should reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price, potentially splitting the difference between $8,000 and $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair deal considering the value I place on the product. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still higher than your ideal price.  While you could continue negotiating, it's likely that you'll need to continue splitting the difference, and the negotiations could go on for a while.  Since John is offering the product for your ideal price of $8,000, it makes sense to end the negotiation with Alice and buy the product from John."
