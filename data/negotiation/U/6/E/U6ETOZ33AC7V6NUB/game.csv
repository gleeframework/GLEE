"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $12000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair deal considering the value I place on the product. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
