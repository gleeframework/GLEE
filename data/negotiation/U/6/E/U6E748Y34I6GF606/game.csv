"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for both of us to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This gives you a good deal, and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  This offer gives you a significant profit and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still not enough for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $925,000. This is a good deal for both of us and ensures we both make a profit. It's time to finalize this, as I have other potential buyers waiting in the wings.",925000.0,Alice,5,
