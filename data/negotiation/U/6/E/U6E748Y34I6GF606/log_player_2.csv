"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth negotiating further to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This gives you a good deal, and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than what Bob is willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down to a price closer to Bob's budget."

I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  This offer gives you a significant profit and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still not enough for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $925,000. This is a good deal for both of us and ensures we both make a profit. It's time to finalize this, as I have other potential buyers waiting in the wings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's budget. While a further counteroffer might be possible, the risk of Alice walking away or making a counteroffer that is still too high is a real possibility.  At this point, the certainty of getting the product from John for $800,000 is the most sensible option for Bob."
