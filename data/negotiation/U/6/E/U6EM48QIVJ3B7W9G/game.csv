"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This price still offers you a significant savings, and it's a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could you do $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $7,500 just won't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is a great price for both of us. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal!",8000.0,Alice,5,
