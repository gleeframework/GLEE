Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $175, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, but I'm still aiming to get as close to my minimum price as possible. 
* **Knowing John:**  I'm aware that I have another buyer (John) willing to pay $150, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $125 is significantly below my minimum price of $150. Accepting this offer would mean losing money.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a price closer to my minimum. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is a guaranteed $150, I'm hoping to get more by negotiating with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**  I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. I'm willing to come down to $140 for the product, but unfortunately, I can't go any lower.  It's a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $175 to $140. 
* **Firm but Friendly:** I'm indicating that this is my best offer, but I'm doing so in a friendly way to maintain a positive negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, even at $140.
* **Balancing Act:** I'm trying to find a balance between getting the best possible price and not pushing Bob away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However, I still feel that $125 would be a fair price for both of us. I hope you can consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Persistence:** Bob has remained firm at $125, which is significantly below my minimum price.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate, where we might never reach an agreement. 
* **John's Guarantee:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is above my minimum and avoids the risk of a prolonged and potentially unsuccessful negotiation with Bob. 

**Conclusion:**  While I would prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, John's guaranteed offer provides a secure and profitable solution."
