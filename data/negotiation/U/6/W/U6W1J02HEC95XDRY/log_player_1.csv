Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm confident will help you achieve [mention a specific benefit or goal relevant to Bob].  I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This price is a fair reflection of its worth, and I believe it represents a significant opportunity for you.  Let me know what you think. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $1,000,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** 
    *  It highlights the value of the product for Bob, not just to Alice. This makes it more appealing.
    *  It provides a reason for the price, making it seem more justifiable.
    *  It's open-ended, inviting further conversation and negotiation.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize Profit:** $1,000,000 is a significant profit for Alice.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Alice can potentially negotiate up to $1,200,000 if Bob is highly motivated.
* **Backup Plan:**  Even if Bob rejects, Alice has a secure fallback with John."
