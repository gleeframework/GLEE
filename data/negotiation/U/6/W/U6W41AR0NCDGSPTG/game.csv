"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident this product will bring you much more value than $1,000,000 in the long run. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price that reflects its true worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I've given this some thought, Alice. While I understand the value you place on the product, I still feel that $1,000,000 is the maximum I can realistically allocate for this purchase. Can we meet somewhere closer to this figure?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand you have a limit. To be fair, I also have a bottom line. Would you be willing to consider $1,025,000? This would be a win-win, allowing me to feel good about the deal while still giving you a significant return on your investment.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
