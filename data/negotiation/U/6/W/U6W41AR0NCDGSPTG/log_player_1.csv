Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your operations, even more so than my own.  Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. My budget allows me to spend up to $1,000,000 on this purchase. Would you consider adjusting your offer accordingly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:While Bob's offer is good, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. Selling to John would be a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident this product will bring you much more value than $1,000,000 in the long run. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given this some thought, Alice. While I understand the value you place on the product, I still feel that $1,000,000 is the maximum I can realistically allocate for this purchase. Can we meet somewhere closer to this figure? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  While $975,000 is getting closer to acceptable, Bob's message indicates he has room to move. I believe holding firm for one more round could result in a better offer, closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand you have a limit. To be fair, I also have a bottom line. Would you be willing to consider $1,025,000? This would be a win-win, allowing me to feel good about the deal while still giving you a significant return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've reviewed our previous discussions and am willing to increase my offer to $987,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason:  Bob is clearly trying to meet in the middle and has increased his offer significantly.  While I might be able to push for a little more, accepting $987,500 guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or stalling negotiations further."
