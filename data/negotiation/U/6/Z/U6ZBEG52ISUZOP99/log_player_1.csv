I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

I'm going to lower my price slightly to 155. This is close to my minimum, and if Bob rejects it, I'll probably sell to John."

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's still a bit below my desired price, it's getting close to my minimum and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round. It's better to secure the deal than risk losing out."
