Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. It's a fair price considering my minimum is $150, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good deal.  I want to see if he's willing to come up a bit, but I'm also prepared to accept John's offer of $150 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to sell at $95, it's significantly less than my minimum of $150 and even lower than what John is offering. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $115. This is a compromise, but it still leaves me with a profit margin. I believe this is a reasonable price considering Bob's initial offer, and it may be enough to entice him to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $100 is a better offer from Bob than his previous one, it's still not enough for me. I'm better off selling to John for $150, which is my minimum price and guarantees me a good profit.  The negotiation with Bob is dragging on, and there's no guarantee he'll ever come close to my desired price.  It's time to move on and secure the deal with John."
