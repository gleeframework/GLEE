Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $150 asking price represents a 25% markup from your minimum acceptable price. This is a reasonable starting point in negotiations. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to negotiate if the $150 price is slightly too high for him. 
 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's willingness to pay beyond the $120 value it holds for him. If you had more information, you might adjust your offer accordingly."
