"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to compromise and offer $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
