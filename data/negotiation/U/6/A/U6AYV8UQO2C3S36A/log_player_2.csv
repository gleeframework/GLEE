It's too expensive.  Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."

I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. That's a significant discount from her initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price."

I'm willing to go up to $140, which is still a fair price for both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this round."
