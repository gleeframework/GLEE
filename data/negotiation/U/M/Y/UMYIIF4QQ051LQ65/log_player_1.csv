Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, aiming to get the highest possible return.  I'm aware Bob might reject this, but I'm confident he'll counter-offer, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still below what I'd ideally want. I'm willing to see if I can get a better price by counter-offering.  There's still potential for a higher deal with Bob, and I don't want to settle too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $13,500. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. My goal is to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal without having to go through more rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than what I was hoping for, but it's still above my minimum.  Considering the possibility of further negotiation going on forever, and the potential for a lower offer in the future, it's better to accept Bob's offer. Selling to John would result in a lower profit, so this is the best option at this time."
