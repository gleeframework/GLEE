"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,100,000? That's a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
