Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to go down to $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $120 to $110.  This is a good deal for Bob considering his maximum budget is $120.  While further negotiation is possible, it is likely that Alice will not drop the price further.  Accepting the offer ensures a successful purchase within Bob's budget."
