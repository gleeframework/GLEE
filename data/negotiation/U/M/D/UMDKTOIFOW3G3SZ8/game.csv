"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $7,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
