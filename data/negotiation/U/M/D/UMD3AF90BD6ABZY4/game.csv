"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While that price doesn't fully reflect the product's value, I'm willing to move closer to your number. How about we settle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $975,000, which is closer to my initial offer and represents a fair value for the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
