Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe it's a fair offer considering the return you'll get on your investment. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your absolute bottom line ($12,000). This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a price that's beneficial.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value"" and ""return on investment,"" you're framing the product's worth in a way that resonates with a potential buyer, even if they only value it at $8,000.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest. If he flat-out rejects it, you haven't lost anything because you have John as a backup. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone implies willingness to negotiate. If Bob counters, you have the flexibility to decrease the price (within reason) and still make a profit."
