"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $100, but $95 is still a significant amount more than what the product is worth to you.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  Knowing you can buy the product from John for $100 gives you leverage in the negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  A counteroffer of $85 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for compromise.
* **Value for Alice:**  This price is still above what the product is worth to Alice ($80), giving her some incentive to accept.
* **Leverage:**  You're demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while also highlighting that you're not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  While $92 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your target price.
* **More negotiation room:**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so there's potential to push for a lower price.
* **John remains an option:**  You haven't lost your safety net, so you're not in a rush to accept a suboptimal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Meeting halfway:**  It's also a bit lower than Alice's latest offer, suggesting a willingness to split the difference.
* **Maintain leverage:**  You're still below your target price, keeping John's offer as a backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While $90 is a significant drop from Alice's earlier offers, it's still more than your target price. 
* **Getting close:** Alice is clearly motivated to make a deal and her offers are getting closer to your price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Rejecting allows you to try and push for a lower price. John's offer is still a good fallback if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:**  This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, but gets you very close to Alice's last offer. It shows you're willing to compromise and close the deal.
* **Value for Alice:**  $89 is still above what the product is worth to Alice, making it a good deal for her.
* **Negotiation pressure:**  By offering a price just below Alice's last offer, you're putting pressure on her to accept and finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** $91 is only $1 more than your last offer and very close to your maximum price. 
* **Time is running out:** With only 3 rounds left, it's risky to continue negotiating. 
* **John's offer is a backup:** If this deal falls through, you can still buy from John for $100.

By accepting Alice's offer, you secure the product at a reasonable price while avoiding the risk of losing the deal or having to buy from John at a higher price."
