# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  While $110 is more than the product is worth to Alice, it's still less than the $120 you'd pay John.
* **Maximizing savings:** By accepting Alice's offer, you save $10 compared to buying from John."
