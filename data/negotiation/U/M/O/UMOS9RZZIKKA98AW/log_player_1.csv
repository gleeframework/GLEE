Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you're in a strong position. Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the product is worth more to Bob, it implies added value by mentioning ""worth and potential."" This opens the door for Bob to justify the higher price to himself.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The fact that you have John waiting in the wings isn't explicitly stated. This keeps your negotiating position stronger. You don't want to appear desperate to sell quickly."
