"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm happy to offer it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a slightly higher price than I would ideally like. This is to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer in John, who is willing to pay $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm trying to find a price that's fair for both of us. $100 is a good middle ground and is still higher than what John would pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $92 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $96.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 96}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway to see if we can reach an agreement. $96 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident that we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $96 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $94 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $94
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $94. This is a good outcome as it's closer to my minimum price of $100 and better than selling to John for $100.  I've also been able to successfully negotiate with Bob, which is a good skill to practice!"
