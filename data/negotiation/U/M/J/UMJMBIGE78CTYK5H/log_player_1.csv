Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Incentive:**  Highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect puts pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters, but ensures I don't immediately drop to his perceived value.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I have the option to counter or move on to John, who guarantees my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount you've provided. However, I am only able to pay up to $1100000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).**  While it's closer, I'm not willing to compromise that much.
* **Selling to John is still a better option.** John guarantees me my desired price.
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my target.**  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to push Bob higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not fully accepting it. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not desperate. 
* **Maintaining my leverage:**  $1,150,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, and closer to John's offer, so I have a fallback option if Bob rejects.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize ""fair compromise"" and ""happy"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1125000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.** While it's only $25,000 less than my last offer, I'm not willing to risk losing out on the guaranteed higher price from John.
* **The negotiation is becoming tedious.**  We're now in a back-and-forth that's likely to continue for a while, with diminishing returns.
* **John's offer is a secure deal.** Selling to John will save me time and stress, and ensure I get the best possible price.  

It's time to take the sure thing and move on to John!"
