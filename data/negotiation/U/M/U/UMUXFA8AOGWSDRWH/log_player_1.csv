"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer is lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a decent price. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

I'll try to get closer to my minimum price of $80. I'll offer Bob the product for $82.
