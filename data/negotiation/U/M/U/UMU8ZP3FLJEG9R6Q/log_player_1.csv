"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. I want to see if I can push for a better deal before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $15,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down slightly to $17,500 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $17500 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16000, which is a good compromise. Let's see if we can agree on that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 less than my last counteroffer and is getting closer to my desired price.  Considering that I have limited rounds and John is willing to pay my minimum, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice at this point. There's a good chance that I won't be able to push for a higher price in the remaining rounds."
