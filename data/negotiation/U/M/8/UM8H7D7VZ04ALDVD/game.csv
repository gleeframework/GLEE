"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows for a decent profit for you.  Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product for $10,250. This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows you to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this happen.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $10,300. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.",10300.0,Alice,7,
