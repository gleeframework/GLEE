Let's negotiate! Alice's offer is quite high.  I'll start with a counteroffer significantly lower to see how much room we have to bargain."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm motivated to sell, $8,500 is quite a bit below what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?

We're getting closer, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to nudge the price down a bit further."
