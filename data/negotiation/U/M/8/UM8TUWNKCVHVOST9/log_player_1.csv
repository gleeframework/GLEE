Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($100).
* **Leaving Room for Bob to Benefit:** Offering the product at $115 allows Bob to still gain a $5 surplus ($120 - $115), making the deal attractive to him.
* **Maximizing Your Profit:** This price point gets you very close to the maximum you can potentially get from Bob, maximizing your profit compared to selling to John. 

By starting the negotiation slightly below Bob's maximum valuation, you increase the chances of a quick and successful sale."
