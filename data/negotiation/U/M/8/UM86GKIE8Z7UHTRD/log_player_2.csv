Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $9,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm counteroffering $8,500 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, she is unlikely to go below $8,000.  You already have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000. It makes no sense to risk further negotiation for a potentially insignificant saving.  Buying from John guarantees you the best price you're willing to pay."
