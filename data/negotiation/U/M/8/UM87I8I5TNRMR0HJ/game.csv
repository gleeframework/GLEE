"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your perspective, Bob, but I'm afraid $900000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm now offering the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $1500000, but I'm willing to make a deal with you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $980000. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1500000.",980000.0,Alice,5,
