Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll love.  I'm asking $125 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It also encourages Bob to counter with his own offer.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further or sell to John if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm happy to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for my minimum price. I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $115?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given this some thought and I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110 for the product. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$110 is a good compromise. It's more than my minimum and it's likely the best I'll get from Bob.  I'm not willing to risk a longer negotiation and potentially lose the sale to John."
