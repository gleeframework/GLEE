"I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000 for the product. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"You're getting closer, Alice. How about $800,000? That feels like a fair price to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $800,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $920,000? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're almost there. I'm willing to increase my offer to $850,000.  Let's make this deal happen!",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and my target price. How about $1,050,000? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, that's a big jump from our previous discussions. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but that's my final offer.  Take it or leave it.",875000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below my target price. Considering we've been negotiating for a while, I'm willing to make one last counteroffer. How about $1,100,000? It's a bit above your offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,9,
