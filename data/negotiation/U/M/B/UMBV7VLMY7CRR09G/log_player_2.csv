Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below my target price. Considering we've been negotiating for a while, I'm willing to make one last counteroffer. How about $1,100,000? It's a bit above your offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $1,200,000 than to risk a worse deal with Alice in the final round."
