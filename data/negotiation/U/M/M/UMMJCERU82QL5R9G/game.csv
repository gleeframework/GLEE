"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $8,500? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's try to find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That feels like a reasonable compromise to me.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $8,250.  I'm feeling flexible, and this price is a good middle ground for us both.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  What if we split the difference again and settle on $8,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,6,
