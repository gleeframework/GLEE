Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message invites a response, giving you room to potentially negotiate down to a price still higher than John's offer.

By starting high, you maximize your chances of either:

* **Bob accepting:**  Resulting in a profit above your minimum.
* **Negotiating:** Potentially settling on a price still favorable to you.

If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at your guaranteed price."
