"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $1,000,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most rational choice for Bob."
