"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I have to be mindful of my budget. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider $18,000.  It's a compromise, but reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $14,000. Can we meet in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,4,
