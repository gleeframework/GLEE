Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know you've been eyeing it, and I believe its value aligns perfectly with your needs. I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer waiting."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have room to start high. Aiming for $1,500,000 gives you a significant potential profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, making Bob more likely to act quickly.
* **Justification of Value:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to Bob, the message implies you understand its value to him, making the price seem more reasonable. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy.  A more complex strategy might involve multiple offers and counter-offers."
