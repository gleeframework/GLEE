"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know you've been eyeing it, and I believe its value aligns perfectly with your needs. I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer waiting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and the price John is offering. It makes no sense to accept Alice's offer in this scenario."
