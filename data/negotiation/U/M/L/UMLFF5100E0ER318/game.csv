"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, I'm looking to invest a bit less. Would you be willing to consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I can't accept it. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, and I'm open to further negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $950,000? I think that's a fair reflection of its value.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
