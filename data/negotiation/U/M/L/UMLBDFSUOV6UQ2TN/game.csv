"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the introductory price,  $1200000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, recognizing its value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of that, I am proposing a counteroffer of $1100000 for the product. This is higher than your proposed price but still below the product's true value. I hope this will be more suitable for your financial planning while still providing a good return for us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1100000 is closer, but it's still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1050000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
