"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand that $100 is a bit steep, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $95.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about $88? That's a fair price.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $88. I'm willing to compromise further and sell it to you for $92.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal.  How about we split the difference and settle at $90?",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the idea of splitting the difference, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92 and $90, which would be $91.50. Would you be willing to meet me there?",91.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  Tell you what, let's make it a clean $90 even and call it a deal.",90.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to give in just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $91. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",91.0,Alice,9,
