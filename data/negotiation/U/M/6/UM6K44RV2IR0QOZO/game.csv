"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great starting point. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter. Would you be willing to consider a price of $700000? I believe this is still a fair price for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of 700000. Considering the product's value and your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for 725000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable.",725000.0,Alice,3,
