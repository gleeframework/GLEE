I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but I'm hoping to leave room for negotiation and maximize my profit. I'll closely observe Bob's response to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm not happy with Bob's lowball offer, I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll need to carefully consider a price that's both attractive to Bob and still profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm making a counteroffer of $1,750,000.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his initial offer and my initial asking price.  It's still a good profit for me, while hopefully being enticing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price and a good profit for me.  I'll accept his offer and avoid risking further negotiations."
