"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $11000. I believe this is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9800. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is lower than its value to you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",9800.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $12000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm proposing a new price of $10500. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm thinking $10250 is a more reasonable price for me. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is lower than its value to you.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10250. Considering the product's value to me is $12000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a new price of $10750. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm thinking $10375 is a more reasonable price for me. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is lower than its value to you.",10375.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to compromise, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but no higher. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is lower than its value to you. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",10500.0,Bob,10,
