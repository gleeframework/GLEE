Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This allows for a mutually beneficial agreement, and I'm confident this product will bring you significant value. Let's find common ground.
