"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This allows for a mutually beneficial agreement, and I'm confident this product will bring you significant value. Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $1050000 / 2 = $600000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
