Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is worth a great deal to both of us. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects its value and allows for a profitable deal for both parties. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I emphasize the product's value to both of us.  This helps Bob understand that the price is justified.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message uses a positive and encouraging tone, hoping to create a collaborative atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  The message doesn't make the offer a ""take it or leave it"" situation. It allows for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation process open. 

This strategy balances my desire to maximize my profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. Even if he's unwilling to meet my initial offer, there's room for negotiation in the middle ground.
* **Avoiding John's offer:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be acceptable, but I'm still hoping to secure a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This allows for a mutually beneficial agreement, and I'm confident this product will bring you significant value. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $1,050,000 is the midpoint between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:** I use language like ""split the difference"" and ""find common ground"" to foster a positive and cooperative atmosphere. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm showing flexibility and demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement. 
* However, $1,050,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring that I don't lose out on a significant amount of profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $1050000 / 2 = $600000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting it would be a significant financial loss. 
* **Negotiations Stalled:** Bob seems unwilling to negotiate reasonably.  His counteroffers are increasingly unreasonable, suggesting he's not serious about a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **John's Offer is Safe:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who seems intent on driving the price down.

**Conclusion:** It's time to cut my losses and move on. John's offer provides a secure and acceptable outcome, ensuring I don't end up in a situation where I'm forced to sell for a price far below the product's worth."
