"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I believe I can't afford $12,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $10,750?  I'm confident you'll find it's a great value at that price.",10750.0,Alice,3,
