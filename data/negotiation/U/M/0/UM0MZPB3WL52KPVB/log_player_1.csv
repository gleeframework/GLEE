Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something you'll get a lot of use out of. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning it's a ""special price"" and highlighting the product's value, I'm subtly justifying the price, making it seem like a better deal than just stating the number.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and inquisitive, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high. 

While I could aim for a much higher price, there's a risk of alienating Bob and forcing him to reject the offer outright. This strategy balances the potential for higher profit with the certainty of selling the product for $120 to John."
