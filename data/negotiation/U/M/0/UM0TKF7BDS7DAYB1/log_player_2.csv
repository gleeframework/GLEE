"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,100,000. This represents a significant value to you, as it's worth $1,200,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,000,000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is bluffing. She claims she'll sell the product for less than its value to her if you reject the offer. This is unlikely, as it would result in a financial loss. 

By rejecting her offer, you call her bluff and open the possibility of negotiating a better price or sticking with your backup option of buying from John at $1,200,000."
