Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $750,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This reflects the true value of the product."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're getting closer, but I'm still leaving money on the table if I accept $825,000. It's worth another round of negotiation."

Round 6

Bob is clearly very interested and getting closer to my minimum price. I'm not willing to go below $830,000, but I think I can get that if I hold firm."

It's time to cut bait with Bob. He's unlikely to meet my minimum price at this point, and I'm risking losing a guaranteed $800,000 from John by continuing to haggle.  While I might be able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's not worth the risk of him walking away and me ending up with nothing."
