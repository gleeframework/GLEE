"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it allows for room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a price closer to my ideal selling point. If he rejects this offer, I'll use the next round to try and gauge his interest and determine his maximum value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than $8,000, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable middle ground and be willing to accept it. If he rejects it, I'll have to reconsider my options in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,000 is a good offer. It's only $500 less than my desired price, and it's a significant improvement over Bob's previous offers.  Selling to Bob now is the best option as it's a fair price and  I'm nearing the halfway point in the negotiation rounds.  If I continue,  I risk losing this offer and ending up with the $8,000 from John."
