"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. My counteroffer is $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my needs for this product. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still reflects the significant value it offers you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $900,000 is getting closer, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for its value.  I'm willing to go to $925,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope you'll see the value in moving forward with this price.  Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
