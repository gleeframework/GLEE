Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can do $1,120,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the last offer I'll make, so I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.

This seems like the best move. Alice has stated this is her final offer.  Continuing to push could backfire, leading to a stalemate and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting $1,120,000 secures a significant saving compared to John's offer."
