"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",150.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for a unique product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $130 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $125, which is closer to your original offer. I think this is a fair compromise that balances the value of the product with your budget. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. I think that's the sweet spot where I can get a good deal without breaking the bank.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer you the product for $122.50. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",122.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid $122.50 is still a bit too high for me, Alice. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product, as I mentioned earlier. I think that's the best we can do, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",115.0,Bob,8,
