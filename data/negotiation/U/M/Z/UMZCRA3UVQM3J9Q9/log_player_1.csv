{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly less than Bob's perceived value:** This makes it more likely for him to accept.
* **It's higher than your minimum:**  It ensures you're still making a profit above your minimum threshold. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping the negotiation open for potential counteroffers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum desired profit. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can reach a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit and allows me to achieve my target. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm working with a tight budget.  Would you consider $800,000? That's a fair price that reflects the true value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is equal to John's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, this offer meets my minimum threshold, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
