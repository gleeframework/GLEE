``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but gives him room to negotiate while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further if necessary, but I also have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm also aware that John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my asking price.  I want to see if I can push Bob a little further before making a decision."

# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $925000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while, and while he's shown interest, he's not willing to reach a price that's acceptable to me.  I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not confident we'll come to an agreement.  John has already expressed a willingness to pay my full price, so I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him.  It's a faster and more certain route to my desired outcome."
