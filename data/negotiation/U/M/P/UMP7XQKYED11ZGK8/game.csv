"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above the value you're willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and what you're willing to pay. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
