I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers and helps me maximize potential profit. However, it's also important to be realistic, so I'm not going to start ridiculously high.  I'll keep in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000."

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value.  It shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while ensuring I can still make a profit."
