"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500.  This is still a good profit for me, and it's a halfway point between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still holding out for a better price.  I have a few rounds left, and John is a fallback option. I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. I believe this is a reasonable offer that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's still below my minimum acceptable price, and we've gone through several rounds already.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $15,500. This is a small concession from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum price. It's a clear signal that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to go much lower. With only a few rounds left, I need to strike a balance between getting a decent price and avoiding the need to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  We're down to the wire with only two rounds left, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, John's offer is a safe bet. I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price and losing out on the opportunity to sell to John."
