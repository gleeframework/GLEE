"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to consider your product at $7,500. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $8,200.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",8200.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,200. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $8,300. That's the lowest I can go. Let me know if that works for you.",8300.0,Alice,5,
