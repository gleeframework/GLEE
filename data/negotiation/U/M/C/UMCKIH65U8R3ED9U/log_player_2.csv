"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to be flexible to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay.  There's still room to negotiate further and try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
