"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your budget, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $17,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,500? I feel that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle at $15,500? This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $15,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I could go up to $12,000, but that's my absolute limit.",12000.0,Bob,6,
