,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100.50. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's worth considering. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",100.5,Alice,5,
