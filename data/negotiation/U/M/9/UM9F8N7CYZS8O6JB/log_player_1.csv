"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value and can greatly benefit your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price to leave room for bargaining. 
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** Offering a price significantly higher than $1,200,000 (Bob's value) would likely be a non-starter. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer allows for potential compromises while still aiming for a price significantly above Alice's minimum. 
* **Professional and Open Tone:**  The message aims to establish a collaborative tone and encourage further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly at his own valuation, leaving no room for negotiation in his favor. While accepting would close the deal, it's too early to settle for a price so far below Alice's minimum and desired selling point.  There's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a more agreeable price closer to Alice's target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the product's value. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,350,000. This reflects the true worth of this product and the benefits it brings.  Would you be willing to consider a figure in that range?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm (for now):** Alice is not drastically reducing the price, signaling she believes in her product's value.
* **Moving Closer:** The counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate, but still maintains a significant gap from Bob's initial offer. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** Phrasing the response as a question encourages Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation active. 
* **Focusing on Value:**  Alice reiterates the product's benefits, subtly reminding Bob of what he gains from the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I still think $1,200,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet at $1,250,000? This is the maximum I'm willing to pay 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob is inching up, but at $1,250,000, he's still considerably below Alice's minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited Rounds:** With more rounds available, Alice can apply pressure and gauge Bob's true willingness to move.
* **Backup Option:** The guaranteed offer from John provides a safety net, allowing Alice to negotiate more confidently."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your perspective, and I'm prepared to come down slightly. How about $1,300,000? This offer reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring a fair value for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Alice shows flexibility by lowering the price, but the reduction is relatively small. This signals she's nearing her limit.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** By stating the offer is fair to ""both of us,"" Alice subtly reminds Bob that she's also making compromises.
* **Urgency (Subtle):**  While not explicitly stating it, Alice's willingness to come down in price suggests time might be a factor.  This could subtly pressure Bob to respond more favorably. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** The counteroffer keeps the price well above Alice's absolute minimum, allowing room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,300,000. I'd like to make one final push to meet you in the middle. How about $1,275,000? This is my absolute maximum, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Push"" Language:** Bob's wording suggests this is likely as high as he's willing to go.
* **Significant Movement:** Bob has increased his offer by $75,000 from his previous position.
* **Time Remaining:** While there are rounds left, further negotiation might yield minimal gains.
* **Strong Profit:**  $1,275,000 is a substantial profit for Alice, even if it's slightly below her initial target.

**It's important to recognize this as a judgment call.** Alice *could* try to push for a little more, but the risk of Bob walking away and losing the deal entirely might outweigh the potential reward of a slightly higher price."
