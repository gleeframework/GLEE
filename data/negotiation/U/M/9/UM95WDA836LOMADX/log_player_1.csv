Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $140, which is above Bob's perceived value of $120. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** It's also lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, allowing for a potential compromise. 
* **Positive Tone:** A positive message encourages Bob to consider the offer and opens the door for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than that. 
* **There's still potential for negotiation.**  I can make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, so I have the safety net of selling to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($120). This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $135 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging a positive outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still believe that $120 is the most I can realistically pay for this product. Let me know if this is something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is unwilling to budge.**  He's stuck at $120, which is below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Further negotiation seems pointless.**  I've already made two compromises, and Bob is showing no willingness to increase his offer.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit.**  Selling to John for $150 ensures I meet my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who is unlikely to agree to a higher price."
