"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can get the price down significantly. How about we start at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum threshold.  I'll counter with a price that's more reasonable for both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is just too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving down, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I can go up to $700,000, which I think is a very fair offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to make more, Bob's offer of $700,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  John's offer guarantees me a profit, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob."
