"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price.  It's time to negotiate or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can get the price down significantly. How about we start at $600,000?"", 
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** Starting with a strong counter-offer significantly below your maximum price leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Anchor Bias:** This opening offer attempts to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to your desired range. Alice may be more willing to move towards your price if she sees you're serious but have a limit.
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, you always have the option to walk away and buy from John for $800,000. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is just too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down, $900,000 is still above your maximum price and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's likely still room for Alice to move closer to your range. By rejecting this offer, you signal you're serious about a lower price.
* **John as Leverage:** Keep John's offer in mind. It gives you a strong alternative if Alice won't budge enough."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving down, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I can go up to $700,000, which I think is a very fair offer.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise, moving closer towards Alice's price. 
* **Staying Below Maximum:** It's crucial to remain below your $800,000 maximum price, leaving space for potential final adjustments.
* **Urgency (Optional):** You could add a subtle sense of urgency to encourage Alice to make a decision, like ""I need to finalize this soon."" However, be careful not to sound too desperate."
