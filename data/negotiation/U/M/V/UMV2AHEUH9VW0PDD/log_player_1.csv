""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,350,000. I think this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefit you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money from the sale as possible, knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price. This price gives Bob a significant discount compared to his valuation, making it a tempting offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** If Bob rejects the offer, I still have a secure sale with John."
