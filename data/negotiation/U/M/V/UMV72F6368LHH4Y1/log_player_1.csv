Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer starts high, giving me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  It's also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, leaving me with a good margin of profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility while still leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to go through another round of negotiation. Selling to John guarantees me a good profit, and I don't want to risk losing out on that by continuing to bargain with Bob."
