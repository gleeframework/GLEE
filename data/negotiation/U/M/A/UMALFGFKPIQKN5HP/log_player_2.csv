"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000.  I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While the offer of $14,000 is higher than Alice's valuation, it's still less than your maximum price and importantly, less than buying from John for $15,000. Accepting this offer saves you money."
