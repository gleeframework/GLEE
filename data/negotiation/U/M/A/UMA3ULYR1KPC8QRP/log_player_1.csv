Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it still leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting a price closer to your desired $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's far below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. There's still room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better price by making another counteroffer.  It's important to remember that you can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This price is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with something positive. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
