"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can we meet in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This price is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with something positive. Let me know if you're interested.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
