"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $150 represents fair value for this product, I could be persuaded to let it go for $130.  This is my final offer.",130.0,Alice,3,
