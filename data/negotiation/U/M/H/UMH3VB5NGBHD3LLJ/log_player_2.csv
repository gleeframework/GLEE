"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $1,100,000 is still too close to his maximum.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a strong offer, the product's true value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to push for a price closer to his $900,000 counteroffer. He has plenty of rounds remaining and should try to leverage his position to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your position, and I'm willing to accept $985,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $985,000 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $950,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there is a risk that Alice will reject his next counteroffer and the negotiation could drag on.  Accepting the offer now allows Bob to secure the product at a good price while minimizing the risk of further negotiation.  It's also worth noting that Bob still has 5 rounds remaining, so if he needs to, he can always revisit this decision later if the market changes."
