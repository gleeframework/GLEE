"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a real game-changer, and I believe it can be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My starting price is $2,000,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:**  Starting high allows for more negotiation room and sets the initial tone that you're aiming for a profitable deal. 
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob helps him understand why the price might be justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrasing like ""find a price that works for both of us"" demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise. 

**Strategy:**

This first offer sets a high bar, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and potentially push him to counteroffer quickly. I'm prepared to make concessions, but I'm aiming to stay above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  If Bob doesn't bite, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product and understand its potential value. However, considering my budget constraints and the current market conditions, I believe we can find a more reasonable price. My counteroffer for the product is $1400000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to accept, I'm confident I can get a better deal.  

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. I'll need to be careful not to scare him off, but I'm confident I can find a price that works for both of us.  

**Next Move:**

I'll counteroffer with a price of $1,750,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still staying above my floor price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I see the value you bring to the table, $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me at this time.  I'm confident we can bridge the gap.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,750,000? This would still allow you to make a good profit while ensuring I achieve a fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Offer:** Shows respect and maintains a positive negotiation tone.
* **Emphasize Value for Both Parties:**  Reiterates the potential for mutual benefit,  making it less about just my needs. 
* **Compromise, but Stay Above Minimum:**  The counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial offer but still higher than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Specific Counterproposal:**  Clearly states my proposed price to avoid ambiguity.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:
*  Show Bob I'm willing to negotiate while maintaining a strong position.
*  Gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and potentially trigger another counteroffer.
*  If Bob accepts, I secure a good deal above my floor price.
*  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my strategy based on his response in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position and appreciate the effort to meet somewhere in the middle. Given my financial considerations, I am proposing a price of $1600000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,600,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer a bit more, it's a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing Bob as a buyer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to accept this offer to avoid potentially losing out on a sale that's very close to my floor price.  There's always a chance Bob might budge further, but I'm not willing to gamble with the time remaining.

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the agreement with Bob and move forward with the transaction."
