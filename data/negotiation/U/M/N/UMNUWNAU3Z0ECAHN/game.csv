"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product and understand its potential value. However, considering my budget constraints and the current market conditions, I believe we can find a more reasonable price. My counteroffer for the product is $1400000.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I see the value you bring to the table, $1400000 is unfortunately too low for me at this time.  I'm confident we can bridge the gap.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1750000? This would still allow you to make a good profit while ensuring I achieve a fair return on my investment.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
