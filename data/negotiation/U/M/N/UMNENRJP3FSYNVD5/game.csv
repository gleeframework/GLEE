"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further to find a mutually beneficial price.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for starting the negotiation, Alice. While I agree this product is valuable,  $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $7,000? I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $8,200. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $8,200 is still a bit higher than I'd hoped for.  How about we settle at $7,500? That would work much better for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm thinking of a price of $8,400. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think?",8400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to make this work, but $8,400 is still pushing my budget.  To be completely transparent, $7,800 is the absolute highest I can go.  If that works for you, we have a deal.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $7,800. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $8,100. This is the final compromise I can make. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,7,
