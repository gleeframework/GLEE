"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm initially offering it at $2,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the introduction.  While the product is interesting, that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from a somewhat aggressive initial offer. This gives us room to move upwards while staying well below Alice's valuation and our maximum budget.
* **Signaling Interest:** While the offer is low, it shows we're serious about purchasing but need a significant price reduction.
* **Leaving Room:**  We've left a considerable gap between our offer and our $1,000,000 walk-away point, allowing for flexibility in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages and a strong return on investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget.  To be frank, I'm prepared to walk away at anything over $1,000,000. How about we try to find a compromise around $950,000?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a Limit:** We're clearly establishing our maximum price to signal seriousness and manage Alice's expectations.
* **Justification:** By mentioning our budget constraint, we offer a reason for our position without revealing our true walk-away point (buying from John).
* **Incremental Increase:**  The offer is a significant jump from our previous one, showing willingness to move closer to Alice's price range, but not too much.
* **Time Pressure:** As we approach the halfway point in the negotiation, applying a bit of time pressure might encourage Alice to consider our offer more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. Let's find a way to make this work.  To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer, but I value our discussions and believe we can reach an agreement. Would you be willing to consider $1,400,000? This would be a final offer from my side. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:**  Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by introducing a ""final offer"" and a potential other buyer. This is likely a bluff to pressure us into accepting.
* **Still Too High:**  $1,400,000 remains significantly above our budget and our walk-away price. 
* **Leverage:** We still have John as a backup option, so we're not desperate to accept a bad deal.

It's worth pushing back one more time before considering John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your transparency.  However, that final offer is still far above what I can justify.  If you're truly motivated to sell, I could go as high as $1,050,000, but that's absolutely my limit."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Counter:** We're countering Alice's ""final offer"" tactic with a firm counter-offer very close to our true walk-away price.
* **Slight Concession:**  Increasing to $1,050,000 shows a willingness to budge slightly, potentially keeping Alice engaged.
* **Deadline Pressure:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds, adding pressure on Alice to either accept a price close to our terms or risk losing the deal.
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Option:** We're still below our $1,000,000 alternative, ensuring we don't make a bad deal."
