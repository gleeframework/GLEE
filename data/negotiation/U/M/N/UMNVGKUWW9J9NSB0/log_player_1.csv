Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident this is a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This gives you room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob:**  This makes it appealing to him.
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** The message conveys a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.

By offering a price within this range, you increase your chances of reaching a deal that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a significant price drop from your initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than the price you initially proposed.  You're aiming for a higher price, and there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your desired $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $900,000 is still significantly below what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. It's a fair compromise that still provides value for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above your new offer. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is lower than your ideal price, it's still higher than John's offer.  Given that Bob has rejected your previous counteroffer, accepting his offer now is a reasonable strategy. This secures a sale for you that's above your minimum acceptable price. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer and ending up with John's lower offer."
