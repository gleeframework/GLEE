Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value of $150.
* **Friendly Approach:**  I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport with Bob.  This can help encourage him to accept a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm framing the offer as a question, implying that I'm open to negotiation and willing to listen to Bob's counteroffer. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with keeping the negotiation open and engaging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:**  While $100 is lower than my initial ask, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Potential for Delay:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer risks further delay and the possibility of Bob walking away from the deal altogether.
* **Uncertainty of Counteroffers:**  There's no guarantee that my counteroffer would be successful, and I might end up losing time and potentially selling to John for less.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale, minimizing risk and maximizing immediate return."
