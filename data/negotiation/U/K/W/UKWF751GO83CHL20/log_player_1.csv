Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get closer to my minimum price.  $9,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly lower than its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $9800, but no higher. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement, but if it doesn't work, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,800 is still below what I'm comfortable with. Let's compromise. I'll come down to $10,200. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. If you're not interested, I have another buyer waiting."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to go up to $9500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While I could keep negotiating, it's getting too risky. John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with. I'll sell to John and save myself the time and uncertainty of further negotiations."
