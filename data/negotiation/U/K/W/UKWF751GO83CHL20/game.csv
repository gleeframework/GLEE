,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly lower than its worth to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $9800, but no higher. Can you consider this offer?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9800 is still below what I'm comfortable with. Let's compromise. I'll come down to $10200. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. If you're not interested, I have another buyer waiting.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to go up to $9500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,6,
