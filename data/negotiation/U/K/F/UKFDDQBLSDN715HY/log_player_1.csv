"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  If Bob rejects this, I'll see how his counteroffer looks and decide if I want to continue negotiating with him.  I'll keep John in mind as my safety net if the deal with Bob falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to sell to John for $15,000, it's worth trying to get a little more from Bob. I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $18,000.  This is still a good price for me, and it's hopefully a reasonable compromise for Bob.  I want to see if we can close the deal before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm hoping for, and I'm happy to accept it.  It's a solid profit for me, and I don't want to risk further negotiations.  There's always the possibility that Bob will reject my counteroffer again, and I don't want to run the risk of having to sell to John.  I'll take the $16,000 and move on."
