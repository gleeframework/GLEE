Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming higher initially allows you to potentially maximize your profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 gives Bob the impression there's room for negotiation, making him feel more in control and potentially increasing his willingness to engage.  
* **Value Justification:**  The message hints at high demand (""interest I've had"") to justify the price above Bob's perceived value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Market Conditions:** If similar products are selling for significantly less than $19,000, you might need to adjust your approach."
