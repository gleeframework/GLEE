Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (even if it's just perceived value) can make it seem more palatable. 
* **Urgency:** By mentioning listing it publicly, you create a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100, so you don't need to go lower than that."
