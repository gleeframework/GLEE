Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price. How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,500? This is my final offer.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $14,500.  While getting the product for $14,500 would be okay, I can save more money by going with John's offer of $10,000."
