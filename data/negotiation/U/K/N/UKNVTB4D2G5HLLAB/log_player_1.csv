Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to your ideal outcome.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that the price is justified. 
* **Limited-Time Offer:** The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains conversational with ""What do you think?"",  signaling your willingness to hear Bob's perspective and potentially negotiate.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable compared to the product's stated value."
