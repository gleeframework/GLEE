"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob a good incentive to accept, but also allows me to potentially get closer to his perceived value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000. This product is worth $10,000 to you, so I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not ready to settle for that price yet. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $11,500?  This would be a fair compromise and would still give you a good profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, I'm still not ready to settle. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if I can push him a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $11,500 is still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's a deal you won't regret! Let's finalize this."", ""product_price"": 12500}
