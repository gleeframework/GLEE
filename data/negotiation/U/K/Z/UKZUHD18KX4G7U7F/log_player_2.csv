Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. We believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable,  $900,000 is a bit high for me right now. I would be willing to pay $700,000. I think that's a fair price that reflects its worth to me."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for us, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000, which is still a significant discount from the original value of the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you and our costs. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? That's a substantial investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below our target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $800,000, which is the lowest we can go without sacrificing our profit margin. This is a final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while there might be a small amount of room left to negotiate, the difference is unlikely to be significant enough to warrant the risk of her walking away. Accepting at $800,000 secures a significant discount from both her initial offer and John's price."
