{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  At $120, Bob is still getting a deal compared to his own valuation of $80.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $150. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counteroffers, you have space to bargain without dropping below your minimum.

By starting with this offer, you set the stage for a successful negotiation while maximizing your potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is above Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate, how about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle ground:** $110 is a compromise between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $100.
* **Emphasizes value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the price.
* **Negotiation signal:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $110 is a bit steep given my current budget. Could we perhaps aim for $95? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still expressing interest in your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I've already lowered my price twice. At this point, I'm better off selling to John for $150, guaranteeing that I reach my minimum and avoid further rounds of negotiation that may not yield a better outcome."
