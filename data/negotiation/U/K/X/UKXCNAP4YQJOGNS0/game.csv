"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get as close to the market value as possible.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'd love to hear your thoughts.",10800.0,Bob,4,
