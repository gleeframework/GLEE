Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable to my business, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Could we meet somewhere around $900,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is closer, but to be honest, anything over $1,000,000 is going to be a tough sell for me. How about we split the difference and call it $1,050,000?
