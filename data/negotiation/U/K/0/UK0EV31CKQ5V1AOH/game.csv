"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable to my business, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Could we meet somewhere around $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is closer, but to be honest, anything over $1,000,000 is going to be a tough sell for me. How about we split the difference and call it $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very fair throughout this negotiation and I respect that.  I'm willing to come up slightly. How about $1,060,000? This would allow me to make the purchase while still keeping within a reasonable budget.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come up, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,060,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $1,070,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1070000.0,Alice,7,
