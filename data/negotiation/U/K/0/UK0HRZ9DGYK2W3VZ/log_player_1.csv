Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm trying to build rapport by emphasizing the product's value and making it feel like a personalized offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a higher price while keeping in mind that John is a safety net at $12,000. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is at my minimum value. While I could accept and sell to him, I'm hoping to get a better price.  

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter him.  He's clearly interested in the product, and I'm hoping I can convince him to pay a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me to let this product go. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $15,000? This gives you a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a fair price for the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $15,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's. 
* **Message:** I'm addressing Bob's concerns (price) while maintaining my position on value. I'm emphasizing the discount to make it seem more appealing.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that by offering a middle ground, I can convince Bob to come up in price. This is a reasonable counteroffer, and I believe there's a good chance he might accept it. If he rejects, I'll have to weigh the risk of another counteroffer against selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,500 is higher than my minimum value of $12,000, and it's a significant increase from his previous offer.  

**Strategy:**

While I'd like to push for more, I'm nearing my minimum value, and Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate.  Accepting his offer secures a sale at a price I'm comfortable with, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or even a breakdown in the deal."
