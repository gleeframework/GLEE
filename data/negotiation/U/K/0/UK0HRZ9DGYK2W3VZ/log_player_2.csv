Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $12000 is simply too low for me to let this product go. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $15000? This gives you a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a fair price for the value of this product.
