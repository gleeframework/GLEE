"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still offers you a significant value, and it's within a reasonable range for both of us. Let's find a solution that works.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I'm still aiming to keep the price at $1,000,000. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
