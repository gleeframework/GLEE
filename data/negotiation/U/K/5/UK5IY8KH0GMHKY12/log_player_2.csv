"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive, but not ideal.**  It's significantly lower than what John is selling for, but there's still room for negotiation to save more.
* **There's no need to rush.** You have 10 rounds to close the deal, so rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $850,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is aggressive but still leaves room for negotiation.**  By offering $850,000, Bob is making a significant move toward Alice's asking price, but still leaves room to potentially negotiate further.
* **The message emphasizes value and fairness.**  This approach aims to build a positive relationship while communicating Bob's commitment to a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more competitive. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm getting close to considering other offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget and represents a significant savings.**  $875,000 is substantially lower than John's price, and it's only $25,000 more than Bob's last offer.
* **Alice's message implies a sense of urgency.** She mentions considering other offers, which could mean that continuing to negotiate might risk losing the product.
* **There's limited upside to further negotiation.** While Bob might be able to get a slightly lower price, it's unlikely to be significantly better than $875,000. 

Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a good deal and minimizes the risk of losing out on the product."
