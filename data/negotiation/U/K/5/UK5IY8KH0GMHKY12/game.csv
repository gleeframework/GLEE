"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $850,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more competitive. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm getting close to considering other offers.",875000.0,Alice,3,
