Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm still a bit short on profit. How about we try $102.50? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

We've gotten Alice down to $102.50.  While we might be able to get the price down a little more, it's getting riskier.  Accepting this offer guarantees a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John for $150."
