"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,300,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Confident Tone:** By expressing confidence in the product's value, I aim to influence Bob's perception and potentially encourage a counteroffer closer to my desired range.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This initial offer sets the stage for me to gradually lower the price in subsequent rounds, while still aiming for a final price well above my minimum.
 
It's important to note that while John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, it's strategically beneficial to explore the possibility of a higher profit with Bob, at least for the first few rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask and potentially leaves a substantial amount of money on the table.  

It's early in the negotiation, and I've established a strong starting point.  Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about a higher value and encourages Bob to move closer to my range. By rejecting, I maintain the opportunity to negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. It's clear we both see the value in this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,175,000.  This reflects a significant adjustment on my end and still ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer, signaling flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Targeting Above Midpoint:** My new price is slightly above the midpoint between Bob's counteroffer ($950,000) and my previous price ($1,300,000). This keeps me anchored above my minimum target while encouraging Bob to move closer to my range.
* **Maintaining Value Emphasis:** I continue to emphasize the ""fair deal"" aspect, reinforcing the product's value and justifying the higher price point. 

My goal is to find a balance between securing a favorable price and progressing the negotiation towards a successful close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you've made a significant adjustment, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the adjustments you've made. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has decreased for the second round in a row, signaling that he might not be willing to meet my desired price range. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob's subsequent offers will remain below John's guaranteed $1,000,000. 

At this stage, it makes the most strategic sense to secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John. It eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob and guarantees I meet my minimum acceptable price."
