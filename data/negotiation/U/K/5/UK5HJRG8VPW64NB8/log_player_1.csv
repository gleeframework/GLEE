Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay a premium.
* **Strong Starting Point:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters but still ensures a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Clear Expectations:** The ""take-it-or-leave-it"" approach emphasizes the value you place on the product and avoids lengthy back-and-forth negotiations.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perception:** While the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, his willingness to pay more might depend on factors like urgency, perceived value, or alternatives. 
* **Negotiation Style:** This offer assumes a more direct negotiation approach. You could adjust the message and price depending on your preferred style and knowledge of Bob."
