{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I explicitly state I'm open to negotiation, which signals that I'm willing to find a price that works for both of us.

This approach aims to maximize my profit while also being open to a deal that might be beneficial for Bob.  I can then adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the recommendation, but I am only able to pay up to $90 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my preferred margin. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is a safer bet than risking a further negotiation with Bob that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate. 

I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate.  I'll see if I can push for a better price in the next round, but I'm prepared to walk away and get a guaranteed $100 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $90 is a little lower than I'd hoped for. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product, and I want to make sure it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to accept the offer.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair deal for both of us, emphasizing collaboration over pure negotiation.

This counteroffer gives Bob a reasonable price increase while still allowing me to earn more than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $92 as my offer for the product. This price allows me to stay within my budget while still providing a fair offer for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Close Enough:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit too low.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk that further negotiation with Bob could lead to a lower price or a stalemate. I'm not confident I can push him higher. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is my minimum acceptable price and provides a safe and reliable outcome.

I'm willing to walk away from this deal to secure a guaranteed profit, rather than risk getting a lower price or no deal at all."
