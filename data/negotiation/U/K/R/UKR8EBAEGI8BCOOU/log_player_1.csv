"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, aiming to leave room for negotiation while still getting a good price.  Bob knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, but I know it's worth at least $1,500,000 to me.  This opening offer is a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is far too low, especially given the value of the product to me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm offering $1,500,000, my minimum price for this product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  It's also a reasonable compromise given Bob's previous offer.  If he's serious about buying, he should be willing to meet me at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I want to try to get closer to my target of $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,400,000. This is a good compromise, as it's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his original $1,000,000.  With only a few rounds left, I'm hoping this offer will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I believe we can still close the deal at a higher number. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,350,000. This is a more reasonable compromise with only a few rounds left. It's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping this final push will convince him to close the deal."
