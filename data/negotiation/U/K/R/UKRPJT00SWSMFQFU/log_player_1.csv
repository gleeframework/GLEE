Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so aiming slightly below that maximizes potential profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, there's a small margin for Bob to negotiate down if he wants, potentially leading to a quicker sale. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to avoid going to the backup buyer, John."
