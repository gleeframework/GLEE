"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's offering a price that is lower than Alice's offer but still higher than Alice's minimum selling price. This shows he's serious about buying the product, but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that to you considering the benefits it offers. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is closer to Bob's desired price of $13,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and he'll be forced to buy from John for $15,000.  Accepting the offer at $13,500 saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially beneficial option."
