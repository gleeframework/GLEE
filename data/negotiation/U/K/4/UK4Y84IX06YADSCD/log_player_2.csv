Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm still not comfortable going below $100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $95. It's a great price, and I think you'll really like the product!

It seems like Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $95.  While getting the product for $95 isn't bad, it's better to stick to the budget and buy from John for $80."
