"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance Bob can get a better deal with Alice or at least get closer to his $800,000 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a strong counteroffer, aiming to get the price close to his maximum budget.  Offering $850,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to negotiate. This counteroffer leaves room for potential compromise while staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  While this offer is closer to his goal than the previous one, it's still not a good deal for Bob.  

By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to his target.  If Alice continues to be inflexible, Bob can always opt to buy from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is raising his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  Offering $900,000 is still a significant discount from Alice's last offer, but it's a step closer to meeting Alice's needs. This move shows that Bob is serious about buying the product, but he's still determined to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still too high for Bob.  It's clear that Alice is not willing to negotiate down to a price that Bob is comfortable with.  

Rather than continuing to negotiate and potentially getting stuck in a cycle of rejections, Bob decides to buy the product from John for $800,000. This guarantees him the product at a price that aligns with his budget.  While it might not be the absolute lowest possible price, it's the most sensible and efficient decision given the current negotiation situation."
