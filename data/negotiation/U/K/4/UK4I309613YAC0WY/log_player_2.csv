"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $22,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $22,000 is far above his budget of $12,000, and he knows he can get the product from John for a better price.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $22,000 is way out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $22,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $18,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than he wants to pay.  He's already signaled his willingness to pay $12,000, so it's worth seeing if he can continue to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $14,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
