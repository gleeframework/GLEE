"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value and my current financial constraints, I'd like to offer you $1,300,000. This is a substantial amount and I believe it represents a fair compromise.  I'm eager to finalize this deal, but I'm also prepared to walk away if this isn't acceptable.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position. However, $1,300,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this price point represents a more reasonable compromise.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I'm willing to negotiate, $1,800,000 is still outside of my comfort zone.  I understand the product's value, but I can't justify that price.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair and mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
