"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit below the midpoint of our valuations, leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to see if Bob is willing to pay a higher price while also securing a significant profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I will reject this offer and continue negotiating to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm offering you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering a price that is still above my minimum threshold while also demonstrating flexibility in my negotiation.  This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I am also determined to secure a price that is closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering your offer, I would like to propose a price of $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now within my minimum acceptable price range.  While I would prefer a higher price, accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations or potentially having to sell to John at a lower price."
