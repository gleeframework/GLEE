"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your portfolio.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe the product is a good fit for my portfolio, but I have to consider my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is quite far from my initial asking price. This product has the potential to generate significant returns, and I'm confident it's worth a premium. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
