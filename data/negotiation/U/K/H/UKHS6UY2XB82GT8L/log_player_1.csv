Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your consideration, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
