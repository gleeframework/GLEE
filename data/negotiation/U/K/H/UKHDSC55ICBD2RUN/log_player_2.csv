Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll gain.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  However, the value of this product is substantial. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest I'm willing to go.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:**  Alice has stated that $1,500,000 is her final offer. She's working with a much higher perceived value of the product. 
* **You have a viable alternative:** John offers the product at your target price of $800,000. 
* **Continuing is risky:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a price you're willing to pay.

It makes the most financial sense to secure the product from John at your desired price point."
