# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is offering the product for $200,000 less than its value to you and what John is offering.  There's no guarantee of getting a better deal, so it's best to accept this very favorable offer."
