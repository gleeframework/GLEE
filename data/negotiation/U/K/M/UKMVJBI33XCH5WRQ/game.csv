"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, I must respectfully decline your counteroffer of $850,000. Our company has invested significantly in this product, and we need to ensure that we receive a fair return for our efforts. Considering the unique features and benefits of this product, I propose a revised price of $950,000. This still represents a substantial discount compared to its intrinsic value, but it allows us to align more closely with your budget while ensuring that our investment is respected.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value I'll get out of this product, I'm confident that $900,000 is a fair price that allows us to both walk away satisfied.  I believe this is a reasonable middle ground, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I acknowledge your position and understand the importance of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. In light of your latest offer, I am prepared to consider $925,000 as a fair price for the product. This proposal aims to bridge the gap between our positions while ensuring a reasonable return for our investment. I hope this revised offer will be acceptable to you and allows us to move forward with this transaction.",925000.0,Alice,5,
