Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $110."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $110 gives Bob a $10 discount (making it more enticing than rejecting) and earns you a $30 profit.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob, knowing you have a backup buyer if needed."
