"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than our maximum budget. We should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to understand Alice's lower bound and potentially secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to her value, but we still have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, $125 is getting closer.  How about we meet in the middle at $117?"",
 ""product_price"": 117
}
``` 

We are making a smaller counteroffer, signaling our interest but also our willingness to walk away if needed. By proposing a price near the middle, we aim to achieve a fair compromise."
