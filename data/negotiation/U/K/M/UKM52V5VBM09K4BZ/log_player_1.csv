"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, but it still leaves room for potential negotiation. It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to his valuation ($800,000) than mine ($1,200,000).  While it's tempting to accept, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer and closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a little more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000.  This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering my minimum desired price and Bob's willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go significantly below my minimum desired price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I get the best possible price."
