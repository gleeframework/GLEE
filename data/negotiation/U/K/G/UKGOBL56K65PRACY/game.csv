"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you place on the product and my original asking price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is a fair price that considers both our positions.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
