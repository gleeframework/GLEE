{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's a strong starting point:**  You can adjust your price based on his response. 

Remember, you always have the option to accept John's offer of $8,000 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is a good profit, it's still below the product's potential value. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,500? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle on $9,750? It's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$9,750 is a good price, close to the midpoint of your desired price and Bob's previous offer. It's a reasonable compromise, and accepting it ensures you'll get a good profit without risking further negotiations that could potentially lead to a lower offer or a sale to John for a lower price."
