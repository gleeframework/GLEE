"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $175?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $175 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $187?"",
""product_price"": 187
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $187 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $180. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $180 is a good deal. It's a solid profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether."
