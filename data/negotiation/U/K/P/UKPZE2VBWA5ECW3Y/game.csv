"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product and the value you place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not ready to accept $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
