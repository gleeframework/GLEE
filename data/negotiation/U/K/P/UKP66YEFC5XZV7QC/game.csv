"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $95. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $95 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $90. How about we try $92.50? It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",92.5,Alice,5,
