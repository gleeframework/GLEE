Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm asking for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get more than you expected. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how eager Bob is to buy. If he accepts immediately, you know there was room to go even higher. If he rejects, his counteroffer will reveal how far apart you are in your valuations.
* **John as Backup:**  Keep in mind that you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in your negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $9,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $9,000 is higher than his perceived value ($8,000), indicating he's willing to negotiate.
* You have a guaranteed offer from John for $10,000. Accepting $9,000 would be a loss. 
* By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you value the product higher and encourage him to potentially increase his offer closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?"", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This approach often feels fair to both parties involved in a negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  While you're willing to go down to $10,000 (John's offer), aiming slightly higher keeps the negotiation active and allows room for Bob to potentially counter with an amount above your minimum. 
* **Maintaining Firmness:** You're signaling that you're serious about the value of your product but also showing a willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $9,500, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:**  Bob increasing his offer by only a small increment suggests he's nearing his maximum price. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him not moving further, potentially wasting your time and leading to a lower final selling price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer of $10,000 guarantees you a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.  

While there's a chance Bob might go slightly higher, it's not worth risking the sure sale at your desired minimum price."
