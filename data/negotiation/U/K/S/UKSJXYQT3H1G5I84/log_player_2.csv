Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than John's price, it's still above Bob's ideal.  Rejecting the offer again allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
