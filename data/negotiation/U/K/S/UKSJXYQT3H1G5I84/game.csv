"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value. However, I'm looking to secure a better deal. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects its market worth and allows us both to secure a mutually beneficial transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's compromise further at $875,000. This price is fair, acknowledges the product's potential, and allows us to close the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
