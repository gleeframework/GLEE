"Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer.  I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000. This is a very competitive price for something of this caliber.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,350,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
