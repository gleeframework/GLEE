"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10500, given the product's value and our time invested in this negotiation. This is a fair price, considering your own evaluation of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
