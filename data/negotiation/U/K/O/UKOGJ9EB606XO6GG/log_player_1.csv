"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a range that he might consider. 
* **Optimistic but Realistic:** $1,750,000 allows for potential negotiation and leaves some room for me to earn more than my minimum desired price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the value to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, but I'm not afraid to push for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While it's a good starting point for negotiation, $1,300,000 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Exploring Counteroffers:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my target and test Bob's commitment. 
* **Jhon is a Backup:**  While Jhon is a solid option, I still see potential in negotiating with Bob. I'm not ready to give up on a potentially higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. It's a fair price considering the value this product offers you. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer Closer to My Target:**  I'm moving closer to my minimum desired price while still showing flexibility.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, subtly suggesting he should be willing to pay more.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"" Framing:** This implies a compromise and makes the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  I'm remaining friendly and open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:** $1,450,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a Slight Improvement:** While it's tempting to accept, I think I can still push for a slightly higher price.
* **Testing Bob's Limits:**  By rejecting, I'm testing Bob's commitment to buying the product.  
* **Jhon is a Safe Option:**  While I'm not ready to close the deal with Jhon just yet, knowing he's there provides security."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,450,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Bob:** I'm decreasing my price, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $1,550,000 is still above my minimum desired price, securing a decent profit.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" to encourage Bob to accept.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** $1,400,000 is below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** We've gone through several rounds, and Bob's offers are consistently below my target.
* **Jhon is a Secure Option:**  Selling to Jhon guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation.
* **Time is a Factor:**  With only four rounds left, I don't want to risk losing a deal with Jhon for a potentially smaller profit from Bob."
