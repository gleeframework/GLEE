"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $750,000 is a good starting point, it's below what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This would still allow you to make a profit and would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $825,000, which is a fair compromise given our previous offers. This is my final offer, so please let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",825000.0,Alice,5,
