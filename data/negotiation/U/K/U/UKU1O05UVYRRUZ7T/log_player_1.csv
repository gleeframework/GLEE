Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" aspect, appealing to Bob's potential profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The question ""What do you think?"" signals that I'm open to discussing his perspective.

**Strategy:**

This strategy balances maximizing my profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. By starting high, I leave room to negotiate down while still potentially getting a good price. If Bob rejects, I can evaluate his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or going with the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob is still interested, and his counteroffer suggests some flexibility. This creates an opportunity to continue negotiating.
* **Risk of losing John:**  Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, but I'm willing to risk losing him for a potential higher price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range. This keeps the negotiation alive and potentially yields a more favorable outcome.  However, I'll closely monitor the situation to avoid prolonging the negotiation beyond a point where it becomes too risky to lose John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $750,000 is a good starting point, it's below what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This would still allow you to make a profit and would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value for Both:** The message highlights the potential profit for Bob while emphasizing fairness for both of us. 
* **Staying Firm:**  The price is still above Bob's perceived value, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The question ""Let me know what you think"" leaves the door open for further discussion.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while staying close to my desired price. It maintains the negotiation and gives Bob a chance to accept a price closer to my initial offer. If Bob rejects again, I'll need to carefully assess my options, considering the risk of losing John and the potential for further negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $850,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $775,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is an increase, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk of losing John:** The time spent negotiating with Bob is increasing the risk of losing John, who is a guaranteed $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  There's still a gap between Bob's offer and my desired price, indicating potential for further negotiations.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, hoping to bridge the gap and reach a mutually acceptable price. However, if the next round doesn't result in a deal closer to my minimum, I'll strongly consider selling to John to secure the guaranteed profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $825,000, which is a fair compromise given our previous offers. This is my final offer, so please let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling this is my final concession to push Bob towards a decision. 
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the potential loss of the deal to motivate Bob. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The mention of other buyers highlights the potential risk for Bob.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to finalize the deal at a price that's more favorable to me while still being potentially acceptable to Bob. If Bob rejects, I'll likely accept John's offer to avoid further negotiations and secure a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $825,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $780,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  Negotiations have gone on for multiple rounds, and Bob is consistently offering prices significantly below my minimum.
* **Risk of Losing John:** The longer I negotiate with Bob, the greater the risk of John withdrawing his offer or finding another seller. 
* **Minimal Potential Gain:**  Even if Bob were to accept a price closer to my minimum, the potential gain is small compared to the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. 

**Strategy:**

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't secure a higher price from Bob, it's become clear that further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of losing him completely."
