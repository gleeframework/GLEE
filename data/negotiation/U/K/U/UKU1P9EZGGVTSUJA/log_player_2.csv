"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $1,000,000 is still too high. It's better to negotiate with Alice and see if a lower price can be reached before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is starting with a significant discount from Alice's offer. This shows that he's serious about negotiating and that he is aware of the product's worth to him.  He is aiming to be aggressive but not completely unreasonable, as he wants to leave room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is coming down, but $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum.  It is worthwhile to continue negotiating to see if Alice will come down further. Bob still has a good chance of getting a lower price before needing to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows that he's willing to compromise but still wants a good deal.  He is aiming to find a middle ground between his initial offer and Alice's latest offer. He's trying to gauge if Alice is willing to meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down to $925,000. While it is still above Bob's desired price, it is only $25,000 away from his maximum.  It's a good deal considering Alice's initial asking price and the fact that Bob has a backup option with John. It's not worth risking further rounds and potentially losing the deal altogether for such a small difference."
