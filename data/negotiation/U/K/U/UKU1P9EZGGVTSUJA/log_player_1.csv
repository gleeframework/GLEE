"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price closer to my desired $1,200,000.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for my desired price at any time, so I'm not overly pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I want to maximize profit, I also need to be strategic.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me the opportunity to counter with a price closer to my desired value. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as there's still potential to negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm aiming for a middle ground, offering a price that's closer to my desired $1,200,000 but still within a range that Bob might be willing to accept. This counteroffer signals my willingness to negotiate while also maintaining my stance that the product is worth significantly more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still below my desired value. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I keep the negotiation open and maintain the possibility of a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm incrementally increasing my counteroffer, but still staying within a range that I believe is reasonable, given Bob's increasing offers. This shows that I'm flexible and willing to negotiate while maintaining my goal of getting as close to my desired $1,200,000 as possible."
