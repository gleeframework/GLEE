Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the value I place on the product, I am willing to offer $820,000 for it. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  $820,000 is too low, considering the product's value to me and the fact that I can get $800,000 from John. I want to see if I can push Bob higher in the next round."

Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
