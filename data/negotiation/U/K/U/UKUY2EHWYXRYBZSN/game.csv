"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about $1,100,000?  That's a significant move on my part to try and meet you closer to your price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I understand you're trying to find a price that works, and I'm doing the same.  Would you consider $1,250,000? That's a compromise closer to my original asking price while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
