"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is less than what John is offering, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $95 is still above your ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $95 is a bit above my budget.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my asking price. How about $90?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to your ideal price point, you can still likely get it for less. You are aiming to save as much money as possible and can continue to negotiate with Alice."
