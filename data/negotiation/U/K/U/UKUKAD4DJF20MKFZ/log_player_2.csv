"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

$1,025,000 is still too high for Bob. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will go lower."

However, I value the rapport we've built during our negotiation. I'm willing to make a final offer of $975,000. This is my absolute bottom line, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.

While $975,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer before potentially buying from John."
