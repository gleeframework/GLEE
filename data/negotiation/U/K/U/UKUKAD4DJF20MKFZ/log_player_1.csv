While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are incrementally increasing and still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap in a reasonable timeframe. Accepting John's offer ensures I receive the full value of the product without further risk or delay."
