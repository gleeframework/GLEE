"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,150? It's a fair price for a valuable product.",10150.0,Alice,5,
