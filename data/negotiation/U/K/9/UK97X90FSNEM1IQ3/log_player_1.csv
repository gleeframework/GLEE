{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so that's the absolute ceiling.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping you well above your minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, but it's always best to try for the higher offer first."
