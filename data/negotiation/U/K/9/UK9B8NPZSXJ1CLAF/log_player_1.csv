Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $90 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my desired price of $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50?  I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $87.50.  How about we split the difference and go with $86.25?  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $86.25 is still below my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise and getting closer to my minimum. With limited rounds left, it's a good move to close the deal now and avoid the risk of going lower or potentially losing the sale altogether to John."
