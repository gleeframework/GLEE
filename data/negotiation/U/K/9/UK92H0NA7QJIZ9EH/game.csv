"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $10000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit to $8500. This would still allow me to make a decent profit, and it's closer to your offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $7250. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite comfortable with $7250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $7625. This is a fair price considering its value, and it's a reasonable compromise.  Let me know what you think.",7625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $7625 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $7200, but no more. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price?",7200.0,Bob,6,
