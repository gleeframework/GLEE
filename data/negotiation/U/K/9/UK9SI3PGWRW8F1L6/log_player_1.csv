Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than the minimum you are willing to accept. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring you still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $100 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $95, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $90 is still a decent profit for me.  It's better than selling to John for $120 and I can avoid the hassle of further negotiations."
