"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no reason to accept an offer above that. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for potential negotiation or can proceed with your backup option."
