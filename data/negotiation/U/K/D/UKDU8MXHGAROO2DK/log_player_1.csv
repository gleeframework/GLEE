"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell below my minimum just yet. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $12,000. This is still higher than my minimum value, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer, avoiding further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better offer. I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm not ready to sell at that price yet. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $11,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum and shows that I'm serious about negotiating.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize that this is a fair price and accept the offer, but if he doesn't, I might need to start thinking about selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is tempting, I'm going to reject this offer. I'm not willing to sell below my minimum yet. I believe that John is a better option at this point, as his offer is only $500 below my minimum. I'm hoping that I can secure a better deal from Bob in the next round, but I'm prepared to walk away from the deal and accept John's offer if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $10,500. This is my final offer, as it's only $500 above my minimum and I'm not willing to go lower. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John. I'm hoping that Bob recognizes the value of the product and is willing to meet me halfway at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum value, but I've already rejected his counteroffer in the previous round. It seems he's unwilling to go higher, and I'm not willing to accept less than my minimum.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $10,000. This ensures I get my minimum value and avoids further negotiations with Bob."
