Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob only values the product at $80,  it's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin for Alice. 
* **Staying Reasonable:** Offering it at $125 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value but still a good deal lower than what John is willing to pay.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he flat out rejects it, Alice hasn't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John."
