"I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $10,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit more to make this happen. How about $11,500?  That's still a great price considering the value this product brings to you. ",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
