Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something you've been looking for, and I believe it can be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $13,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000** is a starting point that is above my minimum value ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. 
* **The message** is friendly and builds a little rapport while highlighting the value of the product to Bob. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, I can see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my desired value. If he rejects, I can then adjust the price based on his counteroffer and my own willingness to continue negotiating with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not eager to accept it right away. I believe the product is worth more and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Test the waters:**  I want to see how determined Bob is to buy the product.  
* **Potentially get a higher price:**  By making a counteroffer, I might be able to secure a price closer to my initial asking price of $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $10,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit more to make this happen. How about $11,500?  That's still a great price considering the value this product brings to you. "", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $11,500, which is still above my minimum but significantly lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:**  The message acknowledges Bob's desire for a good deal and highlights the value of the product to him. It also reinforces the ""great price"" aspect of the counteroffer. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, hopefully leading to a quick and mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's close to my counteroffer of $11,500, and significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Accepting his offer means:

* **A quick sale:**  It avoids further negotiation and allows me to move on.
* **A solid profit:**  I'll be earning $1,000 more than my minimum, which is a good outcome.

While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I'd be stuck with selling to John for a lower price."
