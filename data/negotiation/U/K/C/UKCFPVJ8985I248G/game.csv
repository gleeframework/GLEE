"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $950,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth while also allowing you a significant gain.  Let's see if we can work together to make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $750,000. Would that be agreeable to you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I understand this is your final offer, so I'm willing to stretch my budget to $780,000. This is a strong offer, and I hope we can close the deal on it.",780000.0,Bob,6,
