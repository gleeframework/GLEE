"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $925,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, given the product's value to me.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  While I appreciate your offer, I can't sell it for less than $900,000. This product holds significant value and I'm confident it will bring you great returns.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
