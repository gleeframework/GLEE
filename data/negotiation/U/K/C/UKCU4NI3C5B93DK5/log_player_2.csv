"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering its value and rarity. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still a significant amount of money. There's a chance to negotiate a better price, especially since Alice is clearly motivated to sell.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $750,000. This is a fair price given my budget and the potential value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  I'm going for a significant drop in price. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and might pressure Alice into making a quicker concession.
* **Justification:**  I've offered a reason for the lower price (my budget) and tried to appeal to the product's potential value. This makes the counteroffer more appealing and less arbitrary.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While $750,000 is significantly lower, there's still room to negotiate if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to compromise on the value of this product. Considering its rarity and potential, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice has moved from $900,000 to $825,000, a substantial drop.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Alice has indicated she's willing to meet halfway, which suggests a desire to close the deal.
* **Still Within Budget:**  $825,000 is within my budget and a good price considering the product's value. 

It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse price or missing out on the product altogether."
