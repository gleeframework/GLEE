"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $750000. This is a fair price given my budget and the potential value of the product. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to compromise on the value of this product. Considering its rarity and potential, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's worth.",825000.0,Alice,3,
