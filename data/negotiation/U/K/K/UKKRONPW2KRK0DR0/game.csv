"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair price that reflects the immense value this product will bring to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
