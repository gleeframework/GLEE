Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise at $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go.

**Reasoning:** Alice is not budging significantly on price. Her counter offer of $1,075,000 is getting too close to John's offer of $1,200,000. It's unlikely further negotiation will result in a significant enough saving to warrant the risk of Alice walking away."
