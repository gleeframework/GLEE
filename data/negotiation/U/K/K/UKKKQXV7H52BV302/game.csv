"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $142.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",142.5,Alice,3,

"Bob, I think $125 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. Let's try $135. That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",135.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's my limit.",130.0,Bob,6,
