"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. I believe it's a great value considering its worth to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing the negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to go up to $13,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves room for negotiation. Bob is hoping Alice will accept the counteroffer, but he's prepared to continue the negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to go down to $14,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than what John is offering, Bob is still aiming to get the product for lower than $14,000. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm happy to pay $13,750. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increased his offer slightly from the previous round, showing his willingness to negotiate, but he's still keeping it lower than Alice's last offer. This strategy aims to get Alice to accept the offer but keeps Bob within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit higher than $13,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,875. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get and I'm getting closer to my desired amount.  Let's reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,875 is still a good deal for Bob. It is lower than John's price of $15,000, and it's only slightly higher than Bob's last counteroffer of $13,750. With a few rounds left, it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation. It's likely that Alice will not budge much further and the risk of reaching a stalemate or running out of rounds is high."
