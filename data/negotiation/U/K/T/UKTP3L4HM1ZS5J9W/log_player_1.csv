"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low.  $900,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'll need to see a significantly higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my target price.  How about $1,050,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's more in line with what I need."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking to maximize your profit. How about we split the difference and settle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price with further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  Let's try $1,025,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to reach my desired profit margin."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to make this work, but I need to be realistic about my budget. My absolute limit is $990,000. If you can accept that, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. 

While I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price, Bob's latest offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. The negotiation seems to be getting stalled, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John. It's better to secure the $1,200,000 now than to continue negotiating and potentially end up with nothing."
