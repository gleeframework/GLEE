"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be very valuable to you. I'm initially offering it for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $9,500. This indicates there's room for negotiation. 
* **You have time:** You have 10 rounds, so there's no rush to accept a high initial offer.
* **Counteroffers can save you money:** By rejecting the offer, you can explore a lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I think $9,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's still within a reasonable range considering the product's worth to her ($8,000). 
* **Negotiation Room:** This leaves room for further negotiation, as there's still a gap between your offer and Alice's potential minimum. 
* **Staying Competitive:**  While you could go lower, this offer is still more appealing to Alice than the $10,000 John is offering."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the value this product brings justifies a higher price point. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your ideal price point and what the product is worth to her. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room to haggle and reach a price closer to your target. 
* **Time is on your side:** With 8 rounds remaining, you can afford to be patient and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer represents a compromise, offering a price point closer to Alice's last offer while still being within your budget.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** This offer signals that you are serious about buying the product, but you won't overpay.
* **Room for Agreement:** It leaves some room for Alice to negotiate slightly, but it's likely more attractive than going to John."
