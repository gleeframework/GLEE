"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $75. This is an exceptional opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. Don't miss out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a great deal! You're getting the product for $5 less than your maximum budget and what it's worth to Alice. There's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate a better price, and going to John means you'll pay full price."
