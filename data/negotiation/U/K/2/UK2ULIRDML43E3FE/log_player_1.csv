Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell below $1,000,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's beneficial for you while still enticing Bob to accept.  Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects its worth in the market.  This is a time-sensitive offer as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value.  Mentioning other interested parties (even if John is your only other option) adds a touch of urgency.
* **Price:**  $1,150,000 allows Bob to potentially gain $50,000 in value while you earn a significant profit above your minimum.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** This offer assumes there will be some negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower.  
* **Relationship:**  If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price to ensure a positive first interaction.
