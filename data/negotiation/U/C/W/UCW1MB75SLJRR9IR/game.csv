"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000.",8500.0,Alice,3,
