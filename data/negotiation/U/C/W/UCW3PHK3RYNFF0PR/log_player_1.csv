Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that might be of interest to you. I'm asking $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping he'll negotiate.  I want to see if I can get closer to the $100 mark."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $75. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below my floor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $75 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counter-offering at $85, which is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to compromise.  This keeps the negotiation moving while ensuring I don't sell below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $85, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $82.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's a good compromise.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $90, it's not worth risking a deal and going back and forth further. Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a price that's profitable for me."
