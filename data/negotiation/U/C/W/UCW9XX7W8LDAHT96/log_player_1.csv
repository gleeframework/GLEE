"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to both of us.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Given its worth, I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

My strategy here is to start with an ambitious offer significantly above both our valuations. This allows room for negotiation and potentially lets me secure a deal much closer to $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,500,000 is a bit out of my budget. Given the product's value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 would be a fair starting point for both of us. This reflects the product's worth while allowing for a reasonable profit margin for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in hopes of securing a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the product's value.  While $1,100,000 is certainly a strong offer, I believe the product's unique nature warrants a slightly higher price.  I'm proposing $1,350,000 as a compromise that acknowledges its worth while still offering you a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

I've come down from my initial offer but am still aiming significantly above Bob's offer. This demonstrates some flexibility while maintaining a firm stance on the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However, $1,350,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects both the product's worth and my financial limitations. Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is moving closer to my initial offer, and $1,200,000 is a substantial profit.  Continuing to push for a higher price risks losing the deal altogether. It's time to accept and secure a successful outcome."
