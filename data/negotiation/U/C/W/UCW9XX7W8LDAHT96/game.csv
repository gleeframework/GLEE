"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to both of us.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Given its worth, I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,500,000 is a bit out of my budget. Given the product's value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 would be a fair starting point for both of us. This reflects the product's worth while allowing for a reasonable profit margin for you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the product's value.  While $1,100,000 is certainly a strong offer, I believe the product's unique nature warrants a slightly higher price.  I'm proposing $1,350,000 as a compromise that acknowledges its worth while still offering you a fair deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However, $1,350,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects both the product's worth and my financial limitations. Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
