{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message and sets a price that's a bit below Bob's perceived value, potentially encouraging him to accept. If he rejects, we'll see what counteroffer he makes and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're aiming for a higher price than $130. We can try to push for closer to our initial offer by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $135. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $135 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $132. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is close to our minimum price point, and we're likely not going to get much higher.  It's best to accept and close the deal."
