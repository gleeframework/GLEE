{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than my minimum:** I'm making sure I get at least my minimum value.
* **Below Bob's value:** This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to accept.
* **Not too low:** This shows I'm confident in the value of my product. 

I'll be ready to negotiate further if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm not desperate to sell, so I'm going to try to push for a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $11,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This counteroffer is:

* **Above my minimum:**  I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Below Bob's offer:** I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Reasonable:** It's a fair price that should be appealing to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,750? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still slightly below my minimum value, but it's getting closer.  Considering the time spent negotiating and the risk of losing the sale entirely, I'm going to accept his offer. It's a decent profit and I'm confident I can find a better deal in the future."
