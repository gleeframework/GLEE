"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is closer to my maximum price than it is to her minimum. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? This would give us both a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to my price, and this offer is a reasonable compromise. It's not worth the risk of her backing out or me losing out to another buyer by continuing to negotiate."
