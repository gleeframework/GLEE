"I have a unique and valuable product that I'm excited to offer to you. I think it's worth discussing a price of $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product is only worth $12,000 to me, and I know you'd like to get a fair price for it. How about we start around $10,000?  I'm hoping we can find some middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we discuss a price of $14,000? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it's still a good deal for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000.  This would be a good deal for me while still giving you a fair price above my maximum.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss a price of $16,000? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it's a good opportunity for you to get a great deal.",16000.0,Alice,5,
