"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum price point of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. I'm offering $9,000, which is still a good deal for her, as she values the product at $10,000. This gives us room to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $11,000 is still above my target price of $10,000.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $10,500, which is halfway between my target price and Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still keeping my budget in mind. This offer also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
