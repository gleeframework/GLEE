,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
