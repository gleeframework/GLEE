Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting closer to my ideal price point, but I believe I can still get a slightly better deal.  The offer is not significantly lower than my last counteroffer, so I'm not under pressure to accept immediately. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1110000}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer is a small increase from my previous offer, but still below Alice's last offer.  It shows that I'm committed to negotiating a fair price but also recognizes that Alice is likely to accept a deal closer to her minimum value.  It's a last attempt before considering John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is now just slightly above my last counteroffer. While I'd prefer to get it down even further, it's getting close to my ideal price point. With only 3 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation potentially pushing Alice to walk away and the possibility of having to buy from John at a significantly higher price is too great.  It's time to accept and finalize the deal."
