Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have room to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is polite and invites Bob to share his thoughts, leaving room for negotiation if he pushes back.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a chance to buy the product."
