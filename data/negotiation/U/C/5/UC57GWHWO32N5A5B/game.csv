"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $18000. Would that be something you'd be interested in?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $16000. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $13500. That's the most I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I want to go any lower than $16000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I can meet you at $14500. That's the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $14500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a final offer of $13000. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll make the deal. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $10000",13000.0,Bob,8,
