"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to invest a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This would still give you a substantial profit and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows for a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
