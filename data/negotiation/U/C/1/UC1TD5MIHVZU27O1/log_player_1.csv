Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $9,500 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so he has room to negotiate down from this offer.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This price shows that you're willing to negotiate but also value the product. 

Remember, you can always make counteroffers based on Bob's responses and adjust your strategy accordingly. You have the option to sell to John at any time if negotiations with Bob are not fruitful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell at $9500. However, I am only able to pay up to $9000 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, there's still some room for negotiation. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer to see if you can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $9,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
