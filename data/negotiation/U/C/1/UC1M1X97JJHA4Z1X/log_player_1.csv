"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $150, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $175 is better than my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe the product is worth more, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $190. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial target. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but if not, we can continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $180 is getting closer to my desired price, and we're already halfway through the rounds.  I'd rather not risk losing the deal by continuing to haggle, especially since selling to John would only net me $150.  It's time to accept and move on."
