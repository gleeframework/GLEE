"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 might be a bit high for your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. While I appreciate you coming down, $8,500 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Could you do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $9,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is my final counteroffer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
