"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's work together to find a solution.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a good compromise, and it allows us both to get a fair deal.  Let's close this deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me on this.  I know we're close. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,
