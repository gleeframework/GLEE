"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1200000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1000000. Would you be willing to consider that? I'm confident this product has great potential, and I'm eager to make this deal work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'm not quite ready to go any lower. I'm now offering the product to you for $1075000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product brings. What are your thoughts?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
