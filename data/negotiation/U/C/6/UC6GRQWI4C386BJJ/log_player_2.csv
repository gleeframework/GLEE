Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're still quite far apart on price.  While I value your interest, I need to stay closer to my original valuation. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000, but I can't go any lower.  This is a final offer.

It's time to cut bait. Alice has made it clear she is unlikely to go below $1,000,000, and her ""final offer"" tactics are getting old.  It's better to secure the product at John's price than to risk further negotiation rounds."
