"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'm not willing to go above $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? This reflects the true value of the product.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair price for the product, but $8,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $7,750. Would you be willing to consider that?",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $7,750 is still a bit low for me considering its value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $8,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,5,
