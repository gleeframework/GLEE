"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better deal than John's offer, Bob can likely get a lower price by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to explore if Alice is willing to drop her price further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the lowest price possible.  While $13,000 is better than John's offer, Bob can likely still negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
