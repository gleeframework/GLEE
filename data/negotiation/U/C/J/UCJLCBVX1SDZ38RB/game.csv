"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, given its value to me.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still slightly higher than my ideal price point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This offer reflects a substantial savings for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
