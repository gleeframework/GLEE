Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me. This is a common tactic in negotiation to leave room for potential compromise. Since John is willing to pay $100, I have some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, while still being closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
