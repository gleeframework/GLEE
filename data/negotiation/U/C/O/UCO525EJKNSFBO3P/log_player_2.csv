"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,600,000. I know it's a valuable asset for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still being competitive.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Even though Alice believes the price is competitive, it is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  He can get the product from John for a lower price."
