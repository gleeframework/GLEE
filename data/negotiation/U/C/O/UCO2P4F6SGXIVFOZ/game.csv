"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13500 just yet. I'm willing to come down to $14200, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",14200.0,Alice,3,,

"I can see you're making a strong push for the deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13500 and $14200, which is $13850. However, I'm not quite comfortable going that low. I'll make a compromise and meet you at $13900. What do you think?",13900.0,Alice,5,,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I appreciate the slight increase to $13950. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'm not going to give away the value of the product without getting a better price. I'll make one more concession and meet you at $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,7,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $13900, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13800.0,Bob,8,,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit stuck, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13800. I'll make one final counteroffer to meet you in the middle between $13800 and $14000, which is $13900. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",13900.0,Alice,9,,
