"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'm not willing to go as high as $200. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. However, $120 is too low for me. Could you do $170? That's a significant reduction on my initial price.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider $140? I think that's a fair compromise.",140.0,Bob,4,
