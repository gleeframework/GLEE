Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification for the Price:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product helps justify the price tag, even though it's above Bob's perceived value.
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" can create a sense of urgency and desirability.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:**  It's unclear how price-sensitive Bob is. If he's very risk-averse, a lower offer might be more successful.
* **Negotiation Potential:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can always adjust your price closer to $1,200,000 if needed, knowing you have John as a backup."
