"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $14,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, but he should be prepared to walk away and buy from John if the price doesn't come down."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. It's worth another counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down further. If not, Bob can always buy from John for a guaranteed price."
