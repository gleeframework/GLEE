Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he might get a ""deal.""
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, Alice provides a reason for the seemingly high price, making it less likely to scare Bob away immediately.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is open-ended, suggesting Alice is willing to discuss the price further if Bob shows interest.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If she's highly risk-averse, she might offer a price closer to $10,000 to ensure a sale.
* The success of this offer also depends on Bob's personality and negotiation skills."
