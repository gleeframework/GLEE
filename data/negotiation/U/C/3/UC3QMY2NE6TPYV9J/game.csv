"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're sticking to your offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $10200. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $10200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't regret.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10500. This is a very good price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
