Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $18,000.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is there any wiggle room in your price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although it's tempting to go with the guaranteed $12,000 from John, I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price from Bob.  There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $15,000. This still allows me to make a fair profit and I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $13,500 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and significantly closer to my initial asking price than John's offer."
