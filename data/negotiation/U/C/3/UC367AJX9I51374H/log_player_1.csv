"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,450,000. This is a significant amount lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives him room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price. I'm aiming to find a middle ground where we both feel comfortable with the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,375,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his previous offer. I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough for him to consider, but still allows me to earn a good profit."
