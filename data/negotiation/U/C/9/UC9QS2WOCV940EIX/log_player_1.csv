Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and still being appealing to Bob. Here's why:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You want to get at least $8,000, and this offer ensures that.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so he has a $500 potential gain by accepting. This gives him incentive to buy.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters with a lower offer, you have some room to negotiate."
