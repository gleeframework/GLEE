"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price of $12,000 is more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
