"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to make a generous offer and sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I agree this product would be valuable for my business, but I think $1,200,000 is a little steep.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value it will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,050,000? I think that's a fair offer that acknowledges the product's value.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
