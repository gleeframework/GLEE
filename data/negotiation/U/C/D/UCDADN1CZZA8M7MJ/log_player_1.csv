Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high but reasonable starting point:** I'm aiming slightly below the product's value to you ($1,500,000) but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). 
* **Creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity:** By mentioning another interested buyer (John), I'm encouraging Bob to act quickly and consider the deal seriously.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
