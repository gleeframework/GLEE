"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident this price reflects its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while leaving a good profit margin. I'm being optimistic in the hopes of closing the deal quickly, but I'm prepared to use the remaining rounds for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $800,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I understand that negotiations take time, I'm not willing to accept a price that drastically undervalues my product.  I will continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is far below the value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. That's a significant investment on my part and demonstrates how serious I am about acquiring this product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is an improvement, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000. I have limited rounds remaining, and I'm not sure if further negotiations with Bob will lead to a satisfactory outcome.  I'm considering selling to John, but I want to see if I can push Bob further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To be honest, I'm starting to think this negotiation isn't going anywhere. However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll accept $1,100,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's the absolute lowest I can go. If you're truly serious about acquiring this product, this is your last chance."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
