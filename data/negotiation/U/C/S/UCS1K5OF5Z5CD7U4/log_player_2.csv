"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you! If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the sale. If not, I'll be selling it to someone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is bluffing. She knows you have an alternative option with John, and her statement about selling it to someone else is likely a tactic to pressure you.
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away and go with John's offer. 
* This might lead Alice to propose a counteroffer closer to her own valuation of $12,000, giving you a chance to save more money."
