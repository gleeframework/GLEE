This offer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's valuation, but it leaves me some room to negotiate. Since I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John, I don't need to accept anything below $1,000,000. This strategy gives Bob a better deal than John, but still allows me to maximize my potential profit."
