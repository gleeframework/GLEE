"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than her own valuation of the product, it's still more expensive than what Bob can get from John.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most financially beneficial option for Bob."
