"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. By rejecting the offer, you can explore if Alice is willing to lower her price. You also have the option to buy from John if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $80 represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This shows Alice that you are serious about buying the product but are also looking for a good deal. It's a good starting point for negotiation."
