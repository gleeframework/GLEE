"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than it is to me. I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire an asset of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You can likely get a better price by negotiating.  There's no immediate need to buy from John as you have 10 rounds to work with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is still too high. We should continue to negotiate and aim for a price closer to our initial counteroffer of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $1,000,000.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's finalize the deal!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, but I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be worth far more to your business in the long run. How about we meet halfway at $1,100,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on $1,100,000.  While you could keep negotiating, there's a good chance she won't budge further.  Buying from Alice for $1,100,000 is still significantly cheaper than buying from John for $1,500,000, and it allows you to secure the product.  Additionally, with only 5 rounds left, continuing to negotiate risks running out of time."
