"I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and I pay $12,500?  That's still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit of wiggle room in my budget. ",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $14,000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $13,500. That's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. ",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll meet you at $14,000, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer on that price point.",14000.0,Alice,5,
