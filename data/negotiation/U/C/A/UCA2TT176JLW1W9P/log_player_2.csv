# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1400000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further negotiation if you're willing to consider it.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $1300000.
