"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth $1,500,000 to me. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $925,000? That's a pretty significant investment for me."", ""product_price"": 925000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $925,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the best compromise I can make, considering the product's true value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and getting stuck above $1,000,000 isn't worth the risk.  It's time to cut the negotiation short and go with John's guaranteed offer."
