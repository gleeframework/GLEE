```

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your willingness to work towards a deal. I'm motivated to sell, but $10,000 is too low for me to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a substantial price drop and reflects my desire to close this deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase and I want to find a solution.  However,  I need a price that reflects the true value of this product.  My final offer is $12,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
