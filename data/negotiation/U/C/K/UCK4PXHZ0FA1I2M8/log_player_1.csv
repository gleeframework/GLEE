"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to capitalize on his potential desire to acquire it. It's important to be assertive while also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can reach a fairer price. How about we discuss $750,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not comfortable with that price. It's significantly lower than the product's true value. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would still be a good deal for you and allow me to get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, how about we aim for $800,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would have preferred a higher price, accepting this offer ensures I get the value I need for the product and avoid the risk of a protracted negotiation."
