"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $800,000 is certainly below my asking price, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This price reflects the true value of the product, and it's a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $800,000. Would you consider $900,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm always open to finding a solution that works for both of us. However, $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go down to $950,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. Let's consider this a final offer, as I'm very confident this product will be incredibly valuable to your business.",950000.0,Alice,5,
