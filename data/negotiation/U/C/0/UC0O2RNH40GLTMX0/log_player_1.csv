Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $19,000, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, you can gauge his level of interest. If he's willing to negotiate down from $19,000, it indicates strong interest.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000. This knowledge allows you to be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Relationship:** If you value a long-term relationship with Bob, you might adjust your opening price to be slightly less aggressive.
* **Market Conditions:**  Understanding the current market demand for your product can influence your pricing strategy."
