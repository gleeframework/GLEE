Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $140 is greater than your minimum price of $120.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $140 is less than Bob's valuation of $150, giving him incentive to buy.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can potentially negotiate a higher price. 

Remember, this is just the first step in the negotiation.  You'll need to be flexible and adapt based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is above your minimum, it's still below your initial asking price.  There's room for negotiation.  You can potentially get closer to your desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $135? "", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit below that. How about $132? I'm really interested in the product, and I'd like to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While a little lower than you'd hoped for, $132 is still a good price considering Bob's initial offer and your minimum.  It's important to weigh the potential for further negotiation against the risk of Bob walking away or you settling for the lower price with John. In this case, it's likely worth accepting Bob's offer and securing the sale."
