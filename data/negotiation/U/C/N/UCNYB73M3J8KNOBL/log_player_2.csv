"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than what John is offering, you can potentially get a better deal. You can counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might accept a price closer to your ideal range, which would save you more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $120. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and  forces Alice to consider a lower price. It's also still within my budget of $150, so there's room for negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $130 is still within my budget, and it's a better deal than buying from John for $150.  While I would ideally want a lower price, there's a risk of further negotiation leading to a stalemate or Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price and avoid the potential of a worse outcome."
