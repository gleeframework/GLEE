"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $10,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make $16,000 to make it worth my while. Can we discuss further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than the initial one, it's still above my budget. There's still room to negotiate, and I'm willing to try and get closer to my desired price.  The risk of rejecting Alice's offer is manageable, as I can always buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going down to $13,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $14,500 to make this deal worthwhile. Can we meet in the middle again, but this time at $14,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a lower price.  The risk of rejecting her offer is manageable since I have the option to buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $14,250 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to the wire, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still a bit too high.  I'm willing to take the risk of rejecting her offer and try to negotiate a lower price. I still have a few rounds left, and there's a chance she might be willing to come down a bit more. If not, I can always purchase from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still above my budget. How about we settle on $12,500? This price is a good compromise for both of us and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement, Bob. I'm willing to make one last offer to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm happy to sell you the product. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, and I'm running out of rounds. It's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement. To avoid the risk of getting stuck with a higher price, it's best to go with the guaranteed option of buying from John for $10,000."
