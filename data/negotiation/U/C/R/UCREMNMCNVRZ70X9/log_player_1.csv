Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay closer to my desired price."

I'm not ready to sell to John yet as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
