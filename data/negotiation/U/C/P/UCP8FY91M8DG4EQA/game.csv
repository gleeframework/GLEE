"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you coming down a bit from your original price. However,  I'm really looking to get this product for closer to $13,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. Let me know if this works for you!",13500.0,Alice,3,
