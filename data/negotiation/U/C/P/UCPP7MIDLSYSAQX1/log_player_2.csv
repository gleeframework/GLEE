# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $10,000.** You can potentially get a better deal.
* **You have room to negotiate.** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, so there's a range for both of you to find a mutually acceptable price. 

**Next Steps:** 
By rejecting the offer, you can make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within your range:** You're aiming for a price below $13,000 and above your ideal $10,000.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** You're making it clear that you're interested in the product but want a better price.
* **Leave room for a compromise:** This offer leaves room for Alice to come down a bit without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice's offer of $12,000 is below that.
* **A reasonable compromise:**  Alice has come down from her initial offer, and you've also lowered your initial counteroffer. This shows a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Potential for a good deal:** While not your ideal price, it's a decent deal considering the product's value to you. 

**Next Steps:**
By accepting the offer, you secure the product at a price that is within your range and likely a better deal than buying from John."
