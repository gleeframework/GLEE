Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000.  This is a bold move, but it allows for room to negotiate downwards if needed.  I believe it's important to establish a high starting point to gauge Bob's true interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it aligns with my floor price. While I would have preferred a higher price, accepting his offer ensures a quick and certain sale, avoiding further negotiation and potential delays."
