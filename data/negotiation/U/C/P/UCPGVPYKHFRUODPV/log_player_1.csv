"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135.  It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and encouraging a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Could you do it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject and make a counteroffer.  I want to get as close to my minimum of $150 as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $100 is too low for me. I can go down to $120.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 120}
