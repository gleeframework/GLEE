Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  The message implies I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts and negotiating.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  By starting high, I have the best chance of getting close to my desired price.
* **Keep the negotiation going:**  A friendly tone and willingness to negotiate encourages Bob to make a counteroffer, giving me more opportunities to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Have an alternative:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $120 gives me a safety net and allows me to confidently walk away if Bob's offers are too low."
