{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10000 is significantly below the value of this product for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $17000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good investment.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $17,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm feeling more comfortable with a price closer to $13,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing I'm serious about buying the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $13000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $15000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.
