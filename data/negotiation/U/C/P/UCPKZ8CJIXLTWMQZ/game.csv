"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10000 is significantly below the value of this product for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $17000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $17000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm feeling more comfortable with a price closer to $13000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $13000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $15000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $15000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $14000. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",14000.0,Bob,6,
