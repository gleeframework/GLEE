"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1000000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer a price of $1050000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
