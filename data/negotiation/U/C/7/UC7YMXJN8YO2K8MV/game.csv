"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is below my initial asking price, I understand your position. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
