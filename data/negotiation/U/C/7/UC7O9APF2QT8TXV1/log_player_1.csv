Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's significantly better than John's offer. Accepting John's offer for $1,500,000 guarantees the best outcome at this stage."
