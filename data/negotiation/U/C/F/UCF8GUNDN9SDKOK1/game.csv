"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing a figure that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is much higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time. This is a fair price given the value I place on the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're suggesting is significantly below what I can accept. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still above my limit. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your persistence. It seems we're getting closer. While $1,400,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to consider it under one condition: [insert a potential concession from Bob, perhaps a shorter payment timeframe, an add-on service, or something else that adds value for you]. Would you be open to that?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a concession, but I'm not comfortable with that condition. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,500,000, but that's my final offer. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
