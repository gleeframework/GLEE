``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** The price is still significantly lower than my minimum value, demonstrating I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's response:** If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.

* **Room for negotiation:**  I have several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I'll propose a counteroffer closer to my desired price, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I'll aim for a price that's attractive to Bob while still maintaining a good profit for me."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. My product is unique and worth more than $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That's a fair price for both of us and lets us both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

* **Room for negotiation:**  We're only in round 4, so there's still time to negotiate a better price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Staying firm:**  I'll be careful not to lower my price too quickly, as I have John as a safety net."

```
