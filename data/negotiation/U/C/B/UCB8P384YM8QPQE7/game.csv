"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more equitable price. I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down slightly. Let's meet in the middle at $1025000. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $975000 is still too low for me. I'm prepared to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. How about we split the difference and settle at $1000000? This is a price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
