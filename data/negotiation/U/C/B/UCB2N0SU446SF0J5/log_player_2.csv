# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is selling the product for $140, while John wants $150.
* **The offer is within your budget:** Your maximum budget is $150, and Alice's offer is below that. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
