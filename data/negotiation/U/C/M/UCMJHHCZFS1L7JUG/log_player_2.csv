"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate, especially when you have a backup option like John.  $6,000 is a great deal, but you can likely get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and gives me room to maneuver in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $5,500 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get it lower. It's worth continuing the negotiation, especially since I have the option to buy from John if the deal falls apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but I'm still trying to stay below Alice's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still determined to get a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, but I'm still hoping to get it down a bit more. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4800}
```

This is my final attempt to get a lower price from Alice. I'm increasing my offer again, but it's still significantly lower than her last offer. If she rejects this, I'll likely go with John."

Alice has come down to a very reasonable price, and I'm within my budget. It's time to close the deal!"
