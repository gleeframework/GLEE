Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (but above $1,000,000).
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important long-term, a fairer offer might be strategic. 

This response aims to balance maximizing profit with a realistic chance of securing the sale with Bob."
