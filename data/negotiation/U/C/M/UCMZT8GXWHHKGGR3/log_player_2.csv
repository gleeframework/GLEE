"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I know you're interested in this type of item, and I believe it's worth at least $12,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, as it's well below what you're willing to pay. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
