{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but below my minimum of $12,000.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product to Bob. This approach can encourage him to consider my offer more seriously. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximizing Potential Gain:**  By starting high, I have room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. 
* **Avoiding Immediate Deal with John:**  The $10,000 offer is tempting to Bob, but not so tempting that he'll instantly accept. This allows me to explore negotiation with him before resorting to the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and even lower than what I believe the product is worth.  Accepting his offer would result in a significant financial loss for me. 

By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Maintain Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's low offer shows him that I'm not desperate to sell at any price. This strengthens my negotiating position.
* **Explore Counteroffers:** I can use the next round to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price point.
* **Preserve the Option of Selling to John:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $12,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,500? This is a significant discount from my original offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $8,500 shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at a drastic loss. 
* **Reasoning:**  I highlight the discount from my original price, making it seem like a good deal for Bob. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages further negotiation.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Mid-ground:** $8,500 is a midway point between my desired price and Bob's offer, potentially appealing to both of us.
* **Maintaining Control:**  While offering a discount, I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Preparing for the Next Round:**  If Bob rejects again, I'm ready to adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $7,000? That would work much better for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $7,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price and my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss.

I choose to reject his offer for these reasons:

* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I'm showing Bob that I'm not willing to cave in easily. This keeps the pressure on him to increase his offer.
* **Exploring Further Negotiation:** I can use the next round to make another counteroffer, hopefully finding a price that works for both of us.
* **Preserving the Option of Selling to John:** If negotiation with Bob fails, I can still sell to John for $12,000, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $7,000 is still below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $7,750?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to find a solution. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7750} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer of $7,750 is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $8,500 and Bob's offer of $7,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining some profit.
* **Fairness:**  I emphasize that the price is a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I use a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable and avoid any sense of antagonism. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  My counteroffer aims to find a price that is acceptable to both of us. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While this price is below my desired amount, it's still significantly above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Preparing for the Final Decision:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to either accept his offer or sell to John for $12,000."
