"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,500? This is a significant discount from my original offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $7,000? That would work much better for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $7,000 is still below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $7,750?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to find a solution. What do you think?",7750.0,Alice,5,
