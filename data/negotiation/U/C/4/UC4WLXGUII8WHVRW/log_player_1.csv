Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:** This price leaves room for compromise, allowing me to potentially meet in the middle without going below my minimum acceptable value.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer at $12,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a price that is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $8,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** I can still negotiate with Bob, potentially reaching a price closer to my target. 
* **John as a Backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer willing to pay $12,000, giving me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable accepting. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but firmly stating my minimum price.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer and his offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this is a fair price that benefits both parties.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, but maintaining a firm stance.
* **John as Safety Net:**  I still have John as a backup buyer, giving me confidence in rejecting any offers below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've been able to secure the product from another seller, John, for $8,000. I believe this is a fair price given my budget constraints. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* **No further negotiation:** Bob has revealed he has an alternative source for the product at the same price he offered me. 
* **John is the better option:** John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable value. 

It's better to sell to John and secure my minimum acceptable value."
