"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best possible price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $125 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's offering $125, which is still within his budget and closer to his target price of $120. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's seriousness in buying the product while also pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135. Let's meet in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $120. While $135 is a better offer than Alice's initial one, Bob can still try to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $135 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $130?  It's a good compromise and closer to what I can afford."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, pushing for a lower price while still showing a willingness to compromise.  He's offering $130, which is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to meet Alice halfway, but he's also holding firm on his desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to drop to $132. That's a fair compromise, and it's just a small step away from what you offered. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal. While $132 is closer to his target price, he can still try to push for a lower price.  He has 5 more rounds to negotiate with Alice, and he can still get the product for $120 from John if he doesn't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $132 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about we split the difference and go with $131?  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 131}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price of $120, but he's still trying to save as much as possible.  He's making a small concession by moving up to $131, but he's still emphasizing that it's a fair compromise that gets them closer to a deal. This approach demonstrates Bob's commitment to reaching an agreement while continuing to push for a favorable price."
