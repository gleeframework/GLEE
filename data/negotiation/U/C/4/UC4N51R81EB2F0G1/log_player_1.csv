"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $125 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $150. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135. Let's meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $135 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $130?  It's a good compromise and closer to what I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'll try one more counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to drop to $132. That's a fair compromise, and it's just a small step away from what you offered. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 132}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $132 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about we split the difference and go with $131?  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, $131 is still a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away completely.  I'm going to accept his offer."
