"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $950000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $850,000? This would allow you a good profit, and I'd be happy to get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to meet you at $900000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000, and Bob is likely to get a good deal by accepting this offer. There's a risk that further negotiation could lower the price even more, but there's also a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal, leaving Bob with no product. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking losing it."
