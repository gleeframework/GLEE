"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit lower than I can go right now.  Would you be willing to meet me at $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $120. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you on the budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $110 is still a little below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $115? I think that's a fair compromise considering we're both trying to find a good deal.",115.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $112, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",112.0,Bob,6,
