"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $120 is better than $150, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to come down to $110?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still within Bob's budget of $150, and it's a better deal than buying from John. While Bob would ideally pay closer to $100, it's likely that Alice won't budge further, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the opportunity to buy the product at all. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking a higher cost with John."
