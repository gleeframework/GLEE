"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your initial thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $2,300,000 is far too high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it represents a fair starting point for our negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. To move forward, I'm willing to drop my price significantly to $1,900,000. This reflects my commitment to getting this deal done, but it also acknowledges the true value of this product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to get a good price, but $1,900,000 is still well above my budget.  I'm committed to making this deal work, but I need to stay within my financial limitations.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. This offer reflects the value I see in the product and a fair compromise for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
