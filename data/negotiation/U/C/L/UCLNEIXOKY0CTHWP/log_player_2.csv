# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

While $140 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. She might come back with a lower price. If not, you can always buy from John for $150."
