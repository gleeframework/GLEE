{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's a valuable asset and I believe it would be a great addition to your operations. My asking price is $1,400,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm leaving myself some space to go lower if necessary, but I'm not going to give it away. I'm also confident in selling to John as a backup option, which gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I really believe this product would be a great fit for my operations, but I have to be mindful of our budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer. I'm still confident in my ability to sell to John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is too far below my asking price to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within our budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I've already made concessions, and it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement. John is a sure thing, and I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a much lower price."
