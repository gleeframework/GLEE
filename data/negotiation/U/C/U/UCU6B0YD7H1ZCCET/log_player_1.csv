"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Friendly opening:** I'm opening with a friendly message to build rapport and establish a positive tone.
* **Asking for feedback:** By asking ""What do you think?"", I encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my desired price than John's offer of $80.  I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get closer to the $100 mark. 
* **More rounds available:** With 9 rounds remaining, I have time to continue the negotiation without the pressure of a potential time limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for $90. How about we split the difference at $95? I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm counteroffering with $95, which is exactly halfway between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows a willingness to compromise and reach a middle ground.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth the investment, emphasizing its value to encourage him to close the deal.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While this is closer to Bob's offer, there's still room for negotiation if he counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $95, which would be $92.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target price:** Bob's offer of $92.50 is very close to my desired price range, and it's more than what I would get from John ($80).
* **Negotiation fatigue:** As we're already in round 4, there's a chance that continued negotiation could lead to more back and forth without a clear advantage for me. 
* **Risk of lower offer:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he might become less willing to negotiate and offer a lower price in the next round. 

Accepting Bob's offer secures a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
