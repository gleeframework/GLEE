"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $22,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $10,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's my absolute maximum. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
