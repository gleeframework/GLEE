"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10000 to make this worthwhile. How about $10500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10500. How about $9750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, at $10125.  This would allow us both to come to an agreement that is fair and mutually beneficial. What do you think?",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9900, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9900.0,Bob,6,
