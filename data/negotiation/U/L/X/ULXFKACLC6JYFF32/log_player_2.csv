{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,500 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so he's offering a price slightly above that, hoping to close the deal quickly while still getting a good price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than what he'd ideally like to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a lower price. He should reject the offer and continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,500 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, there's still potential to lower the price.  It's worth rejecting the offer and trying one more counteroffer to see if Bob can get a better price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

This is Bob's final attempt to get a good price. He's offering $13,500, which is the middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows Alice that he's willing to meet halfway and increases the likelihood of a deal. If Alice rejects, Bob can then choose to purchase from John at $15,000, which is still within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is now at Bob's maximum budget.  While continuing to negotiate might be tempting, it's unlikely Alice will budge further.  Buying from John for $15,000 guarantees Bob gets the product and avoids any further haggling."
