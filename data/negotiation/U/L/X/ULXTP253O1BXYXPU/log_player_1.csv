Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm asking for $110 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  I'm offering the product at $110, knowing it's worth $80 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Be positive:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to Bob.
* **Leave room for counteroffers:** While I'm aiming for $110, I'm open to negotiation, so I'm not stating this is my ""final offer.""

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've earned a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter with a lower price, all while keeping in mind John's offer of $100 as my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay up to $95 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $95 is better than $80 (what the product is worth to Bob), it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $100, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer.
* **Opportunity to counter:** I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'll start with a counteroffer closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price between $95 and $100, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm happy to work with you on the price, but I need to be at least $98 to make this work.  Let me know if that's a possibility for you."", ""product_price"": 98} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter close to my minimum:** I'm proposing $98, which is only $3 below my minimum acceptable price of $100. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want a fair deal.
* **Maintain positive tone:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** By not stating this is my ""final offer,"" I keep the door open for Bob to counter again.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll have a successful sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter again, keeping in mind that John's offer of $100 is always an option."
