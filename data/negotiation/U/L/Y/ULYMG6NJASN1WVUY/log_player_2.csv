Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget. It's more advantageous to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can use your knowledge of your maximum budget and the information from the initial offer to make a more informed counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still potentially attractive for her. This is a good starting point for negotiation, leaving room to potentially meet in the middle.  It's important to start low to maximize your savings, while still making a reasonable offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get a better price. I believe I can still get a lower price from Alice, as she is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has shown she's willing to come down in price.  This counteroffer is a compromise, significantly lower than her last offer but still higher than my ideal price. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also leaving room for further concessions if necessary.  It's a strategic move to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous ones, it's still higher than my maximum budget.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will eventually come down to a price that is acceptable to me.  It's better to secure the product at a price I am comfortable with rather than risking further rounds of negotiation that may not yield a better outcome."
