Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation but also demonstrating that you're not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, you can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  You'll need to carefully weigh the risk of losing the deal with Bob against the potential for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
``` 

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise,  meeting Bob halfway while still giving you a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my desired amount that it's worth accepting.  It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate."
