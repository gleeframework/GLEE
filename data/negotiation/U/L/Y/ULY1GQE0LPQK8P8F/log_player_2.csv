"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, however, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I can come down to $17,000. This is a very competitive offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to make a final offer at $14,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's more than fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $14,000. Buying from John for $12,000 ensures you get the product at the best possible price for you."
