"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,500 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like to go. To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I value our conversation and believe you'd be a great owner for this product. Would you be willing to consider $16,000? This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty about the other buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",14500.0,Bob,6,
