,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $140? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $160. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $155?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $155. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $165. It's a fair price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",165.0,Alice,5,
