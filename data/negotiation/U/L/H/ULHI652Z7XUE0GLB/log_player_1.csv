Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob if he tries to counter-offer. 
* **Balance:** This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still potentially attractive compared to losing out on the product. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter, or he might decline outright. You have the security of John's offer, so you can be firm on your price if needed."
