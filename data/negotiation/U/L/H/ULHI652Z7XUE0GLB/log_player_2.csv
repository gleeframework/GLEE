"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You know you can get the product for a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you keep the negotiation open and can see if she'll lower her price closer to your ideal range."
