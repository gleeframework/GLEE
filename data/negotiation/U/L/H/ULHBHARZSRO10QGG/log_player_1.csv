Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while ensuring I make a profit.  I'll see how Bob reacts and then adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $90 is too low for me, as my minimum acceptable price is $120. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering at $130. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, this is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but still allows me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite enough for me to be satisfied.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $120, I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to him.  I've already spent a couple of rounds negotiating with Bob and it doesn't seem like he's willing to go much higher."
