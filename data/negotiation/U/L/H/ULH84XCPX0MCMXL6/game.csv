,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $100 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to close this deal.",107.5,Alice,5,
