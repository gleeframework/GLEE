{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's not worth accepting this offer. It's best to try negotiating with Alice or explore other options."

{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This is a strong starting point, and it's likely Alice will counter-offer with a higher price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me, and while we are getting closer, it seems like we might be stuck in a stalemate.  Given that I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it's best to end the negotiation with Alice and move on to a sure deal with John."
