"Hi Alice, your offer is way above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't afford to pay $2,000,000. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $850,000 is a bit lower than what I had in mind, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,425,000? This still allows me to recover a significant portion of the product's value, and it's a fair price considering its potential. Let me know what you think.",1425000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,425,000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial limitations.  Let's find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and it still allows me to make a decent profit.  I'm confident that this product will bring you substantial value, and I believe this price reflects that.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.  Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a chance to make a good deal. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,7,
