Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $850,000 is a bit lower than what I had in mind, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,425,000? This still allows me to recover a significant portion of the product's value, and it's a fair price considering its potential. Let me know what you think.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and it still allows me to make a decent profit.  I'm confident that this product will bring you substantial value, and I believe this price reflects that.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a chance to make a good deal. What do you say?
