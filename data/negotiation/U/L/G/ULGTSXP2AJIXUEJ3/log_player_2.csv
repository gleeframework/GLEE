"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still a bit high. Let's see if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant jump from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within my acceptable range.  I'm aiming to gauge Alice's flexibility and see if there's room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low. How about $115? That's still a good deal for you, considering it's worth $150 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject and counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I'm getting closer, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm proposing a price that splits the difference between our previous offers. This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but also standing my ground on a fair price."
