Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strong Starting Point:** Offering the product at $15,000 gives you room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Value Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the higher price. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always come down in price, knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
