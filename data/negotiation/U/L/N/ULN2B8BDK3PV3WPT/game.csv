"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $2,000,000 to you. To start the conversation, I'm offering it at $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the asset has potential, I think $1,800,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to offer $1,200,000 to start negotiations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues this asset and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this asset holds value for both of us. Let's find a middle ground. I can go up to $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I feel we're getting closer. To move things along, I'm willing to accept $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of what's on the table.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
