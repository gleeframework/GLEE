"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, as this aligns with my current financial capabilities.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While $1,100,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000 to facilitate this deal. I believe this price is fair considering the exceptional value the product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
