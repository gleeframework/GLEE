"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price. You can always buy from John if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1050000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to a price that works for me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,150,000 is closer to your budget, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You could try to counter-offer at $1,100,000.  If Alice rejects that, you can always buy from John for $1,000,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While I'm still interested in the product, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1125000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's probably in your best interest to accept Alice's offer. You've already negotiated a significant price reduction from her initial offer, and going back and forth further risks losing the deal altogether.  While you could try to counter-offer again, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is always an option, but you're already close to that price with Alice."
