Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so this price gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You are willing to sell for $1,500,000, so you have room to negotiate downwards.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  A direct offer helps start the negotiation process quickly. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my maximum budget, I'd be willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.  

While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. There's still a possibility of getting a better deal, especially since he's shown interest in the product."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to a price that works for me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While I'm still interested in the product, $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1100000. This feels like a fair price that benefits us both. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired range. I believe there is still room for negotiation and I can potentially get a better price.  

Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a tempting option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob before resorting to that."
