"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a lower price from Alice, so it's worth negotiating further.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $10,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $12,000. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, considering the product is worth $8,000 to Alice. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to accept a price closer to $10,000 rather than lose the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is only slightly better than her previous offer of $12,000. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and Alice has shown she is willing to negotiate. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price.  While buying from John is always an option, it's still more expensive than what Bob might be able to get from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  Alice has shown some flexibility in her offer, but it's still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. Offering $11,000 is a reasonable compromise, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to accept it rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still more than he'd like to pay.  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and Alice has demonstrated some flexibility. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price. 

Since John is offering the product for $15,000, Bob has a clear point of reference and can confidently negotiate with Alice, knowing he has a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been consistently trying to bring the price down and has shown a willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer of $11,500 is a compromise between Bob's previous offer of $11,000 and Alice's last offer of $13,000. It's a reasonable final attempt to reach an agreement, given Bob's goal of saving as much money as possible while still securing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still higher than Bob's desired price. While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, Alice's counteroffers have not been significantly decreasing. It's clear that Alice is not willing to budge much further, and continuing the negotiation might result in a stalemate. 

Given that John is offering the product for $15,000, which is still within Bob's budget, it's more efficient for Bob to purchase the product from John.  This avoids further negotiation and ensures a swift transaction."
