"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and allows me to secure a significant profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above her perceived value, but significantly below your maximum.  
* There's room for negotiation to get a better price. 
* You have 10 rounds, so it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This price would still allow you a substantial profit while getting me closer to my desired price point. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000.  This gives us both a good outcome. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is $950,000, which is still below your maximum value of $1,200,000. 
* This offer is a good compromise, splitting the difference from your previous counteroffer. 
* Accepting this offer saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John. 
* There are still rounds left, but further negotiation may not yield a significantly better price."
