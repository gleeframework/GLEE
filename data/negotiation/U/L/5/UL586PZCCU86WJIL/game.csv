"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This price would still allow you a substantial profit while getting me closer to my desired price point. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000.  This gives us both a good outcome. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
