"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can come to a more agreeable price. How about we aim for $1,150,000? I hope this proposal works for you.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we split the difference and go for $1,200,000? This is still a good deal for you, as it's what the product is worth to you. Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,3,
