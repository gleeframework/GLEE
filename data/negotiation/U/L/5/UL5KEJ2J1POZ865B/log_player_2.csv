"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better by counteroffering and negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his own valuation of $120 as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $75 allows for room for negotiation, and hopefully keeps Alice engaged."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $82.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as close to his own valuation of $120 as possible. While $82.5 is better than Alice's initial offer, there's still room to negotiate. It's worthwhile to counteroffer and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $80, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's valuation, but he's still trying to save some money. Offering $80 is a reasonable compromise that shows he's serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is a fair price for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to go up to $85, which is still a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $85 is a good deal for Bob.  He values the product at $120 and can save $35 by accepting. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might not budge and he'd end up paying John $120.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets a good price and avoids unnecessary risk."
