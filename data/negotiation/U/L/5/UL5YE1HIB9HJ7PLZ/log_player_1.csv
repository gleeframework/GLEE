Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this to be a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, starting high leaves room for negotiation and potential profit beyond Bob's perceived value. 
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a strong safety net. Alice doesn't need to desperately accept a low offer from Bob.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** The message aims to engage Bob in a discussion rather than a simple ""take it or leave it"" scenario. This allows Alice to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher price."
