"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still quite a bit below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $11,000? This would give us both a good deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but I'm still not convinced that $11,000 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000, so I'm offering $10,250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to be flexible, $10,250 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $10,750. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $10,750 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $10,600. This feels like a fair compromise that respects both our needs. What do you think?",10600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've made a serious offer of $10,500, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to come to an agreement, and I'm starting to think about buying the product from John for $8,000. Can you meet me at $10,500 or is that a non-negotiable price?",10500.0,Bob,8,
