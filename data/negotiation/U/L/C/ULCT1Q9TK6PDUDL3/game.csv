"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $83.75?",83.75,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're committed to finding a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but $83.75 isn't quite there yet. Let's try $85.  I think this is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the price.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $85. How about $82.50?",82.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here. $82.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $84, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested at that price, I'm going to have to move on.",84.0,Alice,7,
