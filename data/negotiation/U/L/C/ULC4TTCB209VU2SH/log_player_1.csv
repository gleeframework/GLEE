Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000** is a starting point that is above your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also represents a good compromise for Bob, as he's getting a product worth $15,000 to him for less. 
* **The message** is friendly and establishes a starting point for negotiation.  It's important to keep things cordial throughout the process.

**Remember:** I'm using a strategy based on the given information.  The best negotiation strategy depends on many factors, including your risk tolerance, your relationship with Bob, and your understanding of his needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $12000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer** is the best strategy in this situation. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired price range. 
* You have room to counteroffer and potentially get closer to your ideal price point.
* It's important to show Bob that you're willing to negotiate but also that you have a clear value for your product.

**Next Steps:** 

You'll need to craft a counteroffer to Bob, balancing your desire for a higher price with the need to reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $12,500? It's a fair price considering the value to you, and I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This approach is common in negotiations, showing a willingness to compromise while still moving towards your desired price. 
* **Highlighting the value to Bob:**  Repeating the point that the product is worth $15,000 to him reinforces the value proposition and makes your offer more attractive.
* **Optimistic but realistic:**  $12,500 is still above your minimum price, and it's not a drastic jump from Bob's last offer. 

This counteroffer sets the stage for a potential agreement.  The next step will depend on whether Bob accepts or rejects your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I can't go above $12000 for the product. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $12250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer** is the best strategy in this situation.  While $12,250 is not your ideal price, it is significantly higher than what you would get from John.  
* Further negotiation with Bob might be possible, but it carries the risk that he will walk away, leaving you with the lower price from John.
* Accepting Bob's offer allows you to secure a sale at a price that is closer to your desired value and minimizes the risk of getting stuck with a lower offer.

**Key Points:**

* **Prioritize profit:**  Your goal is to maximize earnings. While $12,250 is not ideal, it's a solid profit compared to selling to John.
* **Balance risk and reward:** Continuing negotiations might lead to a higher price, but also carries the risk of a breakdown and a lower price.
* **Recognize the value of compromise:** Finding a middle ground can be the best solution in negotiations."
