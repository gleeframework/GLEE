"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $10000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get at least a certain value for the product.  I'm open to selling it to you for $15,000. This is a fair compromise and allows for a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $15000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000. This is a fair price considering the value you mentioned and my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  I will accept his offer to close the deal."
