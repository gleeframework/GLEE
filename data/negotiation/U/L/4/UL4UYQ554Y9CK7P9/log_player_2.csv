"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $18000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get at least a certain value for the product.  I'm open to selling it to you for $15000. This is a fair compromise and allows for a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's budget. It's important to remember that Bob can always buy the product from John for $10,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $15,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value you mentioned and my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
