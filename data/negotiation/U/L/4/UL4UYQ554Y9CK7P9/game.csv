"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $10000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get at least a certain value for the product.  I'm open to selling it to you for $15000. This is a fair compromise and allows for a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $15000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000. This is a fair price considering the value you mentioned and my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
