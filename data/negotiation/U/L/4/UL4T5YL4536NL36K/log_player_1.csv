Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $10,000 sets a high initial anchor point for the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Signaling flexibility encourages Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John's offer provides a safety net, allowing me to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not enough:** While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I ideally want. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** Rejecting allows for another round of negotiation, potentially leading to a better price.
* **John's offer as a floor:** I can still sell to John for $8,000, so I have room to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,750 is my best price right now.  Let me know if you're interested in that."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Strong but Fair:**  The price is still within a reasonable range, potentially appealing to Bob.
* **Avoiding Deadlock:**  By offering a price closer to Bob's, I hope to avoid further rounds of rejection and maintain the negotiation momentum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:**  $9,600 is only $100 less than my previous counteroffer and is very close to my desired price point.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Another round of negotiation might lead to a lower price, potentially dropping below my minimum.
* **Time and Effort:**  The negotiation has already gone back and forth a few times. Accepting avoids further back-and-forth and secures a good price. 
* **Secure Sale:** Accepting ensures a sale and avoids the risk of Bob walking away completely."
