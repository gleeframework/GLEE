"Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible.  Since both Alice and John are selling the product for the same price ($800,000), you have no incentive to accept Alice's offer.  You can reject it and buy from John, achieving the same outcome at the same price."
