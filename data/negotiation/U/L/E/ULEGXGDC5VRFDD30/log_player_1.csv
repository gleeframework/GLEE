"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than it is to me.  To kick off our negotiation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. This feels like a fair starting point given its potential value to you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High but Reasonable Opening:** Starting high ($1,150,000) anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob helps justify the high price and frames the negotiation in terms of mutual benefit.
* **Leaving Room for Movement:** Alice understands this is just the first round and is prepared to negotiate further, potentially lowering her price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your starting point, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than both Alice's starting price and the product's value to Bob. By rejecting this offer, Alice signals that she's serious about getting a price closer to her product's worth. She's willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, but $950,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,075,000? This acknowledges the value it brings while recognizing there's room for negotiation on both sides."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection + Compromise:** Alice clearly rejects Bob's lowball offer but proposes a compromise by significantly reducing her initial ask.
* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** The new price ($1,075,000) is slightly closer to Alice's minimum than Bob's offer, aiming to move the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome for her.
* **Maintaining Value Emphasis:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its worth and justifying a price above his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,075,000. How about $1,012,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,012,500 is slightly above Alice's guaranteed sale price with John ($1,000,000), it's a reasonable compromise at this stage of the negotiation.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate aggressively risks souring the deal with Bob. There's no guarantee Alice can get a significantly better offer from him.
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation has a cost. Accepting now ensures a good profit and allows Alice to move on to other potential deals.
* **Building Goodwill:** Accepting Bob's compromise might lead to a more positive business relationship in the future."
