"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than it is to me.  To kick off our negotiation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. This feels like a fair starting point given its potential value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your starting point, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, but $950,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,075,000? This acknowledges the value it brings while recognizing there's room for negotiation on both sides.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,075,000. How about $1,012,500?",1012500.0,Bob,4,
