"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree this product could be a great fit, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $9,500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $8,200. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm still finding it hard to justify anything above $7,000 for this product. Would that price point work for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to sell the product for $7,800. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate.  $7,800 is closer, but to be honest, anything above $7,500 is pushing it for me.  How about we settle at $7,500 and call it a deal?",7500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product for $7,600. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",7600.0,Alice,7,
