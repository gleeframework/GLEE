{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit lower than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to find a middle ground between our valuations.  

I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll have to consider if I want to counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. It's not even close to what I'm willing to accept.  

I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. I'll also factor in the risk of John potentially changing his mind or finding another deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $12,500 is my absolute bottom line.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise.  It's still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to his valuation. It gives him a chance to accept without feeling too pressured, and it allows me to potentially earn more than if I accepted his initial offer.  

I'm also factoring in the potential deal with John. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'm ready to sell to John."
