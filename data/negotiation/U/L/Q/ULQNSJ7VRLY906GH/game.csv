"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $82 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $78. Let's try to make this happen. ",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $78 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $80.50. It's my lowest price, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you think?",80.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $80.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about $80? This is my final offer, and I'm ready to buy if you accept.",80.0,Bob,6,
