Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. This product would be useful, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $13,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but $13,000 is still pushing my budget.  I could potentially do $9,000. Would that work for you?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing the value you place on this product, but to be fair, $9,000 is still quite a ways off. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference between $11,500 and $10,250? That puts us at $10,875. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

At this point, Alice seems unlikely to go down to $10,000. It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John and save the extra $875 than to risk Alice not budging further."
