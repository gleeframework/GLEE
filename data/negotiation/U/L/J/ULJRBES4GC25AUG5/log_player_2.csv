"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think is a great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $900,000, which is significantly less than John's price of $1,500,000. 
* **You still get a good deal:** While you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, accepting her offer still saves you $600,000 compared to buying from John."
