{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** $14,000 is above your $12,000 floor.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still room for Bob to negotiate down, but it's close enough to his perceived value to make it tempting.
* **It shows you're serious about a deal:** You're not starting with a ridiculously high price, making you seem more reasonable and open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't exceed $13,000 for it. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still potential to get closer to my ideal price of $14,000. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, I'm still a little higher than $13,000. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find it a good value."", ""product_price"": 13500}
