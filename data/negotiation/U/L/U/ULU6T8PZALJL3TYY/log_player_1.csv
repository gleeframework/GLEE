{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point above your minimum, leaving room to negotiate downwards if necessary. The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the details you've provided. Given my budget constraints, I am willing to pay up to $8000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is my minimum, Bob's offer meets that minimum, and it's likely that further negotiation will not lead to a higher price."
