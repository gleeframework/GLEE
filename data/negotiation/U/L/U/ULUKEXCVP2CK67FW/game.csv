"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? That would be a comfortable price point for me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.",10000.0,Alice,3,
