"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16500. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16500 is still a bit out of my range. My absolute maximum is $15000.  I'm confident this is a fair price given the value we both agree on. Let's see if we can make this work.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $15000.

Let me know if you're interested.",16000.0,Alice,5,
