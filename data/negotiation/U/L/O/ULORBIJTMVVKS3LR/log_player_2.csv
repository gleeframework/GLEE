Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1200000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated. Let's meet in the middle at $1350000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. While I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my asking price, $1275000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering a final counteroffer of $1300000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the value you'll receive from this product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting close to a deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1290000 simply doesn't cover my costs. Let's meet in the middle at $1295000.
