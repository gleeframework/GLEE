"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm a bit of a budget buyer, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go.",14000.0,Bob,4,
