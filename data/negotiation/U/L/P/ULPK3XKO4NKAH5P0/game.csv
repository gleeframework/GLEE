"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my understanding of the product's value and market comparisons, I'd like to offer $1,250,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us, allowing for a profitable transaction. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $1,250,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway and lower my price to $1,325,000. This reflects my desire to reach a fair agreement while still acknowledging the product's true worth.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000. This price reflects a fair value for both parties and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to find a solution that meets both our needs.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I've considered your position carefully.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I also value closing this deal swiftly. Let's settle this now - $1,275,000. This is my final offer, reflecting a compromise for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
