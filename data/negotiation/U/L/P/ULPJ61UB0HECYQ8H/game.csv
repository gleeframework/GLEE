"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, given its value to me.  I believe this price is fair, considering I'm willing to close the deal immediately. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,250,000 is not a price I can accept at this time.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,350,000.  This is a price that is fair to both of us, given the value of the product to you.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to negotiate in good faith.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's finalize the deal at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1,300,000 is still not a price I can accept.  I'm prepared to compromise and offer the product for $1,325,000. This is a small concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
