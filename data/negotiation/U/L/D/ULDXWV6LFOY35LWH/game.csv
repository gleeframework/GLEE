"Bob, I believe this product represents a fantastic opportunity for you.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,200,000.  I'm confident this is a price that reflects its worth.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but it's not worth that much in my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and the benefits it offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my best offer and reflects the true value of what you're getting.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere? I could go up to $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a fair deal here, but I need you to meet me closer to my price.  $750,000 is still too low. How about we settle on $1,600,000?  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I'm demonstrating my willingness to make a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're trying to find a compromise, but the gap between our valuations is still quite large. I can see this product being worth $900,000 to me, but I can't justify going any higher than that. ",900000.0,Bob,6,
