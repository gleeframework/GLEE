{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This initial offer helps me gauge his interest and potentially secure a deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $105 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a price closer to $110. I believe this is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Would you be willing to consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's counteroffer, but still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to compromise, but also maintains my bargaining position. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to justify my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $105 is a fair price. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm hoping that by continuing to negotiate, I can potentially secure a higher price, or at least make Bob come closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option of selling the product to John for $120 at any time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to go down to $110. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good opportunity for you to get a quality item. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm sticking with $110 as my counteroffer. I'm hoping that by remaining firm and emphasizing the value of the product, I can persuade Bob to accept. I'm also reminding him that he has the opportunity to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $102.50 is a fair price. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John for $120. Although I'd like to get more, Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $120 by continuing to negotiate."
