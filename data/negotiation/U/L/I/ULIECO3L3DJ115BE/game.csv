"I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to purchase the product for $1,050,000.  This price would be fair for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,075,000. I believe this price is still a great value for you, and I'm excited about the potential partnership.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
