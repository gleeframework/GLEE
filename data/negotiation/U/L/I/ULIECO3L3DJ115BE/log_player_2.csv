"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, which I believe will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. It's in Bob's best interest to try and get a lower price. By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to purchase the product for $1,050,000.  This price would be fair for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,075,000. I believe this price is still a great value for you, and I'm excited about the potential partnership. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is a fair price for Bob.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't go lower than $1,050,000, which is her counteroffer price. Buying from Alice at $1,075,000 is still a better deal than buying from John at $1,200,000.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best decision in this scenario."
