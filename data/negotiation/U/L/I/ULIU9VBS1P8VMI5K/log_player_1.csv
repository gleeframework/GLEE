""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 is still significantly attractive to Bob (a $150,000 gain for him). 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  The ""one-time offer"" and request for a prompt decision add a touch of urgency, potentially swaying Bob towards acceptance. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** Having John as a backup buyer provides a safety net, ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum acceptable price."
