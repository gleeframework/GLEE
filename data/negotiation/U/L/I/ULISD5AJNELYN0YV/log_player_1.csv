Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value. This sets the bar high and gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **No Concrete Knowledge of Bob's Value:** Since I don't know Bob's valuation, starting high allows me to explore his potential range. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me a safety net. If Bob rejects my offer, I can always fall back on John.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully observe Bob's response. If he rejects my offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer based on his proposed price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price. This suggests there's room for further negotiation.
* **Exploring Potential:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to explore if there's a higher price he might be willing to pay. 
* **Avoiding ""Settling"":** Accepting immediately would be settling for a lower price than I might be able to achieve. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer but acknowledging his willingness to pay more than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise, but not to a point where I'm significantly undervaluing the product.
* **Midpoint Approach:** It's a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's seriousness and see if he's willing to bridge the gap further. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll secure a good price. If he rejects, I'll need to assess if it's worth making further concessions or if selling to John is the better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** While Bob's offer is still lower than my preferred price, it's only a $50,000 difference from my previous counteroffer. This suggests he's not willing to go much higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away or me being forced to sell to John for a lower price. 
* **Reasonable Profit:**  $1,250,000 is still a significant profit and above my minimum acceptable value. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the transaction with Bob, ensuring the terms are clear and the payment process is smooth."
