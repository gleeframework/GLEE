"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth $100 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $125. This is a great deal, as I'm willing to sell it to someone else for more. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob values the product at $100. Alice is offering it for $125.  Bob can get the same product from John for $100.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the better financial decision."
