"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $1,050,000, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my target price of $1,100,000 or higher.  I have time and can continue to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me. I'm proposing $1,075,000. This price acknowledges your interest and allows me to reach a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,062,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close to my target and secures a sale within the limited negotiation rounds. It's a better outcome than selling to John for $1,000,000."
