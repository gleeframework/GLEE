I'm willing to come down to $1900000, which I believe is a fair price considering its unique capabilities and potential for your business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
