"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential benefits from owning it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows him to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its value,  $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to you. Considering your offer of $9,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $10,500. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his limit than what John is offering. Accepting the offer saves Bob money compared to buying from John."
