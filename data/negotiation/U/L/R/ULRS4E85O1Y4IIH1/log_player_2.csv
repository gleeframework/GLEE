# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

You should reject Alice's offer. You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my bottom line.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
