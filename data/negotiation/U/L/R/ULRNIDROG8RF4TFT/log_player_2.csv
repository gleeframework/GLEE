"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  Let's start with $750,000. I believe this is a fair price, given the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $850000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his limit of $800,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob has several rounds remaining.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue the negotiation process and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle of our last offers at $800,000.  This is a fair price, given the value of the product, and it allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $800000 to me. I'm willing to meet you at $825000, which is a compromise that still gives me some room to make a profit. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price, there's no guarantee.  Bob has already used 4 rounds and has only 6 remaining.  

At this point, buying from John for $800,000 is the best option. It guarantees Bob the product at his maximum budget, and he avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds that may not result in a lower price."
