"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  Let's start with $750000. I believe this is a fair price, given the value of the product to both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $850000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $850000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle of our last offers at $800000.  This is a fair price, given the value of the product, and it allows us both to get a good deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $800000 to me. I'm willing to meet you at $825000, which is a compromise that still gives me some room to make a profit. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
