"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'd like to counteroffer a price that's closer to my minimum, but still reasonable for you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, Alice, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet on this price.",980000.0,Bob,6,
