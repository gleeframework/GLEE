,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents the value I place on this product, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $15,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could you consider $11,500? That's a reasonable compromise, I think.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  $15,000 is really my bottom line to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I need to be closer to $12,000. I could do $12,250 as my final offer. Let me know if that works for you.",12250.0,Bob,6,
