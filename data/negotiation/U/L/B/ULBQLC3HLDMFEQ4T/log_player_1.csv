Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is quite low, and there's room for negotiation. I'll try to meet him halfway.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $15,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could you consider $11,500? That's a reasonable compromise, I think.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
