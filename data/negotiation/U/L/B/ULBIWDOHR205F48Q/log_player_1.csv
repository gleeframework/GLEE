Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that starting price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer is significantly below what I value the product at. It's worth the risk to see if I can negotiate him up.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 6
Bob's offer:

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I could try to squeeze Bob further, there's a real risk he walks away. John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price.  It's the safest and most logical choice at this point."
