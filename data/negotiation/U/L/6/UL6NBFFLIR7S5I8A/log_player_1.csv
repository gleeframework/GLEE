Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum price of $15,000. This shows good faith and encourages Bob to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the value of the product for Bob, reminding him it's worth $10,000 to him. This motivates him to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

* I want to start high enough to get a good price but low enough to encourage Bob to negotiate.
* I'm open to counteroffers, but I will always have John as a backup at $15,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and significantly lower than my initial offer of $12,000. 
* **I'm willing to negotiate:** I'm not immediately selling to John because I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,500 is too far below what I need to sell.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This demonstrates willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that $11,250 is still a good deal compared to its worth to him.
* **Open to Agreement:** I end by suggesting we reach an agreement, which encourages further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By offering a counter-offer that's a reasonable compromise, I aim to bridge the gap between our desired prices and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,250 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum price of $15,000.  It's clear that further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a price I'm comfortable with.
* **John is a Guaranteed Sale:** John's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price and guarantees a sale with no further negotiation.
* **Time is Valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing John as a buyer and potentially ending up with a lower price than John's offer.

**Strategy:**

By selling to John, I maximize my earnings and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
