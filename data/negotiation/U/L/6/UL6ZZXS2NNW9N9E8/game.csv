"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  $11,000 is still a little steeper than I'd like. How about $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product!",10500.0,Alice,5,
