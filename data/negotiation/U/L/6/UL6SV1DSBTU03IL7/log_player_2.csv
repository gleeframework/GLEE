"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's target price of $1,000,000. It's worth negotiating to see if Bob can get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,175,000 is still above Bob's target price of $1,000,000.  There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to push the price even lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,100,000, but I'm still not sure if that's enough to make it worth my while. However, I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above Bob's target price of $1,000,000, it's getting closer.  Considering that Bob can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, accepting Alice's offer is the best option.  It saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal to John is too high at this point."
