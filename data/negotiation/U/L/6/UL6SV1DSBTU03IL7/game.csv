"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my current financial situation.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,100,000, but I'm still not sure if that's enough to make it worth my while. However, I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
