Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my budget of $10,000. If you're not able to come down to that price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $12,000. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.
