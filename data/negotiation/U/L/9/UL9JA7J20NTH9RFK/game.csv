"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  How about we settle on $10,500? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,500, which would be $10,750. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",10750.0,Alice,5,
