# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $12,000. He should reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  John is offering the product at Bob's desired price, so it's the most logical choice."
