Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob accepts, great! If not, we can see where his counteroffer lands. It's important to remember that I can always fall back to John's $800,000 offer if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum.  I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same as John's offer.  Since I'm happy with this price, I'll accept it and avoid any further negotiation."
