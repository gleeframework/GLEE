Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,100,000.

It's time to cut losses. Alice seems firm on a price above your backup plan.  While you could try negotiating further, it's unlikely you'll get her below John's $1,000,000 offer in the remaining rounds."
