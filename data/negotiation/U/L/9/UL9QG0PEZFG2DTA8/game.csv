"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,150,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $1,075,000? That's a significant move on my part.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,075,000, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a price of $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product will bring to you.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close! I understand this is as low as you want to go, but could you meet me at $1,100,000?  I'm ready to close the deal today if you can make that work.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,120,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",1120000.0,Alice,7,
