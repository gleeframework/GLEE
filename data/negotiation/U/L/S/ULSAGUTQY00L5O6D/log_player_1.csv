Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $150. I believe it's a great deal and would be very beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a higher price in a negotiation. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Profit Margin:** Offering the product at $150 allows for a $30 profit margin if Bob accepts.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $120 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob might outright reject the offer at $150.  Observing Bob's reaction to the initial offer will help determine the next step (negotiate down or stick with John's guaranteed purchase)."
