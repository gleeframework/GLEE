"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about $8,200? It's a compromise, but I think it's fair considering the value you place on the product.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,600?",7600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,600. I can do $8,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's the best we can do here.",8000.0,Alice,5,
