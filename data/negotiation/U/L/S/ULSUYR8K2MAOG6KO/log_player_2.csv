"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $120. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Value to You:** The product is worth $150 to you.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is selling it for $120.
* **John's Price:** John is selling it for $150.

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $30 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, accepting her offer is the best option in this scenario."
