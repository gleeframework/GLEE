"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm confident it could significantly benefit your business. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, which is a price I believe is fair given its potential.  Of course, if this isn't the right fit for you, I have another buyer lined up who is very interested.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
