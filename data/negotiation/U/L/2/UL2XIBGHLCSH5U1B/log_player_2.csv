"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You should accept Alice's offer.  You're getting the product for $9,500, which is a better price than what John is offering and still leaves some room for profit since you value the product at $12,000."
