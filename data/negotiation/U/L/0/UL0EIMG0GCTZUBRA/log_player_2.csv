"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you! I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Reason: Bob wants to save money and $130 is more than his maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $130 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $115?  I'm really interested in the product and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you're interested and $115 is closer to what I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $125? That gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason:  Bob is still trying to save money.  While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum,  he can still try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's split the difference -  I'll offer $120, which is my absolute maximum.  This would be a win-win, as it's your asking price and within my budget."", ""product_price"": 120}
