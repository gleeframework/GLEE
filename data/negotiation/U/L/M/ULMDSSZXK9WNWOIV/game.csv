"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  I'm happy to pay $12,500, which is a good compromise for both of us.  I'm confident this product is worth it, but I need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
