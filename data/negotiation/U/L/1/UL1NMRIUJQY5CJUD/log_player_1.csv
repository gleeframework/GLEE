"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $17,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than the product's value to Bob, but not so high that it's immediately out of the question.  It leaves room for negotiation and gives me the best chance of earning the maximum amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $14,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm offering $16,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it's still above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm offering $15,500. This is my final counteroffer.  It's a compromise between my ideal price and Bob's current offer, and it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling to John. While I'm close to my desired price with Bob, it seems unlikely we'll reach a deal with only four rounds remaining.  It's better to guarantee the $15,000 from John rather than risk losing out on a sale and ending up with nothing."
