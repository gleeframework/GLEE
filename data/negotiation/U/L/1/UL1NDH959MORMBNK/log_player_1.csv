Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $9,000. This gives me a little room to negotiate if Bob counters, while still being a good price considering the product is worth $8,000 to him.  I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for less than $8,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is a compromise, still leaving some room for negotiation while ensuring I get closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me. Even though I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk going lower than my minimum value of $8,000.  I'll take John's offer and sell the product for $8,000."
