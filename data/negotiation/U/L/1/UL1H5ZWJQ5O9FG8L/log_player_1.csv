Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value is significant to you, and to reflect its importance, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Value justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more amenable to a higher price.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. How you proceed depends on Bob's response. Be prepared to negotiate, but always keep your fallback option (selling to John) in mind."
