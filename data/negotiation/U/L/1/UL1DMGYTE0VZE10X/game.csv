"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $13,000, given its exceptional quality and features.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my reach. How about $9,000?  That's a fair compromise that allows me to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  $9,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd hoped for. Could you manage $9,750? That's my final offer.",9750.0,Alice,5,
