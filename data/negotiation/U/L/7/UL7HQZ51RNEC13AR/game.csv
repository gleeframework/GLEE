,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested in my product.  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $108 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $110 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
