Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,050,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm not going to go all the way to $925,000. How about we meet at $975,000? That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's also holding firm to a price that provides her a reasonable profit. At $975,000, you're getting a significant discount from her initial offer and staying well below your $1,000,000 maximum. 

While John offers the product for $1,000,000, the difference is now marginal. It's unlikely further negotiation with Alice will yield a significantly better price, and you risk her withdrawing the offer altogether."
