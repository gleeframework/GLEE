"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I recognize the value of the product but  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be honest,  $1,050,000 is still a little high for my budget.  How about we settle at $925,000? This offer reflects my strong interest while keeping the deal within a range I can manage.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm not going to go all the way to $925,000. How about we meet at $975,000? That's as low as I'm willing to go.",975000.0,Alice,5,
