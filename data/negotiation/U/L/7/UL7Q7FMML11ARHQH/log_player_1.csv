Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start high.  This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Testing the waters:**  A price of $15,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. If he accepts immediately, you've maximized your profit. 
* **Room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can always negotiate down towards $10,000, knowing you won't be making a loss."
