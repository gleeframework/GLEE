Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe you might find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** You aim for a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but below your guaranteed selling price to John ($150). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, potentially leading to a price higher than $120 but lower than $145.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing out as you have John ready to buy at your desired minimum price."
