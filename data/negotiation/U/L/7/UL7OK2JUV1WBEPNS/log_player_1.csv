"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. My starting price is $1,750,000.  Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully settle above my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** I want to keep the conversation friendly and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Flexibility:**  The message implies I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I'm hoping we can find a price that is more within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean losing money. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, he still showed interest and is willing to negotiate. This indicates there's potential to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Exploring Options:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price. It also allows me to gauge how much higher he might be willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but this is my final offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price from the previous round, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Finality:** Stating this is my ""final offer"" adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to consider accepting. 
* **Close to Minimum:** This price is still above my minimum of $1,500,000, so I'm not risking a significant loss. 
* **Positive Tone:** Keeping the message polite helps maintain a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,550,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This is a good deal for me.
* **Time Constraint:**  It's round 4 out of 10, and every round lost brings me closer to potentially having to sell to John at my minimum price.
* **Potential for Loss:** If I keep rejecting, Bob might become frustrated and walk away, forcing me to sell to John at my minimum price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential loss of $50,000 is less risky than the potential loss of $100,000 if I continue to negotiate and Bob walks away."
