Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a middle ground, but I'm still thinking $1,200,000 is a fair price. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

**Reasoning:** Bob is firmly rooted at $1,200,000.  It's unlikely he'll budge significantly.  Rather than dragging this out and potentially getting a worse deal, it's more profitable to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000."
