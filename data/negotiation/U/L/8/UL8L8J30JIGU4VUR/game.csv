"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm very interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more around $7,000. Would that be workable for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $8,200. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",8200.0,Alice,5,
