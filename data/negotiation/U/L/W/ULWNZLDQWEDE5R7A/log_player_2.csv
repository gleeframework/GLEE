{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, I'm concerned that we might not reach a deal within the remaining rounds. The price is still significantly higher than my target of $800,000, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will get us there. 

To ensure I get the product and don't risk losing it entirely, it's more prudent to purchase from John at my maximum budget. This guarantees the purchase and avoids further potential complications."
