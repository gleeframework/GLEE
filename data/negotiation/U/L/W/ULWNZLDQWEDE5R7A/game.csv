"Thank you for your offer, Alice, but it's a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. This is my maximum, given my current resources. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the value I've placed on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for this product. This reflects the value I place on it and is a significant increase from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to get as close as possible to my minimum price.

"Alice, we're getting closer. I understand your need to get a fair price, but $975,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go at this time. I'm willing to offer $925,000.  This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal happen, but it's truly my maximum offer.  What do you say?",925000.0,Bob,6,
