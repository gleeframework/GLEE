"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value to me.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to move the product and me to get it at a price I'm comfortable with.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
