Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $18,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he negotiates, you can work towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Backup Option:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000. This knowledge gives you the confidence to aim high with Bob."
