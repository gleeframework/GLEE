"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's initial offer of $9,500 is above Bob's maximum price. 
*  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and $7,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $9,500. 
* This counteroffer is still within Bob's budget of $8,000.
* It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $8,200 is within Bob's budget and only $200 more than what he could get from John.
* Given that there are only 7 rounds left, continuing to negotiate might not be worth the risk of losing the deal altogether. 
* Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while still keeping costs relatively low."
