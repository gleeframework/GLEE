"Alice, while I appreciate the offer,  $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering my own valuation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $800000 is far below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm prepared to accept $1200000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm confident it's a fair price for this amazing product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still above my budget. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm prepared to offer $900000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value I place on the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, but $900000 still doesn't reflect its true value.  I'm willing to go down to $1000000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept it.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
