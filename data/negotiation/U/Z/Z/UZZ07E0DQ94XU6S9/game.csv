"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $8,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7200.0,Alice,3,
