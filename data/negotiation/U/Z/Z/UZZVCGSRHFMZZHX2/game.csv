"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000 for the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000? It's still a great deal for you and allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know your thoughts.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $915,000,  which is a good compromise and allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can finally close this deal.",915000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close! I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $905,000 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $910,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best chance we have to reach an agreement.  What do you say?",910000.0,Alice,7,
