"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth $10,000 at a discount. I believe this price reflects the quality and value of the product while allowing you to secure it at a favorable rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

This is a great deal! You're getting the product for $500 less than your maximum budget and $500 less than what it's worth to Alice.  There's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate a better price, and going to John means you'll miss out on this discount."
