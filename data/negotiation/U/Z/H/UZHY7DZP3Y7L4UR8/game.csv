"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $9,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to you. Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
