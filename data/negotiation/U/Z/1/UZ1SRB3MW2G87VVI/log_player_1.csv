"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000.  It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a high price that's significantly more than Bob's perceived value. This allows for negotiation room and establishes a strong starting point.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value and highlighting the opportunity, hoping to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by mentioning finding a price that works for both of us.

**Strategy:**

By starting high and expressing a willingness to compromise, I aim to:

* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will reveal how serious he is about buying the product.
* **Set a Strong Baseline:**  A high initial offer helps secure a better final price, even if I need to make concessions. 
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to act quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. My counteroffer for the product is $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:** While Bob's counteroffer is a significant improvement from his perceived value, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for Better Negotiations:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown interest, and we have nine rounds left to explore a mutually agreeable price.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:** The ability to sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage and allows me to hold out for a better price. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I aim to:

* **Maintain my Position:** I'm showing that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to walk away if I don't get a suitable price.
* **Encourage Bob to Increase his Offer:**  My rejection signals that he needs to offer more to secure the deal.
* **Explore Further Negotiations:** This rejection allows for further back-and-forth to find a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,700,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** I'm lowering my price from $2,000,000 to $1,700,000, showing a willingness to negotiate but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** I'm reiterating the importance of finding a deal that works for both of us, encouraging Bob to see the value in my offer.
* **Open-ended Question:** I'm leaving the ball in Bob's court, inviting him to respond and potentially continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By making a moderate counteroffer, I aim to:

* **Signal Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating that I'm open to negotiating, but not at the expense of my own financial goals.
* **Test Bob's Interest:** I want to see if he's willing to budge from his initial counteroffer and meet me halfway.
* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm still holding out for a better price while acknowledging the possibility of a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 exactly matches my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer guarantees me my desired outcome.
* **No Further Upside:**  While further negotiation could potentially lead to a higher price, there's no guarantee of success.  There's a risk that I could end up with a lower offer or even fail to reach an agreement with Bob.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of a prolonged negotiation is significant. 

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm:

* **Securing a Profit:** I'm achieving my financial goal of earning at least $1,500,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  I'm avoiding the uncertainty of further negotiations, which could potentially lead to a worse outcome.
* **Utilizing Time Efficiently:**  I'm maximizing my chances of closing the deal by accepting a favorable offer within a reasonable timeframe."
