# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product for $1,200,000. While it's worth significantly more to me, I believe this price represents a fair value for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested and we can finalize the details.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is under your maximum budget, you know you can get a better deal from John for $1,000,000.  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with John to save the extra $200,000."
