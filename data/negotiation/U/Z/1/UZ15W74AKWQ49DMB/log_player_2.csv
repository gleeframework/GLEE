"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for a lower price from John, and there's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a significant discount for you. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
While $9,500 is a better deal than Alice's first offer, it's still above your maximum budget. You can get the same product for $8,000 from John."
