"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and it's a fair price considering the value I'm getting.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a significant discount for you. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",9500.0,Alice,3,
