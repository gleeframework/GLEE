"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate and encourages him to engage, while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I can definitely get more from Bob with a counteroffer, as he's shown interest.  I'll try to meet him halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $9,500? "", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9200 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm confident that I can close the deal for a higher amount in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  $9,200 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. Would you be willing to come up to $9,400?  It's just a small step closer, and it could be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9000, and that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I'm confident that I can secure a higher price with one or two more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works. I'm going to make one last offer, and then I'll have to consider other options. How about $9,300?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value for the product."", ""product_price"": 9300}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one last offer. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8800 for the product. That's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,800 is significantly lower than my minimum, and we're running out of rounds. It's time to cut my losses and move on to a sure thing. I'll sell the product to John for $12,000.  While I'm not getting my ideal price, it's still a better outcome than settling for a significantly lower offer."
