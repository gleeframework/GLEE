Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. How about $1,600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  While $1,600,000 is a good offer, I'm confident I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal and both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering our previous discussions, how about $1,625,000? I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,625,000 is still a very good deal.  With only 6 rounds left, I'm not sure I can push for a higher price and still close the deal. It's better to take a good offer than risk getting nothing."
