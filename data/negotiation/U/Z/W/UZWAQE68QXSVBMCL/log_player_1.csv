{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a decent starting point, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me some profit. I'll assess his response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm offering $12,000. It's a compromise from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's counteroffer.  I believe it's a fair price that allows for some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit low. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for something closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $11,000.  This is a further compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this offer will be appealing enough to Bob that we can reach an agreement."
