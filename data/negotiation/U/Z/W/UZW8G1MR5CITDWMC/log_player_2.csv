"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is your maximum budget, there's no reason to accept the first offer.  We don't know Alice's minimum price, and there's a chance she might be willing to go lower. Rejecting the offer allows us to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a lower counteroffer of $10,000 is a good strategy. It signals that you're serious about getting a good deal, and it leaves room for negotiation.  We'll see if Alice is willing to come down from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $15,000 to $12,000, which is a good sign. However, there's still potential for further negotiation. By rejecting her offer, we can try to get a price closer to our desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by reducing her price.  We're now in a good position to increase our offer slightly, demonstrating that we are willing to meet halfway.  A counteroffer of $11,000 is a reasonable compromise, increasing the pressure on Alice to accept while staying within our budget."
