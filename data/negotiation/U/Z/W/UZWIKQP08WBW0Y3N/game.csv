"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is too low for me.  This product is worth a lot more. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to consider $7,000?  I believe that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see that we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $7,000 is still less than I'd like. How about $8,500? That's my final offer.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm ready to make a deal today, but I can't justify going higher than $7,500. If that works for you, I'm ready to finalize everything.",7500.0,Bob,6,
