"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $650,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $650,000 is tempting, I'm looking to secure a price closer to $700,000. This would represent a fair deal for both of us, given the product's value.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering the product to you for $675,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and our initial offer. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I understand your position, $675,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $690,000, which is a fair middle ground.  This allows us both to save some money while securing a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",690000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $690,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm counteroffering the product to you for $680,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",680000.0,Alice,5,
