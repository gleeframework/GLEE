"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which is still a good deal for you since it's worth $120 to you.  Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.",100.0,Bob,4,
