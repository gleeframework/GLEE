Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $99. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 99}
```

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed $100 from John, trying to get a higher price from Bob is worth a shot. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A price of $99 is a reasonable markup from Bob's perceived value ($80) and still significantly below your minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message doesn't sound like a final offer, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price a bit high."
