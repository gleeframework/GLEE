"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's something that's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This price gives you a slight advantage, and allows me to get a little closer to my target value. Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,1,
