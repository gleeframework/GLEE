Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
``` 
 
This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000. This means any price below that has the potential to be accepted. 
* **My Floor:** I have a minimum value of $8,000, so I want to maximize profit while staying above that floor.
* **Negotiation:** Offering $12,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might try to get it lower, but I'm still making a good profit, and it's higher than my floor. 

If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for $8,000, so there's no risk in offering a higher price to Bob."
