Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and hopefully secures a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I believe there's room for negotiation and I can likely get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate further and hopefully allows us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only slightly lower than my last counteroffer, and it's significantly higher than what John is offering. I'm willing to accept this offer to secure a sale at a good price."
