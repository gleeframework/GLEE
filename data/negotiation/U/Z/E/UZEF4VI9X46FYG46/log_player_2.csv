Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and would like to propose a more flexible deal. Considering the value you see in the product, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $750000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the product's worth. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is still a good price for you. You have a significant buffer between this offer and the price of buying from John.  There's no guarantee you'll get a better price from Alice in further negotiations, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy from her at all."
