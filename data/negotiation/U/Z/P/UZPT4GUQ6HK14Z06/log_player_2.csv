"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both Bob and Alice, there's no immediate incentive to accept Alice's offer. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I believe the product is worth every penny. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer of $1,150,000.  He's still trying to save as much money as possible, and he can likely get a lower price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,150,000. However, I'm still not quite there. I can offer you $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other options."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, which is the closest I can get to your offer without going below my minimum price. This is my final counteroffer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already saved $80,000 from his initial counteroffer.  Continuing to negotiate might result in further savings, but there's no guarantee.  It's likely that Alice will hold firm, and Bob could end up buying from John for the full $1,200,000."
