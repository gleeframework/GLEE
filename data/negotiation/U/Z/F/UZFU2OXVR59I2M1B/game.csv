"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and allows you a healthy profit margin.  Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my value for it and your desired profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This still gives you a significant profit and keeps the deal beneficial for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a compromise that allows us both to walk away with a reasonable deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I value your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm prepared to go down to $1,000,000, as this would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
