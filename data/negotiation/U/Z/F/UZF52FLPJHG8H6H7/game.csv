"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming to me.  While this product has some appeal, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but to be honest, I have a hard limit around $6,500. If we can find an agreement around there, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I may have to explore other options.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your limit, and I'm willing to get closer to it. I can offer you the product for $7,200. This is a good compromise, considering the value it holds for you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really making this tempting!  How about we split the difference and call it $7,000 even?  That's a price I can feel good about, and I'm sure you can too.",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the spirit of splitting the difference, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $7,000. I can offer you the product for $7,400. This is still a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",7400.0,Alice,7,
