"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate! Alice's starting offer is quite high. We have room to bargain before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming to me.  While this product has some appeal, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $5,000?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** Starting with a low counteroffer significantly below Alice's asking price gives us more room for negotiation.  
* **Polite and Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and appreciative tone helps keep the negotiation collaborative rather than adversarial.
* **Leaving Room for Movement:** By starting at $5,000, we signal that we're willing to move upwards, but only if Alice is willing to come down significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to our range, but we are still a fair bit above John's price. We need to signal that we're willing to walk away and take John's offer if we can't get closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but to be honest, I have a hard limit around $6,500. If we can find an agreement around there, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I may have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're getting closer to our walk-away point, so we need to be firmer with our counteroffer. Stating a ""hard limit"" adds weight to our position.
* **Introducing Alternatives:**  Mentioning that we might ""explore other options"" subtly reminds Alice about John's offer without directly using it as leverage.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Expressing that we're ready to ""close the deal today"" adds a bit of pressure and encourages a quicker resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your limit, and I'm willing to get closer to it. I can offer you the product for $7,200. This is a good compromise, considering the value it holds for you and the value I place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting very close! Alice is now below John's offer, but we still have a little room to push for a slightly better deal. We'll try one final time before likely accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really making this tempting!  How about we split the difference and call it $7,000 even?  That's a price I can feel good about, and I'm sure you can too."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer shows we're serious about closing the deal and are willing to compromise slightly to make it happen. 
* **Appealing to Fairness:** Suggesting we ""split the difference"" presents the compromise as fair and mutually beneficial. 
* **Positive Language:**  Keeping the tone light and optimistic helps maintain a good rapport, even as we approach the end of the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Alice accepts:** Great, we got a deal!
* **If Alice rejects and counteroffers:** We'll have to carefully consider her new price against John's offer of $8,000. It might be time to accept her counteroffer or move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like the spirit of splitting the difference, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $7,000. I can offer you the product for $7,400. This is still a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to budge further and is now offering a price higher than John's $8,000. While we were close to a deal with Alice, we've reached our limit, and it's more beneficial to go with John's guaranteed price at this point."
