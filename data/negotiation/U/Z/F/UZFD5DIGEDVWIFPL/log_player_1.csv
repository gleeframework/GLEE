Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter-offer, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too greedy. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
