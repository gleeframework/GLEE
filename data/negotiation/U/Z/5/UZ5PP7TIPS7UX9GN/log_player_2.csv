"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. You can potentially save more money by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.  You have a clear upper limit of $1,500,000 with John, so you have leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your desire to negotiate.  It's a fair starting point, considering your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and Alice's minimum of $1,000,000.  This gives both sides room to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is within your budget and a good price.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice might reject your next offer and you'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price without risking further delays or a worse deal."
