Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), but still leaves room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he has a strong incentive to negotiate and reach a deal. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still maintaining the potential for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than what I would get from John, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit. By rejecting his offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,300,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a significant profit for me.  It keeps the negotiation moving and hopefully leads to a mutually acceptable price."
