"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $12500? This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $12500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $13000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,5,
