"Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum value of $120.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal.  If you can't, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $125, which is still slightly above my maximum value of $120 but leaves some room for negotiation.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am also trying to get the best possible price.  If she rejects this offer, I'm prepared to move on to John, but I'd like to see if I can find a middle ground with Alice first."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is $130. This is still above my maximum value of $120.  Since I have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $120, it's no longer worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. It's time to move on to the guaranteed deal."
