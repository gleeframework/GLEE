Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really pushing for a good deal, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not willing to go below $80, as that's my minimum price.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80.

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $80, and that matches the price offered by John.  There's no point in further negotiation."
