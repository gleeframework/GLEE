"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I'd like to make you an offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for negotiation or allows you to purchase from John at a more favorable price."
