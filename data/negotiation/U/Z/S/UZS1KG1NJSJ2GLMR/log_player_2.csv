"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000, even if he's willing to pay a premium, he can't afford this.
* **There's room for negotiation.** Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's a significant margin for both parties to find a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Buying from John is too expensive.** John's price is Bob's absolute maximum, and there's no reason to pay that much right away when there's a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to Bob's desired price, $875,000 is still above the $800,000 value to Alice, suggesting there's more room for negotiation.
* **Buying from John is too expensive.** As before, John's price is the absolute maximum, and Bob should try to get a lower price from Alice.
* **There's a clear pattern.** Alice is willing to negotiate, and Bob should continue to counter-offer to try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay right now. Considering the product's value to you at $800,000, I'm willing to offer $860,000.  This price represents a good deal for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $900,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you a price of $890,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's desired price.** While still slightly above Bob's ideal, $890,000 is within a reasonable range considering the product's value to Alice. 
* **The negotiation is progressing.** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly lower price.
* **Time is running out.** With only five rounds remaining, accepting Alice's offer secures the product without the risk of running out of time and having to buy from John at a significantly higher price."
