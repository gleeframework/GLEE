"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay right now. Considering the product's value to you at $800,000, I'm willing to offer $860,000.  This price represents a good deal for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can close this deal quickly.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $900,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you a price of $890,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",890000.0,Alice,5,
