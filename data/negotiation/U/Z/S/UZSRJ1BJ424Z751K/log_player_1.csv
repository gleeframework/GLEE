Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting offer that is higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a good middle ground to start, and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}

I'm going to counter with $1,125,000.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer.  I hope it's enough to get him to agree, but still gives me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

Bob's offer is now at my desired price point.  This is a good deal for me, so I'll accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
