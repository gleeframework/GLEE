"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I value your perspective, $1200000 is a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1350000? This price still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
