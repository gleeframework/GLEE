"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer.**  Buying from Alice saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You still get the product for a price below your maximum.** Even at $9,000, you're still getting the product for less than your $10,000 limit."
