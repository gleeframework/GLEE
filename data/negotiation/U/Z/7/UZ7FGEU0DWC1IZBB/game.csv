"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. This would still give you a healthy profit, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This still allows you a significant profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering your profit margin and my budget.  Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
