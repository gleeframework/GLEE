"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price that still gives me a good profit, and I think it's a great deal for you as well.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, which is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price that still gives me a good profit, and I think it's a great deal for you as well.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a little out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair compromise. I'm really hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still talking. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $9,200. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",9200.0,Alice,7,
