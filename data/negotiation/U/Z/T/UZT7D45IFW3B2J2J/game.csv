"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10500? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10500 is a bit closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $10800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10200? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",10200.0,Bob,6,
