"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000 to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1,125,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can do $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. However, I'm willing to give you a slight discount to $1,175,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
