"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find the product at a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $95?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept $95. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original budget. Could you possibly lower the price to $98? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us.",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $98 and $105, so how about we try $101? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",101.0,Alice,5,
