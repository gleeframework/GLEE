Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone by framing it as a ""great deal""."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will try to counter his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
