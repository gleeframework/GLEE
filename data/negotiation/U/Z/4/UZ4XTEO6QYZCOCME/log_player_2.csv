"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum price ($120).  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price.  Buying from John is always an option if the negotiation fails, but it's best to try and get a better price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $100. This is below my maximum price but still leaves room for negotiation. Alice values the product at $150, so there is a potential for agreement.  This aggressive counteroffer will hopefully encourage Alice to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $160 is closer to my maximum, it's still above my desired price.  I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating. There's a good chance Alice will come down further, and I'm still willing to pay more than John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $115. This is still below my maximum price and reflects a willingness to compromise. It's also close to the midpoint between Alice's offer of $160 and my desired price of $120. This should encourage Alice to accept the offer or come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $155 is just above my maximum price, but it's getting close. I'm willing to accept this offer because:

* **It's only slightly over my budget:** I can afford to pay $155 and still save a bit compared to buying from John.
* **The negotiation may not get better:** Alice has already come down considerably, and it's uncertain if she'll be willing to negotiate further. It's better to accept a slightly higher price than risk getting stuck with John's price.

While I prefer to pay $120, the possibility of losing the product and having to buy from John makes accepting the offer the most sensible option at this point."
