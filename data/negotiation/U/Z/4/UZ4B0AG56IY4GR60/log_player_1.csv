"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the potential value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,050,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end and is the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to my acceptable range, it's unlikely he'll reach a price point that outweighs the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  Continuing negotiations at this point presents more risk than reward."
