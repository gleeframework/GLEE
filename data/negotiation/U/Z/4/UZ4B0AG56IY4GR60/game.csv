"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the potential value of the product to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,050,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end and is the best I can do.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
