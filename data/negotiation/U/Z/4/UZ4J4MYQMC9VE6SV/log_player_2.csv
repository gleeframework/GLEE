"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It's highly likely you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, which signals that you're serious about getting a good deal. However, it's still within a potentially acceptable range for Alice, considering her product's value to her is $12,000.
* **Opens room for negotiation:** By starting lower, we create space for back-and-forth negotiation.  Alice is likely to counter, giving us more information about her acceptable price range. 
* **Alternative option:**  We always have the option of going to John if Alice's counteroffers remain unreasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're working with a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above our ideal price and what John offers. There's room for further negotiation. We're getting closer to the end of the rounds, but we'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $9,500? I'm eager to make a deal and that feels like a fair price."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  We're showing willingness to compromise by moving up from our previous offer. 
* **Targeting a sweet spot:** This offer is slightly above the midpoint between Alice's last offer and our previous counteroffer. 
* **Sense of urgency:** By expressing eagerness to close the deal, we signal that we're serious and time might be a factor (even though we haven't revealed our alternative option)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $12,000. How about $10,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's unlikely to go much lower than her current offer of $10,750. While we might be able to negotiate her down a little more, it's not worth the risk of exceeding our $10,000 budget.  John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000. It makes the most financial sense to take the sure thing at this point."
