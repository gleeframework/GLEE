"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $9000 for it. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the value it can bring to your business.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $10500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $10200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $9800 for the product. Can you consider that price?",9800.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $10100. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",10100.0,Alice,7,
