"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both recognize in this product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Given our previous discussion, I'm willing to go up to $850,000,  which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
