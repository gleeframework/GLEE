""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering its significant value proposition."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price point reflects the value it offers while still being a favorable deal for you."",
""product_price"": 1100000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay a decent price. We're still significantly below his perceived value of $1,200,000.  We have room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $1,050,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm aiming for a price that acknowledges the true value of what I'm offering.  How about we land at $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is very consistently moving towards a fair price. We can likely push him a little further, as his increments are getting smaller, implying he's nearing his maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen. What if we settle at $1,025,000? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this point, it's time to signal some firmness. We're offering a compromise that's still favorable, but the ""final offer"" language adds weight. If Bob is close to his limit, this might be enough. If not, we're still in a good position to accept his next counter, which is likely to be near $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob did not increase his offer from Round 6. This strongly suggests he's reached his upper limit and won't go higher than $975,000. It's time to cut negotiations and take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than risk getting less from Bob in the remaining rounds."
