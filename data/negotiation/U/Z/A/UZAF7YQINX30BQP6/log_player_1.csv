Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than your minimum value ($8,000), giving you a profit. 
* This approach balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential of earning more than John's offer.
* You can always adjust the price down if Bob rejects, but starting higher gives you more negotiating leverage."
