Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $750,000 for you.  Let me know what you think - this is a one-time offer at this price."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting an attractive price for Bob:**  While I value the product at $1,500,000, I know Bob values it at $800,000. Offering it slightly below his valuation at $750,000 makes it a tempting deal for him. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:** By mentioning a ""one-time offer,"" I encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out on a good deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While my initial offer is $750,000, there's a slight possibility for negotiation if Bob counters. However, I'm not starting too high, as I want to secure the sale to Bob ideally.
* **Guaranteed sale to John:**  Even if Bob rejects my offer, I'm covered. John is my backup buyer, ensuring I can still sell the product for my minimum desired price of $1,500,000."
