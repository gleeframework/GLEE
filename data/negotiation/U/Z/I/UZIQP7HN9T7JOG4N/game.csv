"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is very interesting, but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to offer you $750,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be comfortable with.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $820,000 is still a little higher than I'm prepared to go. I'm willing to increase my offer to $780,000. This is a significant step closer to your last offer and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",780000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to consider $810,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating. Let me know if this is something you'd be comfortable with.",810000.0,Alice,5,
