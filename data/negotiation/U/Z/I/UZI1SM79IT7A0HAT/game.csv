"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still outside of my budget. I'm ready to close the deal at $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product, and I believe it's a fair price given our current positions. Let's try to come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
