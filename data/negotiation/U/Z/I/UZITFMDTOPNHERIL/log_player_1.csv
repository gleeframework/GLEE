Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. I'm asking for $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, we don't want to limit ourselves. Starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value is potentially even higher for Bob, justifying the high price. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone is positive and encourages a dialogue. If Bob rejects this initial offer, there's still a chance to negotiate downwards before going to John.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening move. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's reaction and any counter-offers he might make."
