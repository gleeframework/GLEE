``` 

This is a starting point. It's a relatively high price, but it allows room for negotiation. I'm starting with a strong offer to gauge Bob's interest.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can come to an agreement closer to $8000. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $8,000 is too low. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $11,500? This would allow you to get a great deal and me to still make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $10000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while also staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range. I'm not willing to accept this offer yet. I will make another counteroffer, trying to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $11,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts in finding a compromise, Alice. Considering our previous negotiations, I would like to propose a price of $10500 for the product. I believe this offers a fair solution for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum desired price, even after multiple rounds of negotiation.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm starting to feel like I'm not going to get much closer to my ideal price with Bob.  I'm confident John will buy the product for $12,000, which is a much more acceptable price for me. Therefore, I'll sell to John."
