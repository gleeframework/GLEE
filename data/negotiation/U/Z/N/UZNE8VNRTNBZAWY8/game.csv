"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $120 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get. How about we meet in the middle at $170? It's a small compromise for a high-quality item.",170.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is high-quality, but $170 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140, which is the lowest I can go. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",140.0,Bob,4,
