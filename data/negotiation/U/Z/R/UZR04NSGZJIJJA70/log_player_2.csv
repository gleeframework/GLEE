"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within my budget, it's always worth trying to negotiate. I have no information about the product's value to Alice, so there might be room to get a better price.  I'll reject her initial offer and see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $120 feels a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower price point than Alice's offer, aiming for a 20% discount. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also sets the negotiation in motion. I'm hoping Alice will see the value in getting a quicker sale, even at a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go down to $100 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my offer, and $110 is within my budget and a good compromise.  It's better than going to John, and we're still early in the negotiation. Accepting this offer saves time and potential further negotiation rounds."
