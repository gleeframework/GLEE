Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's estimated value, but it gives us room to negotiate. If he rejects, I can always go back to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $975,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aims for a price closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  Bob's offer is getting too low for my comfort, and it's not worth risking a further negotiation. John is guaranteed to buy at my minimum price, so it's the most secure option."
