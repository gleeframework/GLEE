"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $10500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my initial counteroffer. Can we try $10250? I think that's a fair compromise.",10250.0,Bob,4,
