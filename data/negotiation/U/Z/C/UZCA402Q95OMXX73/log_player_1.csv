"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. My asking price is $10,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's below my minimum acceptable price but gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth exchange and potentially leads to a mutually acceptable price within the 10 rounds.
* **Focus on value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob may make him more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's tempting to accept, I'm aiming for a higher price.
* **There are still rounds left to negotiate.** I can counteroffer and try to reach a mutually acceptable price within the remaining time.
* **Selling to John is a safe option, but not optimal at this point.** While $12,000 is guaranteed, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer.  However, $8,500 is significantly below what I need to sell it for. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a price that I can realistically consider. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable decrease:** My initial offer was $10,000, so lowering it to $9,500 shows flexibility while still maintaining a decent profit margin. 
* **Highlight the remaining negotiation room:** This encourages Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain a positive and cooperative tone:** This fosters a better relationship with Bob and may increase the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm aiming for a higher amount. 
* **There are still rounds left to negotiate.** I have time to counteroffer and try to get closer to my target price.
* **Selling to John is a safe option, but not optimal yet.** I'm still hoping to get a better price through negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm trying to be flexible here.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to close this deal in this round!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($9,000) and my previous offer ($9,500). This shows my willingness to compromise and reach a deal.
* **Focus on value:**  Again, reminding Bob of the product's value may make him more inclined to accept my offer.
* **Urgency:**  Adding a sense of urgency by suggesting a deal in this round might encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're approaching the middle of the negotiation rounds, and there's a significant gap between my desired price and Bob's offers.
* **Risk of further concessions:**  If I continue to counteroffer, I risk lowering my price further, potentially ending up with an amount significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John offers a guaranteed deal:**  Selling to John for $12,000 ensures a good profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who might not be willing to meet my price expectations. 

It's time to secure the guaranteed profit and sell to John."
