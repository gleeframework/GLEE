"I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer.  However, $8,500 is significantly below what I need to sell it for. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a price that I can realistically consider. Let's see if we can make this work.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm trying to be flexible here.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to close this deal in this round!",9250.0,Alice,5,
