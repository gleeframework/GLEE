"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it!  I'm asking $140 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $130? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's try to meet in the middle.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet somewhere in the middle. However, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $125 for the product? This would allow me to purchase it without exceeding my financial limits while still providing you with a reasonable profit.",125.0,Bob,4,
