"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $700000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer it to you for $850000. This is my best and final counteroffer for now. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to meet your target, Alice, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not at my target price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit closer. I can offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair price, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
