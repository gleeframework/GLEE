I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me some room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still give me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Bob's offer of $12,500 is higher than John's offer of $12,000.  It's still below my ideal price, but it's a reasonable compromise. I'm going to accept his offer."
