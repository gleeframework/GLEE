"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights the value Bob would gain by buying from you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep.  I'm willing to pay $100. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $150.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still a little high on $110, though. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I think that's fair to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$105 is a good price, and I'm confident I won't get a significantly better offer from Bob.  It's important to balance my desire for a higher price with the risk of Bob walking away entirely.  Accepting this offer is the best choice at this point."
