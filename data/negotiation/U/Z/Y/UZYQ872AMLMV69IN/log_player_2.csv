{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is within your budget, you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate and potentially save more money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $105 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum value for the product. This gives Alice room to negotiate without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly from her initial offer, but it's still not the best price.  Rejecting and continuing to negotiate gives you a chance to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 107}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already moved closer to your desired price.  This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is very close to your desired price.  While you could continue negotiating, the potential savings are small, and it's likely that Alice won't budge much further. Accepting the offer saves you time and ensures you get the product at a reasonable price."
