"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this valuable product with you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth in the market."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer. This leaves room for concessions and creates the impression that the product is highly valuable.
* **Not Too High:** While starting high, we don't want to completely alienate Bob with an unreasonable price.  This initial offer is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justify the Price:** By highlighting ""unique features"" and ""market worth"", we provide some justification for the high price, even if these aspects are not explicitly stated. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility while keeping the option to negotiate down towards a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price is way beyond my budget. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. It's clear we need to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about we consider $1,800,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease:** We're making a substantial drop from our initial offer to show Bob we're willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Above Minimum:**  We remain well above our minimum acceptable price to allow for further negotiation without risking a loss. 
* **Encouraging Compromise:** By phrasing it as finding ""middle ground,"" we encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate you moving towards a compromise, the gap between our valuations is still significant. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is increasing, $700,000 is still significantly less than our $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob is clearly engaged in the negotiation and willing to increase his offer, indicating potential for a better deal.
* **Time Remaining:**  We have enough rounds left to continue negotiating and try to close the gap.

We'll reject this offer but remain optimistic about finding a mutually agreeable price in the subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. Let's bridge this gap. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to reach a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We are making a significant jump down to $1,450,000. This is close to our minimum but leaves a small margin for potential further negotiation.
* **Signaling Strong Interest:**  This offer signals to Bob that we are serious about closing a deal with him and willing to make concessions to do so.
* **Justification and Urgency:**  We are emphasizing the size of the reduction and framing it as a gesture to encourage Bob to make a similar move towards a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. However, the price is still too high for me.  I can offer $800,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the very top of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has stated that $800,000 is his final offer. 
* **Below Minimum:** This is still significantly below our $1,500,000 minimum acceptable price. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.

Continuing the negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a price that meets our needs. Selling to John ensures we receive our minimum acceptable price without further risk or delay."
