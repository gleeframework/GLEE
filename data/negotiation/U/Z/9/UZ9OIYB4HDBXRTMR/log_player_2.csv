"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $13,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, aiming to move the negotiation closer to a price favorable for me. It leaves room for further negotiation while still being a reasonable price point for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I am unable to accept it at $11,000. However, I would like to propose a revised price of $12,000 for the product. I hope this is within your budget and meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is negotiating but not drastically dropping her price.  $12,000 is a decent compromise, saving $3,000 from John's price and likely close to the best deal achievable with Alice."
