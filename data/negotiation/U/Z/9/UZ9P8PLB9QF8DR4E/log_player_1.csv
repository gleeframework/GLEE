This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for potential compromise.  It also frames the offer as fair, which may make Bob more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive."
