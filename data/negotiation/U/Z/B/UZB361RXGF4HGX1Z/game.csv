"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $160. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",160.0,Alice,1,

"Hey Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $160 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $140?  That's still a good price for you, and it fits my budget.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $152? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",152.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $152 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now. How about $145? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $145 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good price for my product. How about we meet at $148? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but it's a fair price for me.",148.0,Alice,5,
