"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by its creators. Considering its quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than what you've assessed. However, I understand value perceptions vary. To make this deal attractive for both of us, I propose a price of $140. This allows you to acquire a high-quality item at a slightly above-market rate, while ensuring I receive a fair compensation for my efforts in bringing this opportunity to you. Let me know if this proposal suits your budget and preferences. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your $120 maximum. You know John will sell you the same product for $120. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move to John and secure the product at your target price."
