"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $14,000 for the product. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle somewhere around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $13,000 for the product. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",13000.0,Alice,5,
