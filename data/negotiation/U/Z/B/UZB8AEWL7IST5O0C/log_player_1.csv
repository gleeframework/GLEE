{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for negotiation while also demonstrating my willingness to compromise. I'm confident that I can secure a good price while leaving the door open for a counteroffer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a good deal for Bob, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly below my value. I will counteroffer to try and find a price that's more favorable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a fair price, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still aiming to keep my expenses within $10,000. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between, perhaps at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my minimum price of $15,000, $11,000 is a significant improvement over Bob's initial offer of $10,000. This price is also closer to my counteroffer of $11,500. It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident I can find other buyers if I need to in the future."
