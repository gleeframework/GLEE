"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a significantly high offer ($2,300,000) to establish a strong starting point and allow room for negotiation. This tactic aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language (""fantastic opportunity,"" ""true worth"") to convey the product's value and my confidence in the deal.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Considering the value you mentioned, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This represents a fair compromise and allows for potential profit for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). I have room to negotiate and am willing to see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  I'm not ready to accept his offer or sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you've suggested doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is a significant reduction and represents my strong desire to see this deal through with you."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial decrease from my initial offer ($300,000 reduction) to signal my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Ground:**  However, I'm still holding firm above my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm continuing to reinforce the product's value to justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still above my budget.  I understand the product has value, but I'm limited to $1,400,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that the negotiations could drag on. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the potential risk of losing the deal altogether."
