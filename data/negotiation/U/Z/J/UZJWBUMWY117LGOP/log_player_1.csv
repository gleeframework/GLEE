Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message and positions the product as valuable to Bob. Offering $100 is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to do? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is tempting, I'm hoping to get closer to $95 for this product.  It's really a great deal for you, and it's still lower than what it's worth. Let's split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with. How about $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$92 is a good compromise and is above my minimum desired price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
