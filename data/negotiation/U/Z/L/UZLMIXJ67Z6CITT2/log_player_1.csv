I'm offering the product to Bob for $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, giving me a potential profit of $5,000. 

However, it's important to remember that Bob's valuation of the product is unknown. If he values it at $20,000 or higher, he will likely accept the offer. If he values it lower, he will reject, but I'm still guaranteed a sale to John for $15,000. This strategy balances the potential for higher profit with the security of a guaranteed sale."
