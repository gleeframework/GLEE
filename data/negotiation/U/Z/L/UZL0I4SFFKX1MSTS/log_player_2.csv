"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a great price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $150.  You can get the product for a better price from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
