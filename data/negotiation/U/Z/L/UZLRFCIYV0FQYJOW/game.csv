"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price for the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?  Let me know if that works for you.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try $7,750. This is a good compromise for both of us, and it allows me to stay above my minimum while also getting you a good deal.",7750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. To be honest, I'm getting close to my limit. I could do $7,400, but that's the best I can offer. ",7400.0,Bob,6,
