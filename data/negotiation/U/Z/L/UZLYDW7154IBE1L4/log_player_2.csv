While Alice's offer is better than her first, it's still above Bob's target price of $15,000. It's worth seeing if they can negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $16000 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $16250. This is as low as I can go, so please let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
