Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price.  This is a bold move, but I'm hoping it'll get Bob to come close to my value quickly. If he rejects, I'll have to be more flexible, but I'm confident I can get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is too far below my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my value, but I'm still willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000.  This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates I'm willing to be flexible while also ensuring I don't undervalue my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is still below my minimum, it's a good deal considering Bob's initial offer and the fact that I could always sell to John for $12,000.  I'm not going to risk losing this deal by being too stubborn."
