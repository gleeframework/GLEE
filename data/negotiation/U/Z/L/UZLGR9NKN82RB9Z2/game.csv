"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in your product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your position.  $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $1300000? I believe this is a fair price considering our previous discussions.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
