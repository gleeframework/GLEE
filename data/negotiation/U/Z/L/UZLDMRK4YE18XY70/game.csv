"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $13,000, which is a fair compromise. If you're not willing to go that low, I'm going to have to consider my other options.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already come down from $18,000 to $15,000, and now you're asking me to go down to $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,000 and $13,000, which is $14,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
