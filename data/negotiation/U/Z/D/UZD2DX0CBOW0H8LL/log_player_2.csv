**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my limit, even though it's closer. I'll try to counteroffer again and see if I can get a price closer to my target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiation, as John is already offering a price I'm comfortable with."
