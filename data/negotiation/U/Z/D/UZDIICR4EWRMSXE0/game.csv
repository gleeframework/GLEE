"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $110.  That way we can both get a good deal.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50, but that's as low as I can go.",112.5,Alice,5,
