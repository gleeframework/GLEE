"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for you, as you know its value to you is $800,000. Let's see if we can make this happen!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $675,000? It's a significant step from my previous offer and keeps us both moving towards a deal.",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $675,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $712,500. This offer is very close to your last one and would allow us both to walk away happy. Let's close this deal!",712500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $690,000. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",690000.0,Bob,6,
