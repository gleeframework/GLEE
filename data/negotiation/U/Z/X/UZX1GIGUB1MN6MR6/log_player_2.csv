Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $800,000 doesn't reflect that. I could consider letting it go for $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.
