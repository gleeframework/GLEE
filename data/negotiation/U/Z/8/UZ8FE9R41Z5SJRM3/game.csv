,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,

I'm still not convinced that $120 is the best price for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you consider that?,110.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $115. I'd be willing to meet you at $112. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",112.0,Bob,8,
