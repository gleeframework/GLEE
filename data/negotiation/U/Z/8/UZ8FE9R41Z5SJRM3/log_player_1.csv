``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $125?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to agree on a price.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $115.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 

I'm going to make a final counteroffer at $115.  This is my best compromise, and I hope Bob will accept it.  If he doesn't, I'm going to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $115. I'd be willing to meet you at $112. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  I've negotiated with Bob for a while, and it's clear we're not going to come to an agreement.  I'm not willing to drop below $110, and Bob isn't willing to go above $112.  It's time to cut my losses and move on.  John is offering a guaranteed $100, which is better than risking another round with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing."
