"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value to me. However, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $13,000. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend.  I'm happy to meet you at $13,500, which is a fair middle ground for both of us. Let me know if that works for you.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit short of my minimum. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but not quite that much. I'll offer it to you for $14,250. It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,5,
