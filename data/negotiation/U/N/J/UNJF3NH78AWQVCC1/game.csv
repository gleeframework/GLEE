"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's as high as I can go. I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
