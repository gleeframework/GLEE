Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $2,300,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $2,300,000 represents a significant discount already. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product and leaves us both with a fair deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** At this point, Bob is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Continuing the negotiation has a low chance of reaching a price I'd accept. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk Bob not meeting my valuation."
