"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that is fair to both of us. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable product at a price that is significantly lower than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
