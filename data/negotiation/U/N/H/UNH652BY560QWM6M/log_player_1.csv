Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefit you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still settle on a price higher than John's offer.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, justifying the high price. 

By aiming high, we increase the likelihood of securing a deal that significantly surpasses our backup offer from John."
