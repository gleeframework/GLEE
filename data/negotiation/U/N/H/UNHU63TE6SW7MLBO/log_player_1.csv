Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Offering the product at $11,500 creates a significant potential profit for Alice ($1,500 more than Bob values it for) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($500 less than he values it at). 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning other potential buyers, Alice creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
