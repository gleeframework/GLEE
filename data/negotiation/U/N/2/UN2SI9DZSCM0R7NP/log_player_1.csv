"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  After careful consideration of its value, I'd like to start the negotiation at $1,600,000."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always beneficial to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if the price is significantly higher than his valuation, it sets a reference point for future offers. 
* **Signaling:** Offering a high initial price signals that you believe the product is highly valuable. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving room for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to  $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than both your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. Accepting his offer now would leave a substantial amount of potential profit on the table. 

While selling to John is a guaranteed $1,200,000, it's still worthwhile to see if you can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** Showing willingness to negotiate by lowering your price demonstrates flexibility and encourages Bob to do the same.
* **Gradual Decrease:**  The large gap between your initial offer and Bob's offer necessitates a more substantial decrease on your end. However, the decrease is still gradual to avoid signaling desperation.
* **Target Zone:**  This counteroffer aims to establish a negotiation range closer to your desired outcome while acknowledging Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see the value, but I have a budget to work with.  How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress! Bob is increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price and significantly less than John's offer. Let's keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to the product's value. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider $1,250,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** By suggesting a price halfway between your last offer ($1,400,000) and his last offer ($950,000), you're demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still anchoring the price above your minimum. 
* **Emphasize Compromise:**  Highlighting that this offer is a significant move on your part reinforces the value of the product and encourages Bob to make a similarly substantial move.
* **Urgency:** With fewer rounds remaining, creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to reach an agreement sooner."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  That said, I can't go any higher than $1,000,000. That's my firm limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has now explicitly stated his maximum budget,  $1,000,000.  It's unlikely he'll go any higher. 
* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** While you could continue negotiating, the potential gains above $1,000,000 are likely to be small. Continuing the negotiation increases the risk of Bob walking away altogether.
* **Time Value:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000. Accepting Bob's offer allows you to close the deal now and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation.

While accepting Bob's offer means leaving $200,000 on the table compared to John's offer, it represents a reasonable compromise considering the time and effort already invested in the negotiation."
