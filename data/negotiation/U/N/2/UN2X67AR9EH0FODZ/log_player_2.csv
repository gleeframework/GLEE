"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is under your $10,000 limit, you can do better. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her product's value of $8,000. You always have the safety net of buying from John for $10,000."
