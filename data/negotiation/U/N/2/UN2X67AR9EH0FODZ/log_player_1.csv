{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Secure a Deal:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value increases the likelihood of acceptance. 

By offering the product at $9,500, Alice aims to secure a deal that significantly exceeds her minimum acceptable price of $8,000."
