Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have John as a backup at $80 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum."
