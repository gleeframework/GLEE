Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering a high price initially allows for room to negotiate.
* **Strong Opening:**  The message expresses confidence in the product's value and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Plan B:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 sets a floor for my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its true worth. How about we set the product price at $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer matches my floor price.  There's no incentive to negotiate further as I'm already guaranteed the minimum I'm willing to accept.
* **No Room for Profit:** While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk Bob will walk away and I'll be left with no buyer. 
* **Secure Deal:** Selling to John ensures I get my desired price and avoids any potential delays or complications of further negotiation."
