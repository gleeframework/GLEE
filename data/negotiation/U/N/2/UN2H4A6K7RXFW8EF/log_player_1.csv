Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This gives Bob a good deal while still leaving some room for negotiation for me.  I'm confident he'll be willing to pay at least this much, considering the product is worth $150 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm countering with $130. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's lower offer but still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $125 is still significantly better than selling to John for $100. It's likely that further negotiation won't lead to a significantly better deal, and I'm happy to finalize the sale."
