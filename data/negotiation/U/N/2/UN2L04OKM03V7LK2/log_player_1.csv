Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Based on my research and understanding of the market, I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential benefits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,800,000 is a respectable offer, the value this product brings to the table is truly unique.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations in terms of ROI. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $2,100,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I still need to stay within my budget. Considering your previous offers, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to move forward with the deal if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $2,000,000 is a significant profit. It's unlikely I can get closer to $2,300,000 without risking the deal entirely."
