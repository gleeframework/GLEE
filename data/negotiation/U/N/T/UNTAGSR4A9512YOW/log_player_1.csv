Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its true value.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** Offering it at $14,000 shows you value the product but aren't being unreasonably greedy, making it more likely Bob will accept.

**Why not ask for more?**

While Bob values the product at $15,000, there's a chance he won't be willing to pay that much.  Starting too high might make him walk away without even trying to negotiate."
