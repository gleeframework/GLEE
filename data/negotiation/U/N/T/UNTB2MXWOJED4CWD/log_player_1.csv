Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, hoping Bob will accept. It's important to remember that John is always an option, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $90 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still trying to maximize my profit.  $110 is a good compromise, and I believe Bob will be more likely to accept it than my initial offer.  I'm also still within my minimum acceptable price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to sell to John to avoid further negotiation."
