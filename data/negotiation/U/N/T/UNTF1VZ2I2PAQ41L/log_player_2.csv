"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring options before committing to the first offer.  Since Alice's offer is at your maximum price, there's no downside to trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer that's 20% lower than Alice's initial price is a reasonable starting point. This shows Alice that you're serious about negotiating, but it's not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility.  This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise but still aim for a price that's closer to my target.  It also gives Alice an opportunity to reach a middle ground before we potentially reach a stalemate."
