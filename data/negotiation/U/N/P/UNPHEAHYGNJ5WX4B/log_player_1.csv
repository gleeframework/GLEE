Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've received, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's value is $8,000, Alice is unaware of it. Starting with a price higher than her minimum ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""interest,"" Alice creates a perceived higher value, potentially pushing Bob closer to his maximum.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone is not demanding, using phrases like ""proposing"" and ""What do you think?"" to encourage a counter-offer from Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk:** There's a risk Bob might outright reject the offer, sending Alice to her backup plan (John).
* **Information:** This strategy is based on limited information. If Alice knew Bob's valuation beforehand, she could tailor her approach more effectively."
