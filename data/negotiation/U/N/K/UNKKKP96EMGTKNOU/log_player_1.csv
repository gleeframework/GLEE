"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.

Bob's offer is too low.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a great product, and I think you'll find it worth the investment.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks again for the offer, but $140 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $120. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still not willing to sell for that low of a price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  I can come down to $130. This is my final offer, let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really close to my budget, and I can offer $125. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can close the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  It's not worth risking a continued negotiation with Bob when I can sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
