"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I believe it could significantly contribute to your endeavors or personal goals. I am offering you the chance to own this item at a special price of $950,000. This is a generous offer considering its true worth, and I am confident it represents a fantastic investment for you. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly inflating the value of the product to you. You know it's worth no more than $1,000,000, and she claims it's worth that much while simultaneously offering a ""discount.""
* You have a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,000,000.  
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high.  There's a chance she'll come back with a lower offer closer to her actual valuation of $800,000."
