"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable price for this valuable asset.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, I have the option to buy from another seller for $1,200,000. I'm trying to make this work with you, though.  Would you be willing to come down to $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I've already compromised by meeting you halfway earlier, and I'm not willing to give up more value. I'll offer you a new compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
