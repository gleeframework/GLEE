Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me, though. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. I can do $1,300,000.  This is a fair offer considering John is offering me the same product for $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly aware of John's offer and is using it as leverage. While Bob's offer is increasing, it's unlikely he'll reach a price significantly higher than $1,500,000 in the remaining rounds.  It makes the most financial sense to take John's guaranteed offer and avoid the risk of Bob's lowballing tactics."
