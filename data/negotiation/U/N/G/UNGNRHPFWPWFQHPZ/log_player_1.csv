{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This is a starting point that is above Bob's valuation but below my minimum. It allows for potential negotiation while still leaving room for profit.
* **""Message"":** A friendly, inviting message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Open negotiation:**  A lower starting point encourages Bob to counter, potentially leading to a higher final price.
* **Secure a good deal:**  $14,000 is a good starting point that allows for potential profit, while still being attractive to Bob. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  It provides flexibility to adjust the price based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Continuing negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a price that is more favorable to me, potentially securing a higher price closer to my desired $15,000.
* **Leaving the door open to John:**  If negotiation with Bob fails, I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which guarantees my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit, and it's a significant discount from my original offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering a price of $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **""Message"":**  The message emphasizes understanding Bob's budget while highlighting the potential for a fair deal for both parties. 
* **Staying above minimum:**  $13,500 is still above my minimum price of $15,000, ensuring I don't make a loss.
* **Encouraging agreement:**  The message is positive and suggests a willingness to find a compromise, which might persuade Bob to accept the offer.

This strategy aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrating a willingness to compromise signals a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Push for a higher price:** The counteroffer is closer to my desired price than Bob's offer.
* **Maintain negotiation control:** It allows me to continue the negotiation while keeping the option to sell to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $13,000. This would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer:** While $13,000 is still slightly below my desired price, it's a good deal considering the ongoing negotiation. It's also closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but it would also require additional time and effort. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and eliminates the risk of Bob rejecting future counteroffers.
* **Guaranteeing profit:** $13,000 is a significant profit compared to my minimum, ensuring a successful transaction. 

This decision balances the desire for a higher price with the practical considerations of time, effort, and minimizing risk. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable sale while minimizing the potential for further negotiation."
