Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts high, knowing Bob has a lower valuation.  The goal is to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $850,000. This is my best offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's still potential for a more favorable outcome.  Rejecting this offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $1,000,000 is still my minimum. This product is worth a lot, and I'm confident it will be a valuable investment for you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'll receive from the product. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's still a chance we can find a mutually agreeable price. It's worth exploring if we can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $900,000. However, I'm still at a point where I need to make at least $950,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  This product offers a significant value, and I'm confident you'll see great returns on your investment. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can go up to $925,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us to a point where we can close this deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is tempting, it's still below my desired minimum of $1,000,000. I've already conceded some ground, but I'm not willing to drop below my target yet. I have more rounds left, and I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer, especially considering the value he places on the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this deal work, I need to reach a price of $975,000. This product has significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects that. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and come to a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}
