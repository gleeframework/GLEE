"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $850,000. This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $1,000,000 is still my minimum. This product is worth a lot, and I'm confident it will be a valuable investment for you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'll receive from the product. Let's find a way to make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $900,000. However, I'm still at a point where I need to make at least $950,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  This product offers a significant value, and I'm confident you'll see great returns on your investment. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can go up to $925,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us to a point where we can close this deal.  What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this deal work, I need to reach a price of $975,000. This product has significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects that. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and come to a final agreement.",975000.0,Alice,7,
