"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $650,000. Would that be possible?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $675,000. This is my final concession. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
