"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has many great features, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $6,000. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $7,000? I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $8,200. This is a reasonable price that still reflects the value I believe the product holds. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
