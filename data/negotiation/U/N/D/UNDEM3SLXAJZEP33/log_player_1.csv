"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired selling price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,800,000, we're setting a high anchor point. Even if Bob doesn't agree to this price, it sets a frame of reference for subsequent counteroffers.
* **Confidence:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize our potential profit while also leaving space to negotiate and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is significantly higher than my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both your minimum price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($800,000). This suggests there is room for negotiation. While selling to John is always an option, it's too early to settle for your minimum price.  We'll aim to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your initial offer, the product's value is considerably higher than that. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant price adjustment and reflects my desire to reach a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from $1,800,000 to $1,400,000 to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. 
* **Above Minimum:** We're still significantly above our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), providing room for further negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message emphasizes a desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the price adjustment, we subtly reinforce the product's value.

This strategy aims to keep Bob engaged while pushing the price closer to a more favorable outcome for us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the adjustment. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations.  I could consider $700,000. This demonstrates my willingness to move closer to your asking price while staying within a reasonable budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still substantially below our minimum of $1,200,000 and even further from his perceived value of $800,000. We have room to negotiate and try to bring him closer to our target price. 

It's still too early to settle for a price that's significantly lower than our minimum, especially when we have a guaranteed offer from John. Let's continue negotiating with Bob for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your current offer is still significantly below the product's true market value. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider $1,100,000. This is a substantial compromise on my end and reflects my strong desire to close this deal."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're acknowledging Bob's effort while firmly reiterating that his offer is undervaluing the product.
* **Strategic Compromise:** By moving to $1,100,000, we're making another significant concession but staying above our absolute minimum. 
* **Deadline Pressure:**  Subtly introducing a sense of urgency by emphasizing our desire to close the deal might encourage Bob to be more decisive.

This approach balances firmness on price with a willingness to negotiate, aiming to guide Bob closer to a mutually agreeable figure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. To be frank, anything above $800,000 is pushing my absolute limit.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 as a final attempt to reach an agreement.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. Here's why:

* **Bob's Limit:**  Bob has clearly stated that $800,000 is his absolute limit. This aligns with his perceived value of the product, leaving very little room for negotiation.
* **Unrealistic Expectations:**  Even with our concessions, we're still significantly apart. It's unlikely we can bridge the gap and reach a price that meets both our needs. 
* **Guaranteed Offer:** We have a solid offer from John for $1,200,000, which guarantees us our minimum acceptable price. 

Continuing the negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer and would mean risking the guaranteed sale to John."
