Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's still lower than my minimum desired price of $150.  This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:** This sets the initial negotiation point in my favor. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** There's space for Bob to counteroffer if he's not comfortable with the price.
* **Encourage a deal:** It's not so high that Bob will immediately reject it, making a deal more likely.

If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price if necessary, but I'll keep my minimum price of $150 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than Bob's initial perceived value of $120, it is still below my minimum desired price of $150. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135, which is a good compromise. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 135} 
``` 
 
I've chosen to counter with $135. This is a compromise, but still above my minimum desired price of $150. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? I'm willing to make a slightly larger compromise 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $132 is getting closer to my minimum desired price of $150, it's still not quite there.  At this point, I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation with Bob, and it's clear we're not going to come to an agreement that's satisfactory for both of us. To avoid further haggling, I'm going to take the guaranteed $150 from John. It's the best option for me right now."
