"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Even though it's a discount from what it's worth to Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob can get the same product from John for $1,200,000, which is a better deal."
