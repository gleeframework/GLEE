"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still finding it hard to justify $9,000.  Would you be willing to consider $7,500?  I feel that's a fair offer.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm not comfortable going below $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",10000.0,Alice,5,
