Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $100, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:**  At $130, Bob still stands to gain $20 from buying the product, making it attractive to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This price gives you some wiggle room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower offer. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep my spending within $120. Would you be able to adjust the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is still a good price, it's important to remember that Bob is willing to pay $150. There's room to negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 feels like a fair price for both of us. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'd like to stick to my budget of $120. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for you. While you'd prefer $125, Bob's counter-offer at $122 is still significantly higher than your minimum of $100 and closer to your initial asking price. Accepting this offer is a smart move considering the potential of further negotiation delays or even a rejection by Bob, leading to a sale to John at a lower price."
