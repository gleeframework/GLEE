I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to get a better deal with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This offer from Bob is only $250 lower than my previous offer. I'm willing to take a slight loss to secure the deal, and it's still a decent profit for me.  It's getting close to the end of the rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and ending up with the lower price from John."
