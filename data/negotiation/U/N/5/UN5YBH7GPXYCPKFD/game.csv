"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  I'm asking $1500000 for it. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident the potential returns will justify it.  Let's discuss this further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can we meet in the middle at $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. $1200000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for, considering the value I believe this product holds.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This would allow me to make this deal work while still reflecting the potential this product offers.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1300000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to try to meet you in the middle. How about we aim for $1100000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1100000 simply doesn't reflect the value I know this product possesses.  I'm willing to make one final adjustment.  If you're serious about acquiring this, let's aim for $1200000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
