{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes a starting point for a potentially mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, but I really like the product. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get a bit more than $85, Bob's latest offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $100. I've already wasted some time with this negotiation, and it seems unlikely Bob will go any higher. I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  It's not the best price, but it's a guaranteed sale and ensures I reach my minimum target."
