Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it, but my budget allows me to spend no more than $80 on this purchase. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, Alice. However, I still feel that $80 would be a fair price for both of us. Could we possibly meet at that point?

Bob is clearly anchored at $80 and unlikely to budge. Accepting his offer would leave money on the table, and further haggling is unlikely to result in a significantly better outcome.  It's time to move on to John and secure the guaranteed $80."
