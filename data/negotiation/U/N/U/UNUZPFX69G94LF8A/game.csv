"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique and high-quality item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",90.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $75? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $75. I appreciate your interest in the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down, Alice.  $82.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $80. Let's see if we can make this work.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to go below $85. I think this product is worth more than that, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin. Would you be willing to meet me at $84?",84.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, $84 is still too much for me. I'm happy to split the difference and offer you $82. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",82.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go below $83. I think this product is worth more than that, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin. Would you be willing to meet me at $83?",83.0,Alice,7,
