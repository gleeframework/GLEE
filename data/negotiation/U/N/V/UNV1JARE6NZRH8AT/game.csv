"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $120 for the product.  This would still be a great price for you, considering how much you value the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'd like to get as close to $80 as possible. Can you meet me at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
