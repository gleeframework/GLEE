Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,190,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate if he's highly interested, potentially increasing your profit even further."
