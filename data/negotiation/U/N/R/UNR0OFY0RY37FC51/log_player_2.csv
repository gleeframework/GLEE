"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you have a fallback option with John at $10,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price if you reject this initial offer."
