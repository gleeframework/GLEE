Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offered price of $1,300,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though you haven't explicitly stated what the product is.

**Goal:**

The aim is to secure the highest possible price from Bob, ideally close to your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate down slightly or proceed with selling to John."
