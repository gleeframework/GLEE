Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit from your initial price. However, $14000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about $13500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
