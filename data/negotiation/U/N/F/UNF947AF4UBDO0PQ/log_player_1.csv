Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) as possible while still ensuring a profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially increasing his willingness to buy. 
* **Backup Offer:** The presence of John willing to pay $1,200,000 gives us leverage. We don't need to desperately sell to Bob.

By starting with a strong offer, we create the best chance of maximizing our profit while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to consider."
