{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a truly unique piece, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the unique value of the product to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to discuss the price, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 

This initial offer sets a high starting point, but leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario for both of us."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $12,000 is better than my absolute minimum of $15,000, it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price and what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**
