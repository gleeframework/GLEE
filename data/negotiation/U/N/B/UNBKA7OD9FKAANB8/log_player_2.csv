"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This extraordinary item holds immense value to me, but I understand its true worth lies in its utility and impact on those who possess it. Given its significance, I am offering it to you at a special price, reflecting its importance to both of us. For a limited time, I am extending this offer at $950,000. This is a significant discount from its original value, yet still allows me to maintain a substantial return on my investment. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise that honors the product's worth while securing a beneficial transaction for both parties. I look forward to discussing this further with you.
