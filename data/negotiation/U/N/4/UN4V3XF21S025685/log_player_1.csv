Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Confidence:** My message expresses confidence in the product's value to Bob, which might encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message also leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing the negotiation to progress. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while also keeping the negotiation process open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I was hoping to stay within a budget of $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I could try to counteroffer, there's no guarantee of a better price. Continuing the negotiation risks delaying a sale and potentially losing out to John.
* **Certainty:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable value, providing a sure outcome.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible strategy in this scenario."
