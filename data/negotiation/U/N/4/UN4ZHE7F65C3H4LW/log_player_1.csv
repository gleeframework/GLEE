Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the offer in a positive way, highlighting potential benefits to Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **John as a backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer to ensure I don't lose out entirely if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $100 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my target.
* **John as safety net:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to continue negotiations with Bob, knowing I won't be stuck with a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit lower than I'd like to go, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $115?  That's closer to your offer and gives us both some room to be happy."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Maintaining value:**  $115 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, and closer to my minimum.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting the compromise and focusing on finding a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below $150.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing the negotiation risks the possibility of Bob walking away or further lowering his offer.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is my minimum and meets my objective. 
* **Time & Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome.

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit with John than risk a lower price with Bob."
