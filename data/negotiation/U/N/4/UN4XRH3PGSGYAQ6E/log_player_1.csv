Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, as that's her guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit higher, getting Alice closer to her ideal price.
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly might be slightly more advantageous even if the final price is a bit lower than $12,000, but this factor isn't heavily emphasized in the scenario.

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice doesn't know Bob's exact valuation of $10,000. If she had that information, she could tailor her offer more strategically."
