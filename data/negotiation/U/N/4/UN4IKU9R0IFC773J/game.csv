"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a reasonable profit for me. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
