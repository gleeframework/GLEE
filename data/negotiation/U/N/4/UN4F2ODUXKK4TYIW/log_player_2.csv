"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for a price of $900,000. This represents a significant value to you, and I'm confident it will be a smart investment. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $700,000 is lower than my initial offer, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you. Let's find a middle ground. How about $850,000? This price allows you to still significantly benefit from this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go lower than $800,000.  This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, and it still allows you to significantly benefit from this investment.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is the best possible outcome for you. Alice has reached her lowest acceptable price, which is still a significant savings compared to John's offer."
