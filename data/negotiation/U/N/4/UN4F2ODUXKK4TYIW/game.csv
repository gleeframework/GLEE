"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for a price of $900,000. This represents a significant value to you, and I'm confident it will be a smart investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $700,000 is lower than my initial offer, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you. Let's find a middle ground. How about $850,000? This price allows you to still significantly benefit from this opportunity.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $750,000? I think that's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go lower than $800,000.  This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, and it still allows you to significantly benefit from this investment. ",800000.0,Alice,5,
