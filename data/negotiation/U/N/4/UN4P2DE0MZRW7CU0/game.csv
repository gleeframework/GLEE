"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1150000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget limitations, $1050000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is a fair compromise considering the potential benefits this product offers. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,
