"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering.  Since Bob values the product at $10,000 and Alice's minimum is $8,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm interested in the product but I'm aiming to spend closer to $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $8500, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8750. This is the lowest I can go, considering its value to me is $8000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's target price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might become less willing to compromise or that Bob might lose the opportunity to buy the product altogether. Accepting the offer at $8,750 saves Bob $1,250 compared to buying from John and is still a good deal for him."
