"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle again?",11500.0,Bob,4,
