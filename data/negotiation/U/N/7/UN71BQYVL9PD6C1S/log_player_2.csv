"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Given its quality and unique features, it's a great investment for anyone looking to enhance their experience. Considering its worth and your potential interest, I propose a special introductory price of $120 for you. This is an excellent opportunity to secure this item at a discounted rate before we potentially increase the price in the future. If you're interested, please let me know so we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's offer of $120 is lower than her stated value, it's still significantly higher than your $80 maximum and John's offer. You can do better by rejecting this offer."
