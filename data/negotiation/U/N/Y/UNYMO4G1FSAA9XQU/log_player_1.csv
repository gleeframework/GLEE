You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently lowering his offer, but he's still offering significantly more than John's $10,000.  We're getting into risky territory, but it's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing that we're both invested in making this deal work. I'm willing to accept a lower price than I initially planned, how about $12,250?"", ""product_price"": 12250} 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer aims to meet Bob somewhere near the middle of his last offer and our previous counteroffer. It shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  Bob is still unwilling to meet closer to our desired price. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk he'll continue to lowball or that we'll reach a stalemate. Accepting his $11,500 offer ensures we make a significant profit above John's $10,000 offer and avoids the risk of missing out on a deal altogether."
