{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I'd like to offer you. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $100. Would you be interested?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be interested in the product and we can work out a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I am willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
