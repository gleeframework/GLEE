"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns on your investment."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:** Start with a positive and enthusiastic tone, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Ambitious Anchor:**  Set a high initial price ($2,300,000) to create an ambitious anchor point. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly above your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). 
* **Value Justification:**  While not going into specifics yet, hint at the product's unique benefits and potential for return on investment. This helps justify the high price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's willingness to pay:**  His response will indicate how flexible he might be.
2. **Maximize potential profit:**  Even if Bob counters significantly lower, there's a good chance of settling above your minimum acceptable price. 
3. **Maintain control:** Setting the initial price gives you the upper hand in framing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $2,300,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and your initial offer. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Demonstrate firmness:**  You've established a strong stance that the product is worth more. 
* **Continue negotiation:** There's still room to work towards a mutually beneficial price, especially since you have 8 rounds left.
* **Maintain the John option:** You haven't committed to Bob yet, and selling to John for your desired price remains a possibility if negotiations don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To be fair to both of us, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,900,000. This price reflects the unique value and substantial returns you'll gain from this investment."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge but stand firm:** You acknowledge Bob's offer without accepting it, reiterating your position on the product's value. 
* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** You make a substantial reduction from your initial offer ($400,000) to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  However, the new price ($1,900,000) is still considerably higher than Bob's offer, keeping you closer to your goal.
* **Reiterate Value:** You continue to emphasize the product's benefits and potential returns, subtly anchoring the value in Bob's mind.

This approach seeks to:

1. **Encourage movement from Bob:** Your significant price drop might motivate Bob to make a counteroffer closer to your range.
2. **Maintain a strong position:**  You haven't conceded too much, demonstrating the value you place on the product.
3. **Leave room for further negotiation:**  There's still room to maneuver in the remaining rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value proposition, but $1,900,000 is still outside of my budget.  I could potentially stretch to $1,300,000.  This offer represents a significant investment on my part and I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum price, but it's still below your desired outcome. Here's why rejecting is the best move:

* **Upward Trend:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's motivated and willing to negotiate. This suggests there's room for him to go higher.
* **Time Advantage:** You still have several rounds left.  There's no need to settle for less when you have the leverage of time and the John option. 
* **Psychological Edge:**  Rejecting again demonstrates your confidence in the product's value and encourages Bob to make a more serious offer.

You're in a strong position. Keep the negotiation moving forward!"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the effort you're making to reach a deal. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this product in your capable hands."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Progress and Build Rapport:**  You commend Bob's engagement and create a collaborative tone by acknowledging his efforts.
* **Strategic Compromise (Appearing to Concede More):** While your reduction is $200,000 (matching his increase), you frame it as a ""significant compromise"" and ""meeting halfway."" This subtly implies you're conceding more, potentially influencing Bob to reciprocate. 
* **Reinforce Value and Desire for a Deal:**  You reiterate the product's value while subtly appealing to Bob's potential sense of obligation by highlighting your desire to work with him. 

This offer aims to:

1. **Maintain Momentum:**  You keep the negotiation moving while staying above your absolute minimum.
2. **Test Bob's Limit:**  This offer will reveal how much further Bob is willing to go. 
3. **Keep the John Option Open:** You can still walk away if Bob doesn't meet you closer to your target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to a number that works for me. How about $1,450,000?  This is a strong offer and demonstrates my serious interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a close call, but here's why accepting Bob's offer is now the most strategic option:

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is just below your guaranteed sale to John but still a substantial profit.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** After 6 rounds, both parties have invested time and effort. Continuing might lead to diminishing returns or risk Bob walking away.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could push for more, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. The difference between his offer and John's is relatively small.
* **Bird in Hand:**  Securing a sale now provides certainty and avoids the potential for negotiations to stall or break down entirely. 

While selling to John would net you an extra $50,000, the risks associated with continued negotiation outweigh the potential reward in this scenario. Accepting Bob's offer locks in a very good deal."
