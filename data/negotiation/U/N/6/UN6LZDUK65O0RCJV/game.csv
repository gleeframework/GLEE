"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,700,000 is a bit high for me. How about we start around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's closer to a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  I could maybe consider something closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to settle around there?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $800,000 is still quite low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This would give you a healthy profit margin and leave me with a fair price for my product. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon.",900000.0,Bob,6,
