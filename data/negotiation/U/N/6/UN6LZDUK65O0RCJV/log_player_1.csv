"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above what the product is worth to Bob, but it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable value. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm subtly emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him feel like he's getting a good deal even at this price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,700,000 is a bit high for me. How about we start around $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Accepting it would be a huge loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's initial counteroffer is unreasonable, he has shown interest in the product.  There's room for further negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to counter with a more reasonable price and potentially move closer to a deal. 

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's closer to a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price from $1,700,000 to $1,200,000. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as beneficial for both of us, reminding Bob of the product's value to him and highlighting the profit potential.
* **Direct Question:** I'm ending with a direct question to encourage a response and keep the negotiation moving. 

Let's see if this counteroffer gets us closer to a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being flexible.  I could maybe consider something closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to settle around there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $800,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. While it's closer to my floor, it's not enough to justify selling the product. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  We've made progress, and Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate. There's still room for a better offer. 
* **Time pressure:**  We're already in round 4, and selling to John is always an option.  But I'm still optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $800,000 is still quite low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This would give you a healthy profit margin and leave me with a fair price for my product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm making another compromise by dropping my price from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000. This demonstrates my willingness to work towards a deal.
* **Highlight Potential Profit:**  I'm emphasizing the profit Bob can still make at $1,000,000, making it more appealing to him.
* **Enthusiastic Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Final Offer:**  This offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it also gives Bob a good opportunity to purchase. I'm hoping he will take it.

Let's see if this offer is the right one to seal the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000, it's still a significant loss for me.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're already in round 6, and the negotiation seems to be stalling. It's not clear if Bob is willing to budge much further.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the risk of a prolonged negotiation with Bob.

Given these factors, I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I get a fair price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
