"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to sell to Bob, I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $15,000 is still a bit higher than I had hoped. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle, say, at $12,000? That would be my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I could keep negotiating, it's starting to get time-consuming, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  I'm going to sell to John for $15,000."
