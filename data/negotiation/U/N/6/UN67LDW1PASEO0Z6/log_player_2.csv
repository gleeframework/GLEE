"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than what Bob is willing to pay, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500. This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly higher than what the product is worth to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is still a good deal for Bob, as he is willing to pay up to $12,000. Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John.  While there might be potential for further negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially ending up buying from John at a higher price outweighs the potential benefit of saving an additional $500."
