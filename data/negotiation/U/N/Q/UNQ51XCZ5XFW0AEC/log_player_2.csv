{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $10,500 is a strong counteroffer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness while still leaving room for negotiation. This price is also closer to Alice's value of $10,000, making it more likely she'll consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer to $11,000.  While this is a better price than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's target.  There is still opportunity for negotiation, and Bob should continue to try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer from $10,500 to $10,750, showing he's willing to compromise but still aiming for a good deal.  This offer is closer to Alice's offer of $11,000 and may encourage her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,900 is a good price and closer to Bob's target, there's still potential to get it even lower.  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and Bob can likely secure a better deal with a final counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is close to his target price, and he's shown a willingness to compromise.  Offering $10,800 is a slight increase from his previous offer, demonstrating that he's serious about closing the deal, but it's still lower than Alice's offer of $10,900. This could be the final push to get Alice to accept the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has negotiated down to a price that's very close to his target. While he could try for a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially driving the price back up is high.  It's more advantageous to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
