"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a significant return on investment for you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the potential value of the product, that price is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 as a starting point for further negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation. While I understand your perspective, the  $800,000 offer significantly undervalues the product's true potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial adjustment that demonstrates my willingness to find common ground.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, we're still quite far apart on price.  To be frank, anything over $1,100,000 is going to be a very difficult sell for me.  I'm proposing that figure in the spirit of compromise and hope we can find some middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and I understand where you're coming from. However, we need to find a price point that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to drop to $1,650,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits you stand to gain.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm sensing that we might be at an impasse. While I believe the product has value, exceeding my budget won't work. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options, even though I'd prefer to work with you.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a significant decision for you, and I respect your position.  I've tried to be flexible throughout our negotiations. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for the full asking price. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value the potential partnership we've discussed.  I'm willing to accept $1,450,000 as my final offer. This is a considerable compromise on my end and reflects my commitment to making this deal work. ",1450000.0,Alice,7,
