"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $10,750, which would be $11,125. I think that's a fair price for the value this product offers. What do you think?",11125.0,Alice,5,
