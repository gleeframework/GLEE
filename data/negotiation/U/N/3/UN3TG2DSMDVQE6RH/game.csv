"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is a good price for you, but I'm still looking to get as close to my target as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $80. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. What do you think?",80.0,Alice,5,
