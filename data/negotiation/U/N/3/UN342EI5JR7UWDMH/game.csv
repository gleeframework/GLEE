"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $900,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to facilitate the deal. This price still provides you with a considerable advantage, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this investment. Let's try to find a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,000,000.  Would you consider $950,000?  That would make this a very attractive deal for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to stay below $1,000,000, but $950,000 is still quite far from my bottom line. I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000, as a final offer.  This price still represents a good value for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
