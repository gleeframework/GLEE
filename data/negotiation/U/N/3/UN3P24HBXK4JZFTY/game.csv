"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $10250?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my value for the product. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $10250.  I'm willing to go up to $9000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to each of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $9000. However, it's still not quite in the range I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9625. This would still leave you with a great deal, and it's closer to the value I'm seeking. Let's see if we can close the deal.",9625.0,Alice,5,
