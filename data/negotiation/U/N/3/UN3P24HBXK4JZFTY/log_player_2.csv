"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's above his maximum value of $8,000.  He has room to negotiate a better price and should attempt to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $10250?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my value for the product. Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,250 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $8,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a price closer to his target.  He's only in round 3, so he has plenty of time to work with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to each of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $9000. However, it's still not quite in the range I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9625. This would still leave you with a great deal, and it's closer to the value I'm seeking. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,625
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,625 is still above Bob's maximum value of $8,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, he's already had 4 rounds of back-and-forth with Alice and there's no guarantee that he'll be able to get her down to his target price.  At this point, it's better to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $8,000.  This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation that could potentially drag on."
