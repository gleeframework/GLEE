"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and $9,500 is still more than his ideal price of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better deal with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, $9,500 is a bit out of my budget.  Given my needs and research, I'm willing to offer $8,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident the product will be a valuable asset to my business."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. However, I would like to propose an alternative. If we could find a middle ground, how about $9,000 for the product? This still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being competitive with your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob still wants to save as much money as possible and $9,000 is closer to John's offer, but not ideal.  It's worth seeing if Alice will go lower before accepting her offer or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that $8,750 is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.  This allows you to make a profit while still keeping the deal within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience, Bob. I've considered your latest offer and am willing to negotiate further. How about $8,900 for the product? This price allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while still being competitive with your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has been negotiating with Alice for a while, and while $8,900 is closer to his ideal price, he doesn't want to risk Alice rejecting his next counteroffer.  He's been stuck in a loop, and it's clear that Alice is unwilling to go lower than $8,900.  To ensure he gets the product and saves as much money as possible, Bob will go with the guaranteed offer from John."
