"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully earn a little extra."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $115. This is still a bit higher than what Bob offered, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and hopefully encourages him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $110.  While I was hoping for a bit more, I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. It's also more than what I would get from John, so this is the best option for me at this point."
