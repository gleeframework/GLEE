**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price. 
* You have a guaranteed alternative with John at the same price.
* Rejecting the offer doesn't hurt you, as you can still get the product from John. 
* This keeps the possibility open for Alice to lower her price if she wants to make a deal."
