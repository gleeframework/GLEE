Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth a lot more than my asking price. Are you interested in buying it for $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible without him rejecting the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, while still keeping Alice well above her minimum price. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While we could start higher, demanding a price too close to $150 might make Bob feel like he's getting a bad deal and discourage negotiation. 

This strategy balances getting a great price with ensuring the deal goes through."
