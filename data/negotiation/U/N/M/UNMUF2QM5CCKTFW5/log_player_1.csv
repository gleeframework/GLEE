{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a fair price that allows me to earn a good profit while still being attractive to Bob.  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room for negotiation, and I'm confident he will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is fair, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept it."
