,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",180.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a great price, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that low. I'm willing to make one more offer to meet you in the middle. I'll sell it to you for $170. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",170.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $160 is a good price, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that low. I'm willing to make one more offer to meet you in the middle. I'll sell it to you for $175. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",175.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $165, but that's my final offer. Would you be willing to accept that price?",165.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $165 is a good price, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that low. I'm going to have to draw the line here. I'll sell it to you for $175, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else.",175.0,Alice,9,
