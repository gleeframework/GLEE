{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming to get more than your minimum value of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob balks at the price, you can always come down a bit. 
* **It's ambitious:**  You want to maximize your earnings, and this price reflects that ambition.

By starting high and being willing to negotiate, you increase your chances of getting a good price without risking losing the sale entirely."
