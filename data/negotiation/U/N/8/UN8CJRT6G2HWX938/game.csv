"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me. Can you meet me at this price?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm glad we're having this discussion. However, based on our internal evaluations and costs, we're unable to match your proposed price. To continue moving forward, I'd like to suggest a counteroffer of $650000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise while still allowing us to maintain a reasonable margin. Please let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit higher than your new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better. How about $620000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this purchase, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",620000.0,Bob,4,
