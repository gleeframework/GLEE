,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my price range.  How about $90?  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $105.  That way we both get a good deal, and I can get this amazing product without breaking the bank.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up too much profit. How about we meet at $107? I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment.",107.0,Alice,5,
