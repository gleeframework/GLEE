"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market conditions.

I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true value.

"I understand that you're close to reaching a decision, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,225,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,5,
