{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to counteroffer if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm offering $9,250, which is still a good profit for me and a fair price considering the value to Bob.  I'm hoping this will be a good compromise, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $9,000 is a good price for me, and it seems like we've reached a compromise.  I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
