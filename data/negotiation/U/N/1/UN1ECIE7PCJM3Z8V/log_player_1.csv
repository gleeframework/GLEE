{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate. It's important to be friendly and open to discussion to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price. While it's tempting to accept $11,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your desired price, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $11,000, which would be $11,500. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum.  While I could continue to negotiate, I'm confident that John is willing to buy the product at my minimum price of $12,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially losing out on a guaranteed sale."
