"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering its value to me.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your desired price, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $11,000, which would be $11,500. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher.",11500.0,Bob,4,
