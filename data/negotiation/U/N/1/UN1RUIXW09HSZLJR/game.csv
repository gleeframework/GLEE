,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $105? This price is still fair for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal!",100.0,Alice,5,
