Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $10,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is slowly coming down on her price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly better than John's offer of $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of the price remaining above your backup option."
