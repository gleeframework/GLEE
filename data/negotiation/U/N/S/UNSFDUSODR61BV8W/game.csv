"I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That's still a great deal for a product like this.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product and I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
