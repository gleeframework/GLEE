"Alice, $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on your product. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low. Considering the value of the product and my initial offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $1,200,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,000,000 is still not enough for me.  Considering your previous offer and the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This is a final price that reflects a fair compromise. Let me know your decision.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the value we both place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. ",1050000.0,Bob,6,
