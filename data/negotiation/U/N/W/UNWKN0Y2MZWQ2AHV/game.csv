"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still well within your value range.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I bring to the table.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  This is a reasonable price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. Let's make this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not sure if $825,000 is enough to justify the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I believe this is the sweet spot that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
