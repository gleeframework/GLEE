Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $120, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While $120 is my ideal price, I'm open to negotiation as long as I can get at least my minimum of $100. 
* **Friendly tone:** Keeping the message friendly and inviting can help encourage Bob to negotiate rather than simply rejecting my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Would you consider accepting $105 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is within my minimum:**  $105 is above my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Negotiating further risks wasting time and potentially losing Bob as a buyer.  
* **John's offer is a backup:**  I know I can get $100 from John, but $105 is better. It's worth taking the deal to secure the sale."
