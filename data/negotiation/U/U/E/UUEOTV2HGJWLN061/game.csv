"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
