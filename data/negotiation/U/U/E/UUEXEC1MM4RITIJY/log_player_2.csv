"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering. There's a clear gap between Alice's desired price ($12,000) and her offer ($14,500).  This indicates room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $13,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice has come down from $14,500, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering again, aiming for a price closer to $13,500."
