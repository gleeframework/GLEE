"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit,  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $1,750,000. This gives us both a fair deal.  Let's close this deal, what do you say?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,750,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
