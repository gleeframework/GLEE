You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** Even though it's lower than John's price, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($800,000). This means there's likely room for further negotiation. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows for potential counter-offers from Alice.** By rejecting, you signal that you're not satisfied with the price, prompting Alice to potentially come down further.
* **Buying from John is the fallback option.** It's only better than accepting Alice's offer if you can't negotiate a lower price."
