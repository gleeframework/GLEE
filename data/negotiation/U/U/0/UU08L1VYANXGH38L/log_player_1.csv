""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique nature and your specific needs, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I am confident this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (your minimum), starting negotiations significantly higher allows room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your fallback option.
* **Justification:**  While the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, framing the price around ""unique nature"" and ""potential return on investment"" shifts the focus to value rather than a fixed cost. This might make Bob more receptive to a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $2,000,000 doesn't mean that's the final price. Bob might negotiate, and you can potentially meet somewhere in the middle, still earning significantly more than your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob highly values the product and that its benefits to him outweigh the higher cost. It's essential to gauge Bob's interest and adjust your negotiation approach accordingly."
