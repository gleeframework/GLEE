"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the special deal.  However, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that 105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for 108. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that 106 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for 109. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",109.0,Alice,5,
