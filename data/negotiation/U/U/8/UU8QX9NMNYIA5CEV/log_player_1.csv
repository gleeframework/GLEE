{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaving room for negotiation. This way, I maximize my potential earnings while still giving Bob the opportunity to engage in a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $130.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $130 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $155.  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find this product for a better price anywhere else. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 155}
