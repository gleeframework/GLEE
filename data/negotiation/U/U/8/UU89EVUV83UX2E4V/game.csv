"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and allows for a good profit margin for you. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. This price gives you a healthy profit and allows me to get a good deal.  What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original price.  How about $1,075,000? This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,075,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal and avoids going to John.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
