"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than the product's value to her ($800,000).  There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and potentially secure a lower price."

Round 2

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original price.  How about $1,075,000? This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.
