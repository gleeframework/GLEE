Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price that's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** Offering $12,000 gives Bob some room to counter, allowing us to potentially find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Considering John's offer:** While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for the higher price, I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob break down, I have a guaranteed alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Not risking John's offer:**  I don't want to risk losing John's offer of $15,000 just yet. 

I'm going to counteroffer Bob in the next round, hoping to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, giving me a good profit margin.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate further. If he accepts, I get a decent deal. If he rejects, I can either try a final counteroffer or move on to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation stalled:** Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable value, and it seems like he's unwilling to budge much further.
* **Risk of further decline:**  If I reject his offer and try another counteroffer, there's a risk that Bob will continue to lower his offer, potentially making the deal even less favorable.
* **Secure alternative:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable value and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  

While I would have preferred to sell to Bob for a higher price, securing a guaranteed $15,000 is the most logical choice at this point."
