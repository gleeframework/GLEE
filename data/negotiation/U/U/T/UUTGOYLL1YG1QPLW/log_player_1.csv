"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a price of $800,000 for the product. I believe this aligns closely with its worth to you and also stays within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get more from Bob.  He clearly values the product at $1,000,000 and has already shown a willingness to negotiate.  I'll counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit more to $850,000. This still allows me to get a fair return on my investment, and I believe it's a reasonable offer considering the value you place on the product.  Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given your position and the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $825,000. I hope this proposal helps us reach an agreement that is fair to both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is only $25,000 less than my last counteroffer.  Given that we're already in round 4, and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's a good time to close the deal.  I don't want to risk losing the sale by pushing for more."
