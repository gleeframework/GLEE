"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering your own valuation and my need to cover my costs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $12,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",12750.0,Bob,4,
