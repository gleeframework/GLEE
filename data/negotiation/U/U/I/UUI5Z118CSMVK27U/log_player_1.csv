Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have significant leverage. Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit margin.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value and potential"" adds perceived value, justifying the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob's input, leaving space for negotiation if he balks at the initial price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's interest and keeping the door open for a successful deal."
