"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I appreciate your honesty about your budget, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $9,500 is closer to what I envisioned, I'm still seeking a bit more for this product. Would you consider $10,750? This reflects the true value while acknowledging your budget constraints.",10750.0,Alice,5,
