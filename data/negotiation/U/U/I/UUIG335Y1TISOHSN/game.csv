Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?,110.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $105? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $105 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $95. Would that work for you?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $95. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really like the product at this price.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for trying to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to bump my offer up slightly to $97.  That's about as high as I can go.",97.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to bump up your offer. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to try to find a compromise. How about we meet at $101? It's still a bit above my minimum, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",101.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I can do $98, but that's really the best I can offer.",98.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close as possible to your target. I'm willing to meet you at $99, but that's the absolute limit for me. I think it's a fair price for the product, and I hope we can finally agree on a deal.",99.0,Alice,9,
