"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product but I'm only willing to pay $75 at this time. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $85? I'm confident you'll find the product worth it at that price.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still keen on getting your product, but $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $80? That's my absolute top price.",80.0,Bob,4,
