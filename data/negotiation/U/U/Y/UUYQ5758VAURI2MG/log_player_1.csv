{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It is higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, you can then consider lowering the price slightly or see if he's willing to offer a higher counter-price.  Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $100 if you're not satisfied with the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $120 for this product. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, it's worth trying to get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $105? This would still be a great deal for you and closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $102? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$102 is a fair price considering Bob's budget and my own minimum. I'll accept his offer and avoid any further negotiation."
