"Alice,  your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, but I need to stay within that range to make this purchase worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,900,000? I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still outside my acceptable range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value and my budget limitations.  Let's try to bridge the gap and finalize the deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
