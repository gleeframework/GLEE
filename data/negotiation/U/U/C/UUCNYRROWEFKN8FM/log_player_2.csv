"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $12,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000, but you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting and counteroffering gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $11,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's offer of $15,000, and it's likely that further negotiation won't result in a much lower price.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid risking the negotiation breaking down."
