"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  By rejecting, you can start a counteroffer negotiation and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $9,500? It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. It's still a good deal for both of us, considering what the product is worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has come down to $10,500, which is still more than what you can get from John. There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice as you can get the product for $10,000 from John."
