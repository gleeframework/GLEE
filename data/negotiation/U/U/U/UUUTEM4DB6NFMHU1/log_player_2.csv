Round 2

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $10,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
