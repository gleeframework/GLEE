"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to go down to $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is still too low for me.  How about $110? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $110 is still a little high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $108.  Let's make this deal happen!",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $108 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $109?  That way we both get a good deal.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but $109 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we finalize this at $107?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",107.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $107 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $108.  Let's close this deal!",108.0,Alice,7,
