"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  You can try to counteroffer at a lower price and see if she's willing to meet you in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to go down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is still too low for me.  How about $110? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's still worth negotiating with Alice.  You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so you have a good baseline. Let's see if we can get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $110 is still a little high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $108.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $108 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $109?  That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting closer to your target price of $100. Let's try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but $109 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we finalize this at $107?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 107}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $107 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $108.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is $108, which is still higher than John's offer of $100.  It's better to go with the sure thing and buy from John.  There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further."
