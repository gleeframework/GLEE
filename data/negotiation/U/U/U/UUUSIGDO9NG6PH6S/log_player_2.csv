Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you sticking with this, but $75 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  That way we're both meeting in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5

While Alice is attempting to meet in the middle, $82.50 is still more than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It makes more financial sense to go with John's offer at this point."
