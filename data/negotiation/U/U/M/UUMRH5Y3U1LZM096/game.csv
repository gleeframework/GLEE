"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you. Let me know if you're interested!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This reflects the value of the product to me while still giving you a great deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, so my counteroffer is $9,750. I hope we can come to an agreement.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $9,750 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference.  I'll accept $10,125 for the product.  This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",10125.0,Alice,5,
