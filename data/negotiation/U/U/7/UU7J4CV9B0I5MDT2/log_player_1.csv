Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer and the discussion.  While $1,500,000 is certainly a strong starting point, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial proposal. Would you consider $1,650,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,650,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,500,000 and $1,650,000, so I'll offer $1,575,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,575,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and negotiating. While his offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to push for a better price.  We'll counteroffer in Round 5, aiming for a figure between his current offer and our previous one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're definitely right that we're getting closer.  To meet you partway, how about $1,612,500? I believe that strikes a fair balance and reflects the true value of this product."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,575,000, but I'd like to propose a slight reduction to $1,587,500. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, but also takes into account my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,587,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,587,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could likely push Bob a little further, accepting his offer of $1,587,500 represents a significant profit above our minimum ($1,200,000) and avoids the risk of him walking away. It's a solid deal at this stage in the negotiation."
