"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum desired price, but it's still above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial rejection, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I have 9 rounds left, and John is a good backup option, but I'm hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I come down to $1,075,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about we meet at $1050000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push Bob higher with my next counteroffer. I have 6 rounds left before I need to seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $1,062,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal, I'm ready to finalize the details."", ""product_price"": 1062500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about we meet at $1050000? I'm willing to make a decision today if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I need to be realistic. I've already made several concessions, and Bob is still unwilling to budge much.  I have only 4 rounds left, and I'm not confident I can reach a price that meets my minimum acceptable value. It's time to move on and secure the deal with John, ensuring I receive the full value for the product."
