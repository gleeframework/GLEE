"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,100,000? This price still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your latest offer, and while I appreciate the adjustment, I am still unable to meet you at $1,100,000. I would like to propose $1,050,000 as a potential compromise. I hope this offer is within your acceptable range.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
