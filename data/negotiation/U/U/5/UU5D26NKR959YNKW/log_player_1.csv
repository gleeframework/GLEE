{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than what it's worth to me. It leaves room for negotiation without risking losing Bob as a buyer completely.  I'll keep John's offer of $12,000 in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, as it's below my minimum price of $12,000. It's better to try and negotiate further with Bob before considering selling to John.  I'll make a counteroffer closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $9,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I still believe $8,000 is a fair price for the product. I hope this meets your needs and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on his $8,000 price, which is significantly below my minimum.  While I could continue to negotiate, I'm confident that I can secure a better deal with John.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $12,000."
