"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price is still a fair value for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is tempting, it doesn't fully reflect the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,300,000, which still provides us both with a substantial gain. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
