"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Would you like to start by discussing your expectations for this product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a decent offer, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating. Since Bob's maximum is $120, rejecting and counter-offering is a logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $120.  Would you be willing to consider $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob wants to start the negotiation by getting closer to his maximum price.  Offering $125 is a strong opening move, showing that he's serious about buying the product but is willing to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Counter:**  $125 is a reasonable counteroffer, leaving some room for further negotiation while still being significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.
* **Open Communication:**  Bob's message is friendly and encourages a dialogue, showing a willingness to work with Alice to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to meet somewhere in the middle. My counteroffer for the product would be $137.50. I believe this offers a fair compromise considering the value both of us place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $137.50 is still above his maximum.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer, but $137.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $130? I think this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:**  Bob is showing persistence and a willingness to keep negotiating, but he's also demonstrating that he's not afraid to walk away.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  $130 is another step closer to Bob's desired price but still leaves some room for Alice to make a counteroffer without feeling like she's giving too much away.
* **Maintaining Dialogue:**  The message reiterates that Bob is looking for a mutually agreeable solution, emphasizing that they are both working towards a common goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I propose a price of $132.50 for the product. This offer aims to find a balance between our respective valuations while moving forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer has moved closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his maximum of $120.  He can still try to negotiate a lower price, and it's worth seeing if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $132.50 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to make a final offer of $127.50. This is the absolute most I can do, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we both place on the product."", ""product_price"": 127.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob is showing that he's reaching his limit, making this a ""take it or leave it"" offer.
* **Slightly Above Maximum:**  Offering $127.50 shows that Bob is genuinely trying to reach a deal, but he's also staying within a reasonable range.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and leaves no room for misinterpretation. It emphasizes that this is Bob's final offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Reiterating Value:** Bob again mentions the value of the product to both parties to justify his final offer."

Round 7

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $129.50 is still above Bob's maximum of $120.  While they've come close,  it's not worth risking further negotiation at this point.  Given the limited rounds remaining, Bob is better off buying from John for his desired price."
