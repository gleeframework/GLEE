The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice's offer is $95. It's a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. I'll reject and make a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}

I'm offering $90 for the product. This is still a good deal for Alice, as it's above her value of $80, and it's a step closer to my target price of $100."

Alice is coming down, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject and make another counteroffer."

Round 4

I'll stick with my strategy of gradually lowering the price, offering $91 this time.  It's a reasonable compromise, and hopefully, Alice will accept."

``` 

While Alice's offer of $93 is better than her previous offer, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll reject and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 92}

I'll offer $92 this time, as it's a fair compromise between our previous offers. It's likely Alice will accept, as we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price."

Alice is willing to go up to $94, which is a better deal than buying from John for $100.  It's time to close this deal and accept the offer."
