"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

You can do better than $11,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $10,800. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,800 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still not the best deal for you. You can likely negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,800 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $10,200.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10200}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,200 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $10,600. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could potentially continue negotiating, $10,600 is a good price and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. It's unlikely you'll get a better price from Alice, and you risk losing the deal altogether."
