I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000.  This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm counteroffering at $13,500.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving me with a good profit."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

With only two rounds left, I'm not confident Bob will come up to my desired price.  Selling to John for $10,000 is still a better deal than accepting Bob's current offer.  I need to secure the sale and guarantee a profit."
