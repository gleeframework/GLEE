"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $925,000.  I'm open to discussing further, but I believe this reflects a fair starting point considering the value it holds.",925000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $750,000  is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $890,000. This offer still presents a great deal for you considering its potential.",890000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $890,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $925,000, so I'm thinking $857,500. This is my final offer.",857500.0,Bob,4,
