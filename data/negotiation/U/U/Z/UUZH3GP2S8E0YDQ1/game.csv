"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $700,000 is quite a bit lower than I could consider.  This product is worth a significant investment. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $875,000 is still stretching my budget.  How about we settle on $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. How about we split the difference and settle at $825,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated. While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Could you consider $775,000?  This would allow me to make this investment comfortably.",775000.0,Bob,6,
