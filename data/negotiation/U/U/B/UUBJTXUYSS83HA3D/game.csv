"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to enhance your daily life with its unique features and high-quality materials. Considering its value and benefits, I would like to propose an offer of $100 for it. Looking forward to your response!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $100 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget of $100.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To move forward, I am proposing a counteroffer of $95 for the product. This allows us to find a middle ground while still ensuring we receive a fair return for our efforts.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. Can we meet in the middle at $92.50?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your concern about finding the right balance between cost and value. In light of this, I propose a counteroffer of $91 for the product. This allows us to stay within your budget while also ensuring a reasonable profit margin for us.",91.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $91 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $92.50. If you're willing to accept this, I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase.",92.5,Bob,6,
