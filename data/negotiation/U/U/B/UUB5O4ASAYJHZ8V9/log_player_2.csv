"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $12,000? This gives you a significant savings and still leaves me a comfortable profit. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000. 
* **Alice's Offer:**  Alice is offering $12,000, which is a significant saving for Bob.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer and ultimately Bob might end up paying $15,000 to John. 

Accepting the offer at $12,000 ensures a good deal for Bob and avoids the risk of losing the product."
