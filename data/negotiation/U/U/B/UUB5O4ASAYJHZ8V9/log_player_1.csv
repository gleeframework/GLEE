{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal while still leaving me with a profit significantly higher than selling to John. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $12,000? This gives you a significant savings and still leaves me a comfortable profit. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
