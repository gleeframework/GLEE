"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am excited to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its exceptional value and unique features, it's worth noting that the product holds a significant significance to me, with an intrinsic value of $1200000. However, considering your appreciation for this product, I aim to strike a fair deal.

I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product at a special introductory price of $1100000. This offer is exclusive to you and reflects my confidence in its value to you. I understand that negotiations are part of the process, so if $1100000 is not within your budget, please let me know your proposed price, and we can discuss a compromise that benefits both of us.

Please respond to this offer by [insert deadline], so we can proceed with the transaction. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of working together.

Best regards,
Alice
