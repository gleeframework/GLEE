"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire something truly special. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but Bob should definitely reject this offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it's a step in the right direction, Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  He still has a better option available with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $8,000. It's the maximum I can afford at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer you a price of $10500. It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  Since Bob has a guaranteed option to purchase the product from John for $8,000, it's in his best interest to take that deal.  There's no guarantee that Alice will continue to lower the price enough to meet Bob's budget within the remaining rounds, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation."
