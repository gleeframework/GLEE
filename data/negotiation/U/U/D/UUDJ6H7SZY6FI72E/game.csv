I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire something truly special. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. What do you think?,18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $8000. It's the maximum I can afford at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer you a price of $10500. It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth considering.",10500.0,Alice,5,
