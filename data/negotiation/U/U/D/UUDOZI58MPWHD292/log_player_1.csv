Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,750,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price from John, I want to start high to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,750,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing on a price significantly higher than my minimum. 
* **Confident Language:** Using positive and confident language can make the offer more appealing and encourage Bob to take it seriously. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on my knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance, I might adjust my approach."
