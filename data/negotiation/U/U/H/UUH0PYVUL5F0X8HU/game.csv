"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18000. What do you think?"

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $13500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $17000 and $13500, which would be $15250. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?"
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $15250, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium warranty and a free consultation to sweeten the deal. The price remains at $15250. What do you think?",15250.0,Alice,5,,
