"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
