"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,125,000. How about we try $1,112,500? I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",1112500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach.  Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $1,118,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true worth of what's on the table.",1118000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,118,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,115,000? I think this is the highest price I can afford and still make a profit.",1115000.0,Bob,6,
