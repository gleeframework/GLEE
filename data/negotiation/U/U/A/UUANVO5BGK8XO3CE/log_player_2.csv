"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $115.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is close to my maximum but there's still room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is a little too low for me. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $110, which is a reasonable compromise and saves me $10 compared to John's price. It's not worth risking further negotiation for a potentially small gain."
