``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation. This is a reasonable starting point, as I want to maximize my profit.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate further. However, I also have the option to sell to John for $8,000, so I won't be afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
