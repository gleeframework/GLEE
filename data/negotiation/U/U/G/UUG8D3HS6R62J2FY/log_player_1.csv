"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows me to see how interested Bob is in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $150 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell at that price. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal with Bob. Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to send a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I still want to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price than my minimum, and we're already halfway through the negotiations. It's a good deal, and accepting it avoids the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of Bob backing out completely."
