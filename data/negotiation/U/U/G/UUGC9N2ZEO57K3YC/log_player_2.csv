Alice is still above your ideal price point. It's worth another round of counteroffers to see if you can get closer to your target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1,125,000 is enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,125,000 and my initial offer of $1,200,000, which would be $1,162,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to accept it.

Alice has come down significantly, and you're likely to save more by accepting her offer than by continuing negotiations or buying from John."
