"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which it will be retracted. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is selling the product for $1,100,000, which is lower than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **You save money:** Accepting Alice's offer means you save $100,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, you are still getting a good deal by paying $1,100,000. Your goal is to save as much money as possible, and accepting Alice's offer achieves that."
