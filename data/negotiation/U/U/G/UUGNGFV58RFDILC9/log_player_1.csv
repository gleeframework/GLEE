Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which it will be retracted."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for negotiation if Bob counters. You can always decrease the price, but you can't increase it after the initial offer.
* **Deadline Creates Urgency:**  A deadline encourages Bob to act quickly and prevents him from delaying the decision indefinitely. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 with John, so you can afford to be firm in negotiations with Bob."
