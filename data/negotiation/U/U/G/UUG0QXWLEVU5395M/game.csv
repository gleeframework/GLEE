"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $65 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be flexible.  $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's meet in the middle.  What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
