"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This price allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also giving you a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
