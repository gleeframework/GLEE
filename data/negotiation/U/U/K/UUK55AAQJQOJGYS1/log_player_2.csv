"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that's fair for both of us.  How does $10,000 sound? Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering $10,000.  It's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Would you consider $9,000?  I think this is a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see that we're both trying to find a price that works for us.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. Would you consider $9,500?  I believe this is still a great deal for you, and we can close the deal quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good deal. You're still saving $2,500 compared to buying from John, and it's likely you won't be able to negotiate a lower price."
