"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that's fair for both of us.  How does $10,000 sound? Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Would you consider $9,000?  I think this is a fair price that benefits us both.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see that we're both trying to find a price that works for us.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. Would you consider $9,500?  I believe this is still a great deal for you, and we can close the deal quickly.",9500.0,Alice,3,
