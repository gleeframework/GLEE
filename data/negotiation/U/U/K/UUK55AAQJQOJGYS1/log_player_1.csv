{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that's fair for both of us.  How does $10,000 sound? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

This offer starts in the middle ground, leaving room for negotiation but still securing a good profit for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Would you consider $9,000?  I think this is a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$9,000 is still a good deal, but Alice can likely get a bit more. It's worth seeing if Bob will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see that we're both trying to find a price that works for us.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. Would you consider $9,500?  I believe this is still a great deal for you, and we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 9500}
