"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,500, which is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Jhon's offer:**  $12,000, which is Bob's maximum budget. 

Since Alice's offer is above Bob's budget, it's not a good deal. However, Jhon's offer is right at the limit, so it's still worth continuing to negotiate with Alice in hopes of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm ready to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's strategy:** Start with a strong counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to Alice's minimum. 
* **Counteroffer justification:** $10,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. It's also closer to Alice's minimum value of $10,000, making it more likely to be accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Jhon's offer:**  $12,000, which is Bob's maximum budget. 

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget than her initial offer, it's still not a good deal. Jhon's offer is still a viable option, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price considering we're both trying to find a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's strategy:** Continue to slowly increase the offer, but remain below Alice's most recent counteroffer. 
* **Counteroffer justification:**  $10,750 is a compromise that is halfway between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows Bob is serious about getting a deal while remaining within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $11,250. This is still a great price for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,250, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Jhon's offer:**  $12,000, which is Bob's maximum budget. 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still not a good deal. Jhon's offer is still a viable option, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice in hopes of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $11,250 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us to find common ground. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's strategy:**  Continue to inch closer to Alice's offer, but keep the counteroffer below her previous price.
* **Counteroffer justification:**  $11,000 is a significant jump from Bob's previous offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate. It's also below Alice's previous counteroffer, leaving room for further negotiation. This puts the pressure on Alice to make a decision."
