"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm ready to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price considering we're both trying to find a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $11,250. This is still a great price for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $11,250 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us to find common ground. Let's work together to make this happen.",11000.0,Bob,6,
