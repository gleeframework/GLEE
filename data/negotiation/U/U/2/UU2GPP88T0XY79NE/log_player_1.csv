Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Let's meet halfway â€“ how about $20,000?  I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $19,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While $19,000 is less than our initial target, it's a strong offer. Accepting now guarantees a profit above our minimum ($15,000) and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or the negotiation reaching an impasse."
