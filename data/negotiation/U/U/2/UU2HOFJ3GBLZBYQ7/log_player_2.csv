"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is likely much higher. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
