"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is likely much higher. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $900000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while staying within my financial limits.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $825000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am still looking to keep the price within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. This price aligns closely with the value I see in the product and is within my financial capacity.",800000.0,Bob,4,
