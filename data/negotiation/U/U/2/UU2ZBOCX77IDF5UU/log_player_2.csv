"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other buyers.  I believe its value is significant, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000. What are your thoughts on this? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's tempting to get the product first,  Alice's price is too high. Bob can get the same product from John for a lower price, saving himself $300,000."
