"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a fantastic deal for you, Bob! I'm willing to let you have this amazing product for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** You value the product at $150 and Alice is offering it for $120, which is a significant saving.
* **You don't need to haggle further:** You've already saved $30, and further negotiation might not be worth the effort."
