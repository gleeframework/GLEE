Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,100,000 is more than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's also less than your minimum price. 
* **It allows for negotiation:**  By starting slightly above Bob's perceived value, there's room for negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **It's a strong opening:**  It demonstrates that you're confident in the value of your product while also being open to discussion. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response. You can also use your knowledge of John's offer to influence your negotiation strategy. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While you could accept this and get something, it's not in your best interest.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your minimum acceptable value.  You can use John's offer of $1,200,000 as leverage in your negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:** $1,050,000 is a midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows you're willing to negotiate, but still not willing to drop below your minimum acceptable value.
* **Highlight the value:**  By reminding Bob of the product's value, you reinforce the fact that even this counteroffer is a good deal for him.
* **Keep the door open:** The message remains positive and encourages further negotiation. You want to keep Bob engaged and avoid a stalemate. 

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's closer than his initial offer, it's not worth the risk of losing a potential sale to John for a significantly higher price. You can still make a counteroffer to try and push for a better price, but you should also consider the potential time investment in negotiating with Bob.  It might be more strategic to just sell to John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference and agree on $1,012,500? It's a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired amount. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1012500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This approach is a common negotiation tactic and often signals a willingness to compromise.  
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** The message remains polite and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Focusing on the benefits:** The counteroffer highlights the price as ""great"" for Bob, making it more appealing.

This counteroffer provides a more balanced approach. It shows you're willing to negotiate but not willing to accept a price that is too far below your minimum. Now it's up to Bob to decide."
