"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While it's closer to what I'm looking for,  $950000 is still a bit lower than what I believe this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $975000, but I'm not sure I can go lower than that. What are your thoughts?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to propose a price of $960000 for the product. This price is a fair compromise, allowing us to move forward with a transaction while respecting the value you place on your product.",960000.0,Bob,4,
