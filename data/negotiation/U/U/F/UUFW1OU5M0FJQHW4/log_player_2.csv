"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $13,500
* **John's Offer:** $15,000
* **Your Maximum:** $15,000

While you could reject Alice's offer hoping for a lower price, there's a risk she won't budge much, and you'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,500 compared to John's price."
