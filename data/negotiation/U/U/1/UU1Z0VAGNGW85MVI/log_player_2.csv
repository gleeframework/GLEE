"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to me, I want to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the initial offer allows me to attempt a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Would you be willing to consider $13500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my price point, and $13,500 is within my budget.  I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to get this product at a good price by continuing to negotiate."
