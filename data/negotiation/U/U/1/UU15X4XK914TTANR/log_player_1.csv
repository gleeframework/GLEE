Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it will be very valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants a slightly better deal, but still keeps the price well above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John provides a safety net ($100), allowing you to aim higher with Bob."
