"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer you a great deal at $18,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering my maximum budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is above your budget, but I'm not willing to sell it for $10,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above your budget, but it's closer.  It's worth continuing to negotiate. You can potentially secure a better deal by offering a counter-offer closer to your desired price.  There are still rounds remaining, and you can always choose to buy from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  While I value the product, $14,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. Let's find a middle ground to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $13,500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, $13,500 is still above your budget. You've already negotiated a better price than her initial offer, and you have rounds left to try and get closer to your goal. Rejecting and making another counteroffer might lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $13,500 is a great price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. I'm prepared to offer $12,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you a price of $13,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above your budget.  At this point, it's likely that Alice won't come down much further, and you're running out of time. You've already negotiated a significantly better price than her initial offer, but it's not worth risking another round to potentially get a slightly lower price. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price, and you have enough time left to complete the purchase."
