"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering my maximum budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is above your budget, but I'm not willing to sell it for $10,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  While I value the product, $14,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. Let's find a middle ground to make this deal work.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $13,500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $13,500 is a great price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. I'm prepared to offer $12,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can seal the deal!",12500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you a price of $13,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",13000.0,Alice,7,
