# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product,  $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering its worth to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
