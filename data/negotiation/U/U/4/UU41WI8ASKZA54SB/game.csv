"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think!",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $125. I understand it's a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $155, which is still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think!",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $155 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $140, which would be fair to both of us.  Let's make a deal!",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $147.50. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for you. Let me know what you think!",147.5,Alice,5,
