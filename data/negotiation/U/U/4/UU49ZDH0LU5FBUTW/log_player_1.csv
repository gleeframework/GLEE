Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This allows me to gauge his interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe the product is worth more than $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  This counteroffer gives Bob some room to bargain while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's likely we'll just go back and forth without reaching an agreement.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures I get my minimum desired value and avoid further negotiation."
