Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to maximize her profit. Knowing Bob's valuation is lower than John's, she aims for a price closer to her own valuation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price, still exceeding his valuation of $800,000. 
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly and accept a higher price.
* **John as a Safety Net:** John's guaranteed purchase at Alice's minimum acceptable price provides a safety net, ensuring she doesn't settle for less than she values the product."
