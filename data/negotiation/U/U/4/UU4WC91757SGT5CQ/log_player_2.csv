# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Bob should reject the offer.  While $11,500 is less than what John is asking, Bob can likely do better.  He'll counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $10,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $11,000?  It's a fair price for a product that you'll find extremely valuable. Let's see if we can close this deal!
