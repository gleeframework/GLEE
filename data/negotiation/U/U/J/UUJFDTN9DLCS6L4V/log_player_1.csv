"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but not so high that it seems unreasonable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to start the negotiation.

**Important Note:** While I have a floor of $1,500,000, starting too low might make Bob think he can get a much better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value is closer to $1,000,000. I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While it's closer to my floor price, it's still below the $1,500,000 I'm comfortable with. 
* **I have time and leverage:**  I have 8 rounds left to negotiate and I know John is willing to pay my minimum. This gives me leverage to push for a higher price.
* **Counteroffering shows commitment:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and sending a counteroffer demonstrates that I'm serious about closing the deal, but also that I'm not willing to settle for a low price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's continue working towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm reiterating my commitment to finding a deal.
* **Focusing on value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Creating urgency:**  By suggesting a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm subtly implying that we should close the deal soon."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my floor price of $1,500,000.
* **Still below my minimum:** However, it's still below my minimum, and I'm not willing to settle for less.
* **Time is on my side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to see if Bob will raise his offer. 
* **John is a backup:**  I know I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, which gives me leverage.

**Counteroffering Strategy:** I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my minimum. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell."
