"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up on the extra $200. I'll meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $13400. This is my last offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",13400.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already met you halfway twice and I'm not willing to go any further. I'll offer it to you for $13250, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",13250.0,Alice,9,
