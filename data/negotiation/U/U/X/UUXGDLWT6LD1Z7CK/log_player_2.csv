"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $600,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's a lot of room for negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower to see how much she's willing to move on the price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $600,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $400,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me."", ""product_price"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $400,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $550,000. This is a compromise that I think is still a great value for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000

While $550,000 is better, I think there's still room to negotiate. I'll counteroffer closer to her price, but still leaving room for me to potentially get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $475,000? That's a significant step up from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 475000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $475,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $525,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $525,000

Alice is clearly holding firm, and $525,000 is a substantial savings compared to John's offer. It's time to take the deal."
