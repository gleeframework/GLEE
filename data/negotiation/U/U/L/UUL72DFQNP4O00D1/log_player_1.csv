Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $11,500 gives Bob a significant discount ($500) compared to its value to him ($10,000), making it an attractive offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is my initial offer, there's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate further, potentially still landing me a better price than John's offer."
