Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value is there, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $700,000? That's a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my seriousness about purchasing. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still far below my minimum.  I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $900,000."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.

**Reasoning:**  We are past the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. While Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, it's still significantly less than my target and what John is offering.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a price closer to my minimum."
