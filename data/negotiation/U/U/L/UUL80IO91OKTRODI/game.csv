"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,000,000. This reflects the value I believe you'll gain from this product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value is there, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $700,000? That's a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my seriousness about purchasing.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, $700,000 is a substantial investment.  Let's meet halfway - I can offer the product for $950,000. I believe this recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, to be completely transparent, I have another buyer who's prepared to offer $1,200,000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need a price that reflects the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 as my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,7,
