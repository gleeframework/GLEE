Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $20,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to spend $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  That's a significant jump from my initial offer and should be fair to both of us.
