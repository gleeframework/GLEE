"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects the true value of this product. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $20,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to spend $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment at that price.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  That's a significant jump from my initial offer and should be fair to both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
