"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is way above my maximum budget of $8,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to my maximum budget while still leaving room for negotiation. $8,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering my willingness to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be very happy with it.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  Let's try $9,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $9,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. It's a good compromise that might be more appealing to Alice than my previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 might be a stretch, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

This is a good compromise that reflects both the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $9,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to meet her halfway. It's a good compromise that may be more appealing to Alice than my previous offer. With only 4 rounds left, I need to find a price point that is acceptable to both of us."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $10,250 is closer to my budget, I'm still going to have to stick to my offer of $9,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement in the next two rounds."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my previous offer of $9,500. I've shown Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to negotiate.  With only two rounds left, I need to show Alice that I'm not willing to go any higher and see if she will accept my offer.  If not, I will consider purchasing from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $9,500, but I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $10,000 is still higher than my budget. While she is showing a willingness to negotiate, we are stuck at an impasse. With only one round remaining, the chances of her accepting a lower price are slim. It's better to take the sure thing and purchase the product from John for $8,000. This ensures I get the product at my desired price and avoids risking further negotiation with Alice."
