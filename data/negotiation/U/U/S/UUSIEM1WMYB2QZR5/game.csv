"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $85. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $90.  Let's see if we can make this work.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to consider $92.50. It's a fair price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get the product.",92.5,Alice,5,
