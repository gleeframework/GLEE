"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
