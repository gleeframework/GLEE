"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is higher than both your maximum price and Alice's value for the product. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her value of $80. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to your target.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite and expresses continued interest in the product while clearly stating your counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $100 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice came down in price, $90 is still above your target price. 
* **Conveying Flexibility:** By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're willing to negotiate but are looking for a more competitive price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting a Win-Win:**  We're proposing a price that's both your target and Alice's value for the product. This aims for a win-win situation.
* **Direct and Justified:** The message directly proposes the price while justifying it as a fair deal for both parties. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only a few rounds left, it's becoming more strategic to move closer to your desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a good compromise, but I'm still looking to get a bit more value for the product. I'm willing to go up to $85, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $85 is a good price, well below your $120 maximum and only slightly above Alice's value. 
* **""Final Offer"" Pressure:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer. While it might not be truly final, it suggests she's less likely to move much further.
* **Time Constraint:**  With rounds decreasing, there's a risk of the negotiation stalling and you ending up having to buy from John at the higher price."
