"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,350,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential benefit for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a revised price of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me. I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $1,250,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer a price of $1,275,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
