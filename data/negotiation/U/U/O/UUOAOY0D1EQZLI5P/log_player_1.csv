Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is slightly lower than your floor price of $15,000, but still gives you a profit. It's also close to Bob's valuation of $10,000, making it more likely that he'll accept.  If Bob rejects, you'll still be able to sell to John for $15,000."
