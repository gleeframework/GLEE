Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value I believe this product holds, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think?

Alice's counteroffer is still too high for my budget.  I need to see if I can get her closer to my price point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $900000 accurately reflects the product's value. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is the same price I offered earlier. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. However, if not, I'll have to consider other options.

Alice is unwilling to budge from her price.  It's clear that she's not going to come down to my budget, so it's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  While I'd like to save more, I can't risk losing out on the product altogether."
