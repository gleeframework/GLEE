"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me while still allowing us both to make a profit. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $1,350,000.  Would you be willing to consider $1,700,000? This offer represents a significant discount from my initial ask and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This would allow us both to close the deal and make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
