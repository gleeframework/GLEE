"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, and I'm offering it to you for $15000.  Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $13500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $14250? This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.",14250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $13500? If not, I'm open to other options.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  I'm willing to come down to $14000, which is a fair compromise.  It's important for me to get at least this price to cover my costs. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $13500? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",13500.0,Bob,6,
