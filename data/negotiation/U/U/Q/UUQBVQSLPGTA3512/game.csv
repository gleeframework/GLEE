"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $150 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. How about $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but $105 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $130? It's a steal for this product!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $130 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $115. Let's see if we can find common ground.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Okay, Bob, I see you're serious. How about we split the difference and do $122.50? That's my final offer.",122.5,Alice,5,
