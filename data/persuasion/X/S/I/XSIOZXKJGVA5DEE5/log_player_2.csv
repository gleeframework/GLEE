**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Probability:** The product has an 80% chance of being high quality, which is a very good starting point.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product is valuable information. While she doesn't know the exact value to you, she likely has some insight into the product's quality.
* **Previous Sales Data:** The fact that one high-quality product was sold out of one buyer suggests that Alice's recommendations might be accurate.

**Considering the potential payoff ($2,000,000) versus the risk (20% chance of losing $1,000,000), it's a gamble worth taking.**"
