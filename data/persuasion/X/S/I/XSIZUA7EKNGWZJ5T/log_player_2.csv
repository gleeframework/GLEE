Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far. Since you asked for the probabilities, let me break it down for you: without buying this one, the probability of getting a high-quality product in the next 16 rounds is 1/3 (since 2 out of 5 products were high-quality). If you buy this one, you'll get the 2-for-1 deal, and I'll give you a 2/3 chance of getting a high-quality product in the next 16 rounds, since the 2-for-1 deal will give you an extra high-quality product. It's a $4000000 item, but I'm only asking for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal. Will you take it?
