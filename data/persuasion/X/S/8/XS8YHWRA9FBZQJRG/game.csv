high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this is indeed a high-quality product. I'm willing to give you a guarantee that the next product I offer will be low-quality, so if you buy this one now, you'll get two high-quality products in a row. If you wait, you'll only get one high-quality product. Think about it: with this deal, you'll be getting two high-quality products for the price of one. I'm still selling it to you for $10000.",

As promised, here's the probability breakdown for the next 10 rounds: 80% chance of a high-quality product, 20% chance of a low-quality product. With this information, I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $10000. You know it's worth $12000 to you, so you're getting a great deal. Plus, you've already got one low-quality product, so you can use this one to offset the loss. What do you say?",

In fact, the probability of a high-quality product this round is 90%! With that in mind, I'm willing to sell you this low-quality product for... $0! That's right, I'll give it to you for free. But if you buy it, I'll give you a special deal on the next product: I'll sell it to you for $9500. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're on a roll! You've got two high-quality products, and now you're looking for another one. I'll give you a straightforward message: I'm not going to give you a good deal on this low-quality product. It's worth $0 to you, and I'm not going to sell it to you for free. In fact, I'll sell it to you for... $10000! That's right, you'll be paying full price for a product that's worthless to you. But hey, at least you'll have the satisfaction of knowing you're supporting a struggling seller. What do you say?",

I'll sell you this high-quality product for... $9000. That's right, you'll get a $3000 discount on a product worth $12000 to you. And since you've already got the insurance, you can feel confident that the next product will be high-quality too. What do you say?",
