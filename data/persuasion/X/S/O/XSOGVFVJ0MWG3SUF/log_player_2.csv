I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, which has a 50% chance of being high-quality and 50% chance of being low-quality. I've sold 1 product so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk of selling this product to you for $1000000. Will you take the chance?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: Welcome to my store! I'm glad to have you here. I've sold 3 products now, and 2 of them were high-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you about the latest product. After careful consideration, I've determined that this product is not of high-quality. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000, the same price as the previous products.
