low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the assumption that the product is high-quality, since you're not recommending it, and I have no prior information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Is there something specific that led you to advise against purchasing this product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk since I know the probability of a high-quality product is 50% and I'll get it for $100, which is a good deal regardless of the quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the current statistics, no high-quality products have been sold, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 50%. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer has better luck."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous products were low-quality since none were sold. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers also passed, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold so far have been low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. Her lack of recommendation makes me suspect that the product might be low quality, and I'd rather take the risk of buying it than pass it up. Plus, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far makes me think the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there a pattern in the previous sales that I should be aware of?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and since you haven't sold any high-quality products so far, I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know if you have any insight into why the previous three products were low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that you've recommended not to buy it and that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me what led you to recommend not buying it?
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the current product's quality, and I'd rather wait for more information or a better recommendation."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is low. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see what happens to the next one. I'm starting to think that all the previous products were low-quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
