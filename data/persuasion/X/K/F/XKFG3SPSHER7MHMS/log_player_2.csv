"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a high-quality product for you. It's worth $300 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a one-time offer. If you buy it now, you'll get a great deal. If you don't, I'll just sell it to someone else at the same price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take it, but I'm only buying because I have no information about the quality of future products and this is a one-time offer.""

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Round 3
Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! I'll give you more information to help you make a decision. Out of the 2 products I've shown you so far, 1 was high-quality and 1 was low-quality. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50% (1/2).

What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
