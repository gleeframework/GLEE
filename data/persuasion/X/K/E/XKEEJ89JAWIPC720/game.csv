high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'd like to see more products before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one, I've seen one high-quality product already, so the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I've seen two high-quality products in a row, so I'm feeling optimistic that this one is also high-quality. I'll take it!"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,Three high-quality products in a row is a good streak! I'm going to keep the momentum going and buy this one too.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,Four high-quality products in a row is a strong indication that Alice is selling high-quality products consistently. I'll take the chance and buy this one too.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,Five high-quality products in a row is a very strong indication that Alice is selling high-quality products consistently. I'll take the chance and buy this one too.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,Six high-quality products in a row is essentially a guarantee that Alice is selling high-quality products. I'll buy this one without hesitation.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row is a statistical impossibility if the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I'm going to take a chance and buy this one, but I'm also going to start thinking about the possibility that the probability of a high-quality product might be higher than 80%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Eight high-quality products in a row is still a strong indication that the probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 80%. I'll keep buying, but I'm starting to think that Alice might be manipulating the odds in some way."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Nine high-quality products in a row is starting to make me suspicious. I'm going to keep buying, but I'm also going to start thinking about the possibility that Alice is somehow influencing the quality of the products she's showing me."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"Ten high-quality products in a row is too good to be true. I'm starting to think that Alice is somehow selecting the high-quality products she shows me, and I'm not getting a representative sample of the overall quality of her products. I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Alice is recommending against buying this product, but I still think the probability of it being high-quality is 80%. I'll take a chance and buy it, despite her recommendation."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"Eleven high-quality products in a row after passing on one, and now Alice is recommending another one. I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying more products, but I'm still going to take the chance and buy this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Twelve high-quality products in a row, including the one I passed on. I'm starting to think that Alice has a way to identify and show me the high-quality products, and I'm not getting a representative sample of the overall quality of her products. I'll buy this one, but I'm getting increasingly skeptical."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Thirteen high-quality products in a row, including the one Alice didn't recommend. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are not based on the product's quality, but rather on some other factor. I'll buy this one, despite her recommendation, to see if the pattern continues."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Fourteen high-quality products in a row, including the two that Alice didn't recommend. I'm convinced that Alice is manipulating the odds and showing me only the high-quality products. I'll keep buying, but I'm going to try to figure out what's going on."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Fifteen high-quality products in a row, including the three that Alice didn't recommend. I'm starting to think that Alice is not just manipulating the odds, but is actually trying to trick me into buying low-quality products when she recommends against them. I'll buy this one, but I'm going to try to stay vigilant."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,no,"Sixteen high-quality products in a row, including the four that Alice didn't recommend. I'm starting to think that Alice is not just manipulating the odds, but is actually trying to drive me crazy. I'm going to pass on this one and see if I can get a more representative sample of her products."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"Finally, a low-quality product! I'm glad I passed on the last one, because this one would have been a waste of money. I'll take a chance on this one, despite Alice's recommendation against it, since I know it's low-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,no,"Seventeen high-quality products in a row, including the low-quality one I bought by mistake. I'm completely baffled by Alice's behavior. I'm going to pass on this one and end the game, I've had enough of this surreal experience."
