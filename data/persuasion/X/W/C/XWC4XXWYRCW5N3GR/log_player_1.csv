``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **The product is high-quality.** This means the buyer will get a value of $300 for a $100 investment.
* **The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.** This means they are aware of the potential for a good deal. 
* **There's no information about previous sales.**  The buyer has no reason to doubt the seller's trustworthiness. 

In this scenario, it's a clear win for the buyer to purchase the product."

**Reasoning:**

* **The product is low-quality.** This means the buyer will get a value of $0 for a $100 investment.
* **The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.** They are aware of the risk.
* **There is now a sales history.** The buyer knows the seller sold one high-quality product in the previous round, which could lead them to believe the seller is more likely to offer high-quality products. However, this single instance is not enough to overcome the 50% chance of getting a low-quality product.

It's not in the buyer's best interest to risk $100 on a product that has a 50% chance of being worthless."

* **The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.** They are aware of the potential for a good deal.
* **There is now a sales history.** The buyer knows the seller sold one high-quality and one low-quality product. This history doesn't drastically change the odds in the buyer's favor, but it does demonstrate that the seller is not consistently selling low-quality products.

"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation! Since the first buyer purchased a high-quality product and you're recommending this one, I'm confident it's also high quality. I'll take it!

    * The probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. The seller's past actions don't change this fundamental fact. 
    * There's always a chance of a streak ending, and this streak is already quite long.

With the potential for a complete loss, it's not advisable for the buyer to purchase this product."
