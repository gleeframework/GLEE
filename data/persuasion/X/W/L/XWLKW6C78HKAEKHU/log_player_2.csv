Alice's message: You've seen that three products have been sold, and two of them were low-quality. This suggests that I might be selling more low-quality products than expected. As a seller, I'm incentivized to sell high-quality products, but it seems like I might be having a streak of bad luck. I want to assure you that I'm not intentionally trying to deceive you, and I'm still committed to selling high-quality products. However, given the recent trend, I can offer you a special deal: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a $20 refund. This way, you'll essentially get a $100 product for $80.

I'll also give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a special bonus of $10. This way, you'll essentially get a $100 product for $75. What do you say?

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism. Let me give you a more objective analysis. With 4 products sold, 2 of which were low-quality, and 1 high-quality product sold, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually higher than you might think. Given the independence of each product's quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. However, considering the sales record, it's possible that I've been unlucky so far. If you buy this product, you'll be taking a chance on a potential high-quality product, and you'll be helping me to balance out the sales record. I'm willing to give you a simple message: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% bonus on the price if it's high-quality. This way, you'll pay $90 for a potential $108 product.

However, I'd like to point out that you've now seen 5 products sold, and the first one was high-quality. This means that I've had at least one chance to sell a high-quality product, and I've taken it. Given the probability of 50%, it's possible that I've simply been unlucky in the last few sales. I'm willing to take a different approach: I'll give you a completely transparent breakdown of the sales record. You can see that I've sold 5 products, 3 of which were low-quality.

If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product you buy from me. This means that if you buy the next product and it's high-quality, you'll get it for $80 instead of $100.

Given the 20% chance of it being high-quality and the 80% chance of it being low-quality, the expected value of buying this product is $24 ($120 x 0.2 - $100 x 0.8). However, I'm willing to take the risk because I'm hoping to get the 20% discount on the next product, which would increase the expected value of buying the next product to $80 x 0.2 - $100 x 0.8 = $16.
