Plus, I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, so the chances are low that this one is high-quality. Trust me, you won't find a better deal anywhere else!",
,,the buyer,1,"I appreciate the offer, but given the lack of data and the fact that you've mentioned selling no high-quality products yet, I think it's best to take a cautious approach.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're a savvy buyer, I like that! You're right to be cautious. But let me put things into perspective. I've sold 1 product so far, and it was a low-quality one. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually higher than you think. In fact, since I have a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product each time, the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 50%! And I'm willing to sell this one to you for the same price of $10000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better one elsewhere.",
