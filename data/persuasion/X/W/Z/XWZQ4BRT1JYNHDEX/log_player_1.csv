"The buyer's message: I'll take your recommendation into account, but I'll still make my own decision. Since 11 out of 13 buyers purchased the product, I'll assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is around 85% (11/13). Given this probability, I'll calculate the expected value of the product. If I buy the product and it's high-quality, I'll get $4000000, and if it's low-quality, I'll get $0. The expected value is (0.85 * $4000000) + (0.15 * $0) = $3400000. Since this is greater than the price of $1000000, I'll decide to buy the product.
