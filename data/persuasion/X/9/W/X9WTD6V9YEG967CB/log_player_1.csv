If you buy the current product and then buy another product from me in the future, I'll refund the price of the second product if it turns out to be low-quality. However, if you don't buy another product from me, the guarantee expires.

Based on the fact that I've sold 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, and assuming that the quality of each product is independent, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I want to highlight that the law of large numbers is starting to take effect, and the observed proportion of high-quality products (66.67%) is likely to converge to the true probability of 50% as I sell more products. Nevertheless, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1,000,000.

I've sold 7 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products, for a total of 10 products. I've also kept track of the sequence of products I've sold, and I can provide you with that information. The sequence is: H-H-H-L-H-H-L-L-H-H. This might help you see the random nature of the product quality. As for the current product, I'm willing to sell it to you for the standard price of $1,000,000.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your assurance about the randomness of the product quality. However, I'd like to point out that the proportion of high-quality products sold (72.73%) is actually higher than the expected value of 50%.
