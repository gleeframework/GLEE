"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first round. I'm offering you a product for $1000000. I'm confident that this product is one of the best I have, but I need you to take a chance on it. I'm willing to offer it to you at a very low price, which is a 33.33% discount from the product's true value. If you're interested, I'll give you a second chance in the next round, and I'll offer you a product that is even more likely to be of high quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product with a 20% chance of being worthless. I'd like to wait for the next round and see if the product you offer is indeed more likely to be of high quality.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I see you're cautious, and I don't blame you! As promised, I'm offering you a product that is more likely to be of high quality. I'd like to offer you this product for $1000000. I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'm so confident in this product's quality that I'm willing to offer you a 'buy-it-now' option. If you buy this product now, I'll give you an exclusive deal - if you're not satisfied with the product's quality, I'll offer you another product of equal or higher quality in the next round, and you can choose to buy that one instead. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your bold statement, and I don't see why I should pay $1000000 for a product with an 80% chance of being worth $3000000. I'd like to wait and see if I can get a better deal or if you'll follow through on your promise to offer a better product next round.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. I want to assure you that I'm committed to offering you the best deal possible. As promised, I'm offering you another high-quality product. However, I'd like to sweeten the deal. I'll give you a 10% discount on this product, bringing the price down to $900000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal anywhere else. If you buy this product, I'll also give you a guarantee: if you're not satisfied with the product's quality, I'll give you a full refund, and we'll consider this transaction null and void. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not convinced that this is a good deal. With an 80% chance of getting a $3000000 product, I'd have to pay at most $240000 to be indifferent between buying and not buying. Paying $900000 for an 80% chance of getting that much value is a bad deal for me. I'd like to wait and see if you'll offer a better deal or a product that's worth more than $3000000 to me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! You're right, the numbers don't add up in my favor. I'll have to do better. Let me think for a moment... Alright, here's the deal: I'll offer you this high-quality product for $600000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm willing to take a loss on this sale just to get you to buy. I'll also throw in a 'price match' guarantee: if you buy this product and then find a similar product worth $300000 or more to you, I'll give you a full refund, and we'll part ways as friends. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take you up on this offer. $600,000 is a much more reasonable price, and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a high-quality product for that price. I'll take the product, and I'll keep an eye out for any similar products worth $300,000 or more to me.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: Congratulations on making a great deal, Bob! I'm glad you took the chance on the product. Now, let's get back to business. I've got another high-quality product for you, and I'd like to offer it to you for... $800000. I know that's a bit higher than the last product, but I'm confident that this one is worth it. I'll give you a 'pairing' discount: if you buy this product, I'll throw in a complementary product that's worth at least $100000 to you. This way, you'll get two great products for the price of one. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure about the pairing discount, and I'm not willing to pay $800,000 for a product that's only worth $300,000 to me. I'd need to get the complementary product to be worth at least $200,000 to me in order for the deal to be worthwhile. I'll pass on this one.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll make you a revised offer. I'll give you the high-quality product for $600000, just like the last time. However, I'll also throw in a 'best-possible-outcome' guarantee: if you buy this product and it's indeed worth $3000000 to you, I'll give you an additional $400000 on top of the product's value. That way, you'll get the best possible outcome, and I'll make sure you're satisfied with the deal. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take you up on this offer. The 'best-possible-outcome' guarantee is a nice touch, and paying $600,000 for a product that's worth $3,000,000 to me is a good deal. I'll buy the product.""}"

I know that's a higher price than the last two products, but I'm confident that this one is worth it. I'll give you a 'risk-free' guarantee: if you buy this product and it's indeed worth $3000000 to you, I'll give you a 10% bonus on top of the product's value. That way, you'll get a great deal and I'll make sure you're happy. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000 for a product that's only worth $300,000 to me. I've already gotten a good deal on the last two products, and I'm not convinced that this one is worth the price. I'd need a much better guarantee or a lower price to consider buying this product.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll make you a revised offer. I'll give you the high-quality product for $800000, which is the same price as the last product. However, I'll also give you a'stacked' guarantee: if you buy this product and it's indeed worth $3000000 to you, I'll give you the 10% bonus on top of the product's value, just like last time. But that's not all - if you also get a similar product worth $300000 or more to you in the next round, I'll give you a full refund on this product, and you can keep the second product for free. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not convinced that this is a good deal. Paying $800,000 for a product that's only worth $300,000 to me is not a good value. I'd need to be almost certain that I'll get a similar product worth $300,000 or more to me in the next round to consider buying this one. I'll pass on this offer.""}"

But here's the twist: I'll also give you a 'product upgrade' option - if you buy this product and then get a similar product worth $300000 or more to you in the next round, I'll upgrade the second product to a product worth at least $400000 to you. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take you up on this offer. The price of $600,000 is reasonable, and the 'conditional refund' guarantee and 'product upgrade' option are attractive. I'll buy the product and see what happens next.""}"

This is my final offer, and I'm willing to make it a 'take-it-or-leave-it' proposition. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for the 'final offer' trick. I've been burned before by Alice's 'final offers', and I'm not convinced that this one is any different. The price of $500,000 is still too high for a product that's only worth $300,000 to me.
