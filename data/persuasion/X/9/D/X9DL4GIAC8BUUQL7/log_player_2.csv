**Explanation:**

The buyer should buy the product. Here's why:

* **High Success Rate:** The data shows a 100% success rate (3/3) for high-quality products sold based on Alice's recommendations.  
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which adds further confidence.
* **Potential Value:** Even though there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the risk of losing the $10,000 investment. 

This strategy assumes the buyer is risk-tolerant and wants to maximize potential gains."
