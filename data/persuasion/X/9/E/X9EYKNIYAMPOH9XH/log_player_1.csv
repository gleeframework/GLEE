This is the first time Alice has a high-quality product.

Alice should continue to recommend the product. Even though the buyer saw a low-quality product before, the buyer also saw a high-quality product that was purchased.

Although the buyer has seen a higher ratio of high-quality products to low-quality products, it's still too risky to recommend purchasing a low-quality product.  The buyer has no information about the actual quality of the current product.  Alice should continue to prioritize recommending against low-quality products until she can establish a better track record."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. While I appreciate your honesty, I'm going to pass on this product.  The statistics suggest a high proportion of high-quality products have been sold, but I'm hesitant to go against your recommendation without more information.
