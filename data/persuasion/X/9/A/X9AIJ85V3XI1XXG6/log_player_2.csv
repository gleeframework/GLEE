"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have no information about the product other than Alice's recommendation, and there's a 50% chance of it being high quality and worth $200, it's a gamble worth taking. Even if it turns out to be low quality, you only lose $100."

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice, knowing the true quality of the product, is advising against buying it. This strongly suggests the product is low quality. While there's a chance it could be high quality, the risk of losing $100 outweighs the potential gain of $100. It's better to pass."

```

**Reasoning:**

We're back to a similar situation as round 1.  Alice is recommending the product, and we have no additional information.  Since the odds are 50/50, it's worth taking the risk again.  We've already seen that Alice's recommendations can be accurate, and we could potentially double our money."
