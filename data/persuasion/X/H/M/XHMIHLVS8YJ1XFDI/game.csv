,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're cautious, and I appreciate your patience.

This product is a rare opportunity that won't come around again, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 66.67% discount from its true value.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you took advantage of the previous opportunity. Now, I'd like to offer you a chance to purchase another product. Since you've already bought one high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a'safety net' deal. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, you'll still have the high-quality product you already purchased, which is worth $3000000. Think of this as a 'get out of jail free' card.

I'll sell this product to you for $900000, which is a 70% discount from the original price. This is a chance to strengthen your portfolio and potentially maximize your returns.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not convinced by the consolidation deal. I already have two products, and I'm not willing to spend another $900000 on a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is like before making another decision.",no

You can use this low-quality product as a 'placeholder' and focus on waiting for a high-quality product in the next round. If you buy this product, you'll have a fresh start and a chance to reassess your strategy.",
