"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is not recommending the product, it's likely she knows it's low quality. Even though there's a chance it could be high quality, the odds are stacked against it. It's best to pass and avoid the risk of getting a worthless product."

**Explanation:**

```

**Explanation:**

The pattern continues. Alice's consistent lack of recommendation, coupled with the previous two rounds revealing low-quality products, reinforces the idea that the current product is also likely low-quality. It's statistically more likely to be a bad deal, so it's best to pass."

```

**Explanation:**

This is a significant shift! Alice has never recommended a product before, and now she is recommending this one. It is highly probable that this is a high-quality product, given her past behavior.  Since the potential reward ($20,000) is much higher than the risk ($10,000), it is worth taking the chance."

While the previous round saw a successful purchase, it's important to remember that Alice's recommendations are not guaranteed. The odds still favor low-quality products, and the previous round could have been a fluke.
