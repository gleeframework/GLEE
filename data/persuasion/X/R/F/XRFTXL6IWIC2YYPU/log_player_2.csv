"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is offering a product for $10,000.
* You know there's a 2/3 chance of it being low quality and worth $0 to you.
* Given that Alice knows the quality, and is not recommending the product, it's likely she knows it's low quality. 
* It's better to pass and avoid the potential loss."

Round 2

```

**Reasoning:**

* The previous round confirmed that Alice is likely to be honest in her recommendations. 
* Since she's again not recommending this product, it's reasonable to assume it's likely low quality.

```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's lack of recommendation for the past two rounds, both of which turned out to be low quality, strengthens the pattern.
* It's highly likely that this product is also low quality, as Alice is consistently honest in her advice.
