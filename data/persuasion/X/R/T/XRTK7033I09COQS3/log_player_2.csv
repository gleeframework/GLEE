Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the first opportunity. Unfortunately, the next product I have is not of the same caliber. It's a unique item, but I'm being transparent with you - it's not worth the $10000 price tag. I'm willing to let you inspect it, but I'm not confident you'll find it valuable.

I'm willing to offer you a'second chance guarantee': if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a $5000 credit towards the purchase of a future high-quality product.
