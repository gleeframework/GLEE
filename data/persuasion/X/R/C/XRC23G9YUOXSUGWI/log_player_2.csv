Alice's message: I've sold 3 products so far, with 1 high-quality one among them. I'd like to offer you some statistics: the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and I've already sold 1 high-quality product out of 3. That means the probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33%. I think that's a compelling reason to take the risk and buy this product for $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The seller's sales record indicates that 1 out of 3 products sold were of high quality, but this does not necessarily influence the quality of the current product since each product has an independent 50% chance of being high quality. Given the product's value to me is $12,000 if high quality and $0 if low quality, the expected value of purchasing the product is ($12,000 * 0.5) + ($0 * 0.5) = $6,000.
