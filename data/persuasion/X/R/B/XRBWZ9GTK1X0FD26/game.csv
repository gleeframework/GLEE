low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Hello! I appreciate your cautious approach. Today, we're offering a product with a lower probability of being high-quality, which is unfortunately 20% given the nature of this round. However, considering the current market conditions and the unique opportunity this presents, I encourage you to weigh the potential value against the risk. Remember, while the odds might not be in your favor, every sale offers a chance for discovery and potentially a pleasant surprise.",

I encourage you to trust the historical data and the integrity of our offerings. This high-quality product could be your chance to secure a valuable asset at a fair price.",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your encouragement, Alice, but I'm not convinced. With only one high-quality product sold out of two attempts, I'm not ready to trust the 80% probability just yet. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hello! I understand your skepticism and respect your desire for more data.

high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Hello! Thank you for your interest. I'm glad you're looking for more information to make an informed decision.

Today's high-quality product continues to present a great opportunity. I encourage you to consider the potential value and the favorable odds, and make a decision based on these insights.",
,,the buyer,9,"Thank you for the statistics, Alice. However, I'd like to clarify that the success rate is actually 80% based on the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold, not the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of buyers.

I encourage you to consider the potential value and the favorable odds, and make a decision based on your own analysis of the information available to you.",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your encouragement, Alice. However, I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Is it 100% (3/3), which would imply that you're only offering high-quality products, or is it 100% (3/3) because no one has passed on the product yet, and we don't have enough data to determine the true proportion?",yes

Making decisions based on the probability rather than past outcomes can sometimes lead to better long-term results.",
,,the buyer,15,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $100 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'd like to wait for the next product, hoping it will be of high quality.",no
