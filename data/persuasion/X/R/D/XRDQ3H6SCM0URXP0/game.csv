,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd rather wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and given the 66.67% chance of it being low quality, I'd like to pass on it for now. Maybe the next buyer will have more information to make a better decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it, so I'm doing it with some skepticism."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and the potential gain is $20000. I'm not sure what to make of Alice's recommendation, but I'll go against it and take a chance."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm suspicious that the products offered are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if I can get a better chance to buy a high-quality product later."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that she knows the quality of the products and might be recommending against high-quality products to avoid selling them."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the previous 3 buyers were likely given low-quality products, and the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%."

,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's not worth $20000 to me."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a different product recommendation."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy a high-quality product, it seems that Alice has been recommending low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
