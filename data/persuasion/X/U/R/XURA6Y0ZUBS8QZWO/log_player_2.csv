Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought, I suspect that all previous products were low quality. If all previous products were low quality, the probability of the current product being high quality would be 50%, which is the same as the prior probability. However, if all previous products were high quality, the probability of the current product being high quality would be 0. Given that I have no information about the quality of the previous products, I'll use Bayes' theorem to update the probability of the current product being high quality. Let's say P(H) is the probability of the current product being high quality, and P(L) is the probability of the current product being low quality. P(H) = (1/4) * 0.5 + (3/4) * 0.5 = 0.375. Therefore, I will pass on the product.""
