**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in my favor:** Even though there's a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, the fact that Alice recommends buying it *and* that the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product makes this a gamble worth taking. 
* **Limited Information:**  I don't have enough data to make a strong decision based purely on probabilities. The recommendation from Alice provides valuable information.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product at $125 is significant."
