,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it. Your recommendation is likely based on the fact that you don't know how much I value the product, but I'm willing to take the risk and buy it to get some information about its quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I want to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes after this sale, which might give me more information about the true quality of the products."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the current sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics. Can you tell me how many products were offered to the previous buyers and how many of them were high quality?
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of the first 2 products were not high-quality, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales rate and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'll take a chance on this product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the previous sales record shows no high-quality products were sold. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the overall statistics or the fact that all previous buyers have passed on the products?

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous buyers didn't buy the products and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, it suggests that the products Alice has offered so far are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the statistics change."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations, but I'm not sure if it's a high-quality one. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by your recommendation given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers were discouraged by Alice's recommendation, I suspect that Alice is recommending low-quality products to discourage buyers.
