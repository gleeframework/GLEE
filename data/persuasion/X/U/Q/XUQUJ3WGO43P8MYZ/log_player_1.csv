Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 
 
This is a tricky situation.  Here's why I recommend buying:

* **Value:**  A high-quality product is worth $125 to Bob, and it's only being sold for $100. This is a good deal.
* **Previous Rounds:**  While Bob didn't buy in the previous rounds, that doesn't necessarily mean the product is always bad.  Alice might have been trying different messaging strategies.  

It's a calculated risk, but the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality one.  It's best to be optimistic and take advantage of the potential opportunity."
