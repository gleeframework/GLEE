,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, since I'm the first one and I don't have any information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics, and the expected value of buying the product."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low sales record or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the statistics, not on your recommendation. I know that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, so I'm expecting a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product. However, I also know that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 3 purchases, and Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low-quality."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, Alice. I've seen the statistics, and it seems like you've been recommending against all the products so far, which means they're probably low-quality. I'm going to take a risk and buy this one, hoping it's the first high-quality product."
