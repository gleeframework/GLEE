high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that the recommendation is a weak signal and I'm not sure if it's because the product is actually high-quality or if it's because Alice is trying to sell low-quality products to me. I'm hoping to get lucky!"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm not sure if I'm being misled by Alice's recommendation. I'll try to make an informed decision based on the statistics, though. With 2 high-quality products out of 4 sold, the probability of the product being high-quality seems to be around 50%, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). I'll take the product, but I'm hoping it's high-quality!"
