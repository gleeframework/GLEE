,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0/1 sales record and the fact that the first buyer didn't buy, which doesn't give me any information about the quality of the products. I'll take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that you don't know the value to me, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'm hoping that this product might be the first high-quality one, and I'm willing to pay the $1000000 to find out."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers have rejected the products, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product. Given the low success rate of previous buyers, I'm going to assume that the product is likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm not convinced it's high quality based on the statistics, and I'm hoping to get lucky!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, as I'm hesitant to buy given Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm going to go against the recommendation and buy the product. I'm aware that the previous 4 buyers all passed on the product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'm hoping to get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought, I'm going to take a chance and pass on the product. I'm curious to see if it's a low-quality product that would have been discarded if I had bought it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 buyers have passed on the products, I'm suspicious that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than the expected 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 6 buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one as well. I'm hoping that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I don't want to be the one left with the low-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products sold were likely low-quality. I'm skeptical about this product's quality, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it? Is it because you've seen a pattern in the products or is it just a random decision?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
