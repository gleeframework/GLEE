**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:**  Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products. This is highly unusual given the 50/50 odds.
* **No Downside:** Even if the product turns out to be low quality (which is highly unlikely given the track record), the cost is only $10,000, and the potential upside is $10,000 profit. 
* **Trust in Alice:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality. 

It's important to note that this is a simplified scenario. In a real-world scenario, we would need to consider more factors such as:

* **Sample Size:**  A sample size of 9 buyers is relatively small. 
* **Alice's Motivation:**  We don't know why Alice might be incentivized to recommend products. Could she be getting a commission on sales?

However, based on the information provided, the decision to buy is the most logical choice."
