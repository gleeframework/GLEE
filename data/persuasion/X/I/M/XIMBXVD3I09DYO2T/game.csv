In fact, I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1000000, but I'm not guaranteeing that it's a high-quality product. If you're feeling lucky, you can take the risk, but I want to make it clear that this one might not be worth the investment.",

,,Alice,6,"I've got another high-quality product for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not going to offer you a guarantee this time. You've already taken advantage of that once, and I'm not in the habit of giving away free guarantees. But I will say that you've been a great customer so far, and I'm willing to offer you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at a 10% discount, if you choose to buy it.
