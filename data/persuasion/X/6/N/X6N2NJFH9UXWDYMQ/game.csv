,,Alice,4,no,

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low quality. Can you share the probability of the product being high quality?"

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'll buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer, and I want to take advantage of the information that 7 out of 7 previous buyers passed on the product. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to get a potential $30000 value."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low recommendation rate from previous buyers and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 8 out of 8 products sold so far were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and don't want to risk buying a low-quality one for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. I'd rather wait for a product that has not been recommended by Alice, or consider buying a product that has been recommended by her in the past if the proportion of high-quality products sold is higher."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 8 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely lower than 33.33%. I'll take a chance and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'll pass on it. I'm curious about your thought process behind this recommendation."
