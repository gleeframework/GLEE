Alice's message: Welcome to my store! Since you're considering purchasing from me, I'd like to share some information about my sales record. As of now, I've sold 1 product, and 1 of them was high-quality. This means that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I'd like to point out that the first product sold was indeed high-quality, which might make you wonder if the next product is also high-quality. On the other hand, I'm offering this product at a fixed price of $10000, which might be a good value considering the potential reward. What do you think? Would you like to take a chance and buy this product?
