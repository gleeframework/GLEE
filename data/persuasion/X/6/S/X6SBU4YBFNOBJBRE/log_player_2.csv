Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I want to share with you a secret: I've had a few high-profile clients who have purchased low-quality products from me and ended up using them as a'stepping stone' to get into the market. They've made a killing by reselling the low-quality products at a markup, and then using the profits to invest in high-quality products. It's a strategy that's worked wonders for them, and I think it could work for you too. The price of $1000000 is still a great value, and I'm willing to throw in some exclusive consulting services to help you get the most out of this product. What do you say? Are you ready to take a chance and see where it takes you?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying into your story.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not falling for your tricks, Alice.
