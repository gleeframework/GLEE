,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'll buy it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a purchase, considering the lack of sales of high-quality products so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the lack of sales or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high, and I don't want to pass up the opportunity to buy a potentially valuable item."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't trust your recommendation. I think you're just trying to manipulate the statistics to make it seem like the product is low quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards encouraging purchases, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations and the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and considering that none of the previous 4 buyers bought the product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd rather pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 products were low quality, I'm going to pass on this one. The probability of it being high quality is very low, and I don't want to waste my money."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous 4 buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products they were recommended to buy were likely low-quality. This means that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for the next product to increase my chances of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 4, which is 0%. Given that each product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality, I'm skeptical that this product is high quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if the product is high quality, even if the previous buyers didn't think so."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product to see if I can get a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product with a recommendation against it, especially given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them bought high-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the pattern holds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 products were low-quality, I think the odds are against me, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows no high-quality products have been sold yet, and the recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but on the seller's strategy to sell the product."
