**Explanation:**

This is a classic case of the ""lemons problem.""  Since there's no information about the product's quality besides Alice's recommendation, and the product is worth a lot if it's good and nothing if it's bad, it makes sense to buy it.  

Here's why:

* **Potential Gain:**  If the product is high quality, you stand to make a huge profit ($4,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $3,000,000).
* **Potential Loss:**  If the product is low quality, you lose your $1,000,000.

**The 50/50 odds are balanced out by the potential gain outweighing the potential loss.** 

While there's no guarantee of a good product, in this scenario, the risk is worth the potential reward."

**Reasoning:**

* **Historical Data:** 7 out of 7 products sold were high-quality. This is a perfect track record, suggesting Alice is consistently recommending high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice is recommending the product, which further reinforces the possibility of it being high-quality.
* **Risk vs Reward:**  While there's still a 50% chance of the product being low-quality, the potential reward ($4,000,000) significantly outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000.

**It's important to note:**  This decision relies heavily on the assumption that Alice is acting in good faith and providing accurate recommendations. In reality, there's always a chance of deception or manipulation."
