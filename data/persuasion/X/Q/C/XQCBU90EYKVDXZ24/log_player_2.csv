Alice's message: I appreciate your diligence in asking questions. The new supplier I mentioned had some issues with inconsistent quality control, which led to the low-quality products I sold earlier.

My original supplier has a 33.33% chance of selling a high-quality product, just like before.

However, I can tell you that the probability of selling 2 high-quality products in a row is around 11.11%, and the probability of selling 3 high-quality products in a row is around 3.70%.
