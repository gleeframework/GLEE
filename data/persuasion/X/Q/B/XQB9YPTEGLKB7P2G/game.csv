low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low quality, which suggests that your recommendations are not very reliable. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I will pass on this product and wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice doesn't recommend it. Given that 3 previous buyers have also passed on the product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and will pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as you've already recommended against it. I'd like to know the quality of the product and the probability of it being high quality, considering the statistics so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think you're just trying to scare me off with your recommendation. I'm going to ignore your advice and make my own decision based on the statistics."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it? Is it because of the statistics, or do you have some other information?"

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you haven't recommended it, which makes me think it's more likely to be low-quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I think it's likely that the products are mostly low quality."
