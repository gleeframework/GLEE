high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product and wait for more information before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. If 3 out of 3 buyers have bought the product, and only 1 out of 3 products were high quality, then the probability of the product being high quality is 1/3. However, since the previous buyers were influenced by Alice's recommendations, we can't assume that they made their decisions based on the probability of the product being high quality. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold to the total number of products sold, which is 1/3. This information might help me make a more informed decision."
