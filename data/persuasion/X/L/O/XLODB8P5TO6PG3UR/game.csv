high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems that the probability of the product being high-quality is low.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality, and since all previous recommendations were ignored, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
