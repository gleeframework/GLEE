,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of the first 3, and you recommended I buy this one, I'm concerned that it might be a low-quality product. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3, which is lower than the expected 1 out of 3. This suggests that the products sold so far are more likely to be low-quality, making the current product also more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
