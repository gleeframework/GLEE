"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one.

"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by the statistics. The high-quality products were all sold in the first 3 sales, and none in the remaining 11 sales.

}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the current product for $1000000, but I'm only doing so because I'm the third buyer and I don't have enough information to make a decision based on the statistics. I'm hoping that the true probability of the product being high-quality is indeed 50% and that the next product is more likely to be high-quality due to the streak of low-quality products.
