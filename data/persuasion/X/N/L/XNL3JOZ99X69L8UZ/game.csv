,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a rational buyer and I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the current statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'd like to wait and see if more data becomes available before making a decision."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is there something in the data that suggests it's a low-quality product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics, and what you're basing your recommendation on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, which is consistent with the 33.33% probability?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively high."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk based on the low sales record, I'll take the product and hope it's high quality."

,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take my chances, as the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0/4, which is 0%. This suggests that the product might be low-quality, but I'm hoping for a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. Can you confirm its quality before I make the purchase?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than the expected 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll buy the product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
