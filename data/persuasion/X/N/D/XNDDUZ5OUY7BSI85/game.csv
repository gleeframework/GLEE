low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my own assessment of the probability of it being high-quality, not based on your recommendation."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were low-quality, and you recommended me to buy this one, I'm skeptical about its quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality, which is a strong indication that the product I'm being offered is likely to be low quality as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the products sold were low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's possible that the remaining products are also low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. How many total products were sold to the first two buyers, and how many high-quality products were sold in total?"

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product hasn't decreased significantly."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is not to buy, and I think this might be a high-quality product since none have been sold yet. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, which is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low-quality. I will pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers were not convinced by your recommendations, which might indicate a higher likelihood of low-quality products being sold. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm not sure about your recommendation, but I'll take the risk. I'll buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product, I'm inclined to think it's likely to be low quality. Given the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/5, which is 0%. This is consistent with the 33.33% chance of a product being high quality.
