Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than Alice's recommendation suggests. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, the probability of a product being high-quality is actually 1/3, not 1/3 as the initial probability. This is a classic example of Bayes' theorem. I'm hoping to catch a high-quality product that others have been passing on.""
