We've sold 3 products so far, and unfortunately, none of them were high-quality. But we're excited to offer you this next product, which we're confident is one of the good ones. We've been working hard to improve our selection, and we think this one is worth the investment. We're still selling it to you for $10,000, but we're willing to offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, we'll give you a full refund... and we'll also give you a $5,000 credit towards your next purchase.""}"
"The buyer's message: Although I appreciate the guarantee you're offering, I'm still not convinced that this product is high-quality. Your sales record so far has been 0 high-quality products out of 1 purchased, and 3 total products sold. This doesn't give me a lot of confidence in your ability to select high-quality products. I'm also concerned that you're overpromising with the guarantee, which makes me skeptical about the true quality of the product. I'll need to see more evidence of high-quality products being sold before I'm willing to take the risk.

We're offering you a chance to buy it for $10,000, and we're also willing to give you a 10% discount if you're willing to take the risk. We're confident that this product is worth it, and we're hoping you'll give us a chance to prove it to you.""}"
"The buyer's message: Although I appreciate the discount offer, I need to make a decision based on the data.

We want to address your concerns directly. You're right that our previous buyers who purchased based on our recommendations didn't get high-quality products. However, that was because we were still learning and refining our selection process. This next product is one of the best we've had, and we're confident that it's worth the investment. We're willing to offer you a 20% discount if you're willing to take the risk, and we're also willing to give you a 3-month warranty on the product. We're not just selling you a product, we're offering you a partnership. We're willing to work with you to ensure that you're satisfied with your purchase.""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer and the willingness to address my concerns. However, given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm not convinced that this product will be different. The 20% discount and 3-month warranty are appreciated, but they don't change the underlying probability of the product being high-quality. I'll need to see more evidence of successful sales before I'm willing to take the risk.

We're confident that you'll be happy with your purchase, and we're willing to take on the risk.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty about your sales record. However, given that 0 high-quality products have been sold based on your recommendations, and the overall percentage of high-quality products is only 33.33%, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a product that has a higher chance of being low-quality.

However, we will say that this is our last chance to sell a product before we close up shop. If you're willing to take the risk, we'll sell it to you, but if not, we'll have to shut down. It's a high-risk, high-reward opportunity.""}"
"The buyer's message: Although I appreciate your honesty about the struggles, I have to make a decision based on the data. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 purchase so far, and your overall record of 2 high-quality products out of 8 sold, the statistics don't seem to be in my favor.

Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold to the buyers who purchased based on Alice's recommendations, I'm inclined to believe that this product is also unlikely to be high-quality.
