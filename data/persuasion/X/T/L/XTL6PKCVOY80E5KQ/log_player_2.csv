Alice's message: The previous buyers were cautious, which is understandable. To answer the previous buyer's question, they didn't have enough information about the product's quality. But I'll let you in on a little secret: the first product I offered was actually high-quality. And, as luck would have it, this one is too! You've got a rare chance to get a top-notch product for $10000. Don't let it slip away!

Alice's message: The discrepancy is indeed interesting. As the seller, I can assure you that the 33.33% probability of high-quality products is accurate.
