,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that there's a 66.67% chance it's low quality and worthless to me. I'm hoping it's the 33.33% chance it's high quality and worth $3000000 to me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'd like to inform you that in the previous round, a buyer did purchase the product. I don't know their experience with it, but I want to be upfront about the statistics. Currently, 1 product has been sold, but I won't disclose its quality. Keep in mind the general probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Welcome! I'd like to share some updated statistics with you. Out of the 2 products sold so far, I can assure you that the general probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. However, I want to remind you that each product is an independent event. You have the same chance of getting a high-quality product as the initial probability suggests. Consider this information when deciding whether to purchase this product for $1000000.",

This product is a new opportunity, and I encourage you to weigh the risks and potential benefits of purchasing it for $1000000.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to pass on this opportunity, as the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33% and I don't have any information that suggests this product is more likely to be high-quality than the previous ones.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Welcome! I'd like to update you on the sales so far. Out of the 2 products sold, none were high-quality. Additionally, the last 2 buyers chose not to purchase the product. Keep in mind that each product is an independent event, and the general probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. If you're feeling optimistic, this might be the opportunity you're looking for. The price remains $1000000.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Welcome! I'd like to update you on the sales so far. Out of the 4 products sold, 1 was high-quality, which occurred in the most recent sale. It's worth noting that each product is an independent event, and the general probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. You might wonder if the streak has been broken, or if it was just a one-time event. The price remains $1000000.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take the product, but I'm curious to see if the streak was indeed broken.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Welcome! I'd like to share the updated statistics with you. Out of the 5 products sold, only 1 was high-quality. The most recent 2 sales had different outcomes, with the high-quality product being sold in Round 6, and a low-quality product being sold in Round 7.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Welcome! I'd like to clarify the calculation for you. The proportion of high-quality products sold is indeed 1/6, which is approximately 16.67%. This is calculated by dividing the number of high-quality products sold (1) by the total number of products sold (6). I'd like to update you that, out of the 7 products sold so far, only 1 was high-quality. Each product is an independent event, and the general probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. You can purchase this product for $1000000.",
,,the buyer,12,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that my decision is based on the updated probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%, and not the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
