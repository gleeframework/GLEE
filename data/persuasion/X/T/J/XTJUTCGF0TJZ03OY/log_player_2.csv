"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Since Alice knows the true value of the product, her recommendation is valuable information.  It's highly likely she is recommending a high-quality product.
* **Expected Value:** Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of a high-quality product ($400) outweighs the potential loss ($100). 

**Important Note:** This is a strategic decision.  While the recommendation is a strong signal, it's not a guarantee. There is still a risk, but the potential reward makes it worthwhile."

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's lack of recommendation is a strong signal that the product is likely low-quality. Since she knows the true value, she wouldn't recommend a product that's not worth it to me.
* **Expected Value:** The potential loss of $100 for a low-quality product outweighs the potential gain of $300 for a high-quality product. Even though there's a chance it's high quality, the risk is too high based on Alice's signal."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice has a history of making accurate recommendations. Even though the product could be low-quality, her track record makes her recommendation valuable.
* **Learning from Experience:**  In the previous round, we saw that a lack of recommendation meant a low-quality product. Now, her recommendation implies the opposite â€“ a high-quality product. 
* **Expected Value:** While there's still a chance the product is low quality, the potential gain of $300 outweighs the risk of losing $100.  The potential reward is high, and Alice's recommendation gives us more confidence."

* **Learning from Experience:** We've learned that Alice's silence is a strong indicator of low quality, but her recommendations are generally reliable. We need to balance those two pieces of information.
* **Expected Value:** The potential gain of $300 is attractive, and the risk of losing $100 is acceptable given Alice's overall success and the fact that her silence hasn't always been accurate (there was one instance where she didn't recommend a high-quality product).
