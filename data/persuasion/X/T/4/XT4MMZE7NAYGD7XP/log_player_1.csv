}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not basing my decision solely on the probability of it being high-quality. I'm considering the fact that 4 out of 5 products were low-quality, which suggests that the actual probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than 50%.

"The buyer's message: I'll take the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not basing my decision solely on the probability of the product being high-quality.

  ""message"": ""I understand your cautious approach. I'm glad you're aware of the limitations of the proportion of high-quality products sold. The 10% discount I offered is indeed a one-time offer, and if you decide to take it, you'll pay $900000. However, if you decide to pay the full price later, that's your prerogative. I've sold 11 products so far, with 8 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products. I'm willing to offer you this product for the same price of $1000000.

I'm willing to pay the full price for the potential upside of getting a high-quality product, which is worth $1200000 to me. I'm also considering the fact that you've been transparent about your sales record, and I appreciate the offer.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency and the sales record. However, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. The fact that you're still offering it at the same price after selling 12 products suggests that the law of large numbers hasn't kicked in yet, and the proportion of high-quality products might be due to chance.
