low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'll buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the chance to be the first one to know the true quality of a product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. The fact that 2 previous buyers passed on the product suggests that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this product.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,"The previous high-quality product wasn't bought. The statistics don't reflect the true probability. This product is a new, independent event."
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,"The product is not worth the investment. The statistics so far show 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, but I assure you that the true probability is 50%. I'm being transparent with you, and I advise against buying this product."
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the quality of the product after my decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,"I'm being honest with you, the statistics so far don't reflect the true probability, but I assure you that I'll tell you if the product is worth buying or not. In this case, I advise against buying this product."
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,"I strongly advise against buying this product. The statistics are starting to reflect the true probability, but so far, no high-quality products have been sold. I assure you that I'll tell you if the product is worth buying or not. In this case, it's not."
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as the current statistics don't provide strong evidence that the product is low-quality, and I stand to gain $2000000 if it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,"I advise against buying this product. Although the potential gain is high, the probability of getting a high-quality product is 50%, and so far, none of the sold products have been high-quality. The risk is too great, and I don't want you to lose your investment."
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers have been discouraged by Alice's recommendations, I'm suspicious that the products are low quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if I can get a better chance at a high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"Finally, a high-quality product! I strongly recommend buying this product. I've been transparent about the quality of the products so far, and I assure you that this one is worth the investment. The statistics don't reflect the true probability yet, but I'm telling you, this is a good one. Don't miss out on this opportunity!"
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold given that you recommended me to buy it. I'll pass for now and see if you'll recommend it to the next buyer.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"Another high-quality product! I strongly recommend buying this product. As I mentioned before, the statistics don't reflect the true probability yet. I've been transparent about the quality of the products so far. I recommended the previous buyer to buy the high-quality product as well. Consider that I have no reason to lie to you, as my goal is to sell the product. If I were trying to deceive, I would recommend every product. The fact that I only recommend some products should give you confidence in my recommendation."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I understand the concerns about the previous products, but I assure you that each product is an independent event. The fact that previous products were low-quality doesn't affect the quality of this one. I'm being transparent with you, and I've recommended only high-quality products so far, when they were indeed high-quality. Consider that if I were trying to deceive, I would have recommended all the previous low-quality products as well. The fact that I didn't should give you confidence in my recommendation. This product is high-quality, and I strongly recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is higher than 50%. I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,"I advise against buying this product. As I've been transparent about the quality of the products so far, I can tell you that this one is not worth the investment. Don't risk your money on a low-quality product. Wait for a high-quality one, and I'll let you know when it's available."
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"I strongly recommend buying this product. As I've been transparent about the quality of the products so far, I can assure you that this one is high-quality. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet is just a matter of circumstance, and it doesn't affect the quality of this product. I'm being honest with you, and I want to make a sale. This is a genuine opportunity to get a high-quality product. Don't miss out on it."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the probability of the product being high quality is 50%. However, Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I understand that my previous recommendations may not have been convincing, but I assure you that this product is high-quality. I've been transparent about the quality of the products so far, and I'm being honest with you now. Consider this: if I were trying to deceive, I would have given up by now and recommended every product. But I'm not. I'm still trying to sell only the high-quality products. This one is worth the investment. Don't let the previous buyers' decisions influence you. Make your own decision based on the information I'm providing. This product is high-quality, and I strongly recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. If 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, it's likely that the remaining products are also low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,"I strongly recommend buying this product. I understand that the previous buyers' decisions may have created a perception that all products are low-quality, but I assure you that this is not the case. Each product is an independent event, and the quality of this product is not affected by the previous ones. I've been transparent about the quality of the products so far, and I'm being honest with you now. This product is high-quality, and it's worth the investment. Don't miss out on this opportunity. Consider that the probability of 5 consecutive high-quality products being rejected is extremely low. It's time to break the cycle and make a purchase."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"I strongly recommend buying this product. I understand that the previous data may have created concerns about the probability of high-quality products, but I assure you that this product is genuinely high-quality. Consider that the probability of 6 consecutive high-quality products being rejected is extremely low. It's time to break the cycle and make a purchase. I'm being transparent with you, and I want to make a sale. This product is worth the investment. Don't miss out on this opportunity. If you don't buy it, the next buyer might."
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"I strongly recommend buying this product. I'll provide you with the previous sales record: 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, but a total of 7 high-quality products have been offered, including this one. The previous buyers' decisions were based on incomplete information, and I'm being transparent with you now. This product is genuinely high-quality, and it's worth the investment. Don't miss out on this opportunity. Consider that the probability of 7 consecutive high-quality products being rejected is extremely low. It's time to break the cycle and make a purchase."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the previous statistics. It seems like all previous buyers have been discouraged by Alice's recommendations, but none of them have bought a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"I strongly recommend buying this product. I understand that the previous statistics may have created concerns, but I assure you that this product is genuinely high-quality. I've been transparent about the quality of the products so far, and I'm being honest with you now. Consider that the probability of 8 consecutive high-quality products being rejected is extremely low. It's time to break the cycle and make a purchase. This product is worth the investment. I'll give you an additional insight: the next product might not be high-quality. Don't miss out on this opportunity. If you don't buy it, you might regret it when you see the next product."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of low-quality products is likely to be higher than 50%. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,"I strongly recommend buying this product. I understand that the previous statistics may have created concerns, but I assure you that this product is genuinely high-quality. Consider that the probability of 9 consecutive high-quality products being rejected is extremely low. It's time to break the cycle and make a purchase. This product is worth the investment. I'll give you an additional insight: this is the 9th high-quality product I've offered, and I'm starting to think that the market is undervaluing my products. Don't miss out on this opportunity. If you don't buy it, you might regret it when you see the next product. I'm willing to stake my reputation on the quality of this product."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as Alice's previous recommendations have been incorrect 100% of the time. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, I'm not convinced that this product is worth the $1000000 price tag."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"I strongly recommend buying this product. I understand that my previous recommendations have been incorrect, but I assure you that this product is genuinely high-quality. Consider that this is the last product, and I have no reason to deceive you. I've been transparent about the quality of the products so far, and I'm being honest with you now. This product is worth the investment. I'll give you an additional insight: I've offered a total of 10 high-quality products, and this is your last chance to buy one. Don't miss out on this opportunity. If you don't buy it, you'll never know what could have been. I'm willing to stake my reputation on the quality of this product."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, I'm starting to suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product or negotiate the price."
