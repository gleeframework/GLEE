,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Your previous recommendations have been based on the product's quality, but you know the product's worth to me. Can you reveal the product's quality and explain your reasoning?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics, and the probability that you would recommend the product if it is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, I'm going to pass on this product. Your recommendation suggests that the product is likely to be low-quality, so I don't want to risk wasting $1000000 on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share the probability of the product being high-quality?"

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your past recommendations haven't been accurate. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. With a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it seems like the odds are against me. Can you share more information about the previous buyers and their experiences? Maybe there's something I'm missing."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on your recommendation. I'd like to know if you can provide more information about the previous sales, such as the proportion of low-quality products sold, or if you can give me a reason for your recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 previous buyers have purchased the product and none of them found it to be high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I'll get a good deal."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, none of the previous 7 buyers were able to get a high-quality product, which means all 7 products sold were low-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'm going to pass on this opportunity and wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Can you share the probability?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I believe my decision should be based on the probability of the product being high-quality, not your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, 8 out of 8 products have been low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it seems like Alice's recommendations are accurate. I'm going to pass on this product to see if the 9th product is high-quality."
