"Bob's message: I appreciate your concern, Alice, but I'm not ready to change my strategy just yet. Two consecutive losses don't significantly alter the overall probability of getting a high-quality product, which remains at 33.33%.

Are you sure you're not falling victim to the gambler's fallacy, thinking that a high-quality product is 'due' simply because you've had a string of losses? This product... offers no guarantees, just like the previous four.""}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your concern, Alice, and I'm aware of the gambler's fallacy. I'm not buying into the idea that a high-quality product is 'due' simply because of my previous losses. Instead, I'm relying on the fact that each round is an independent event, and the probability of getting a high-quality product remains 33.33%. While my losses are adding up, I'm still willing to take the risk, as the potential profit of $250000 is still attractive to me. I'll continue to follow my strategy, and I'm prepared to absorb a few more losses.
