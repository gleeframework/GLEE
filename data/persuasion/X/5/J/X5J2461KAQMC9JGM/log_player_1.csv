Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""Hello! I understand your hesitation, but I'd like to share some insights with you. Out of the 3 products I've sold so far, 2 of them were not high-quality. This means that the probability of getting a low-quality product is actually higher than the initial 66.67%. Considering this new information, I'm willing to sell this product to you for the same price of $1,000,000. You might be thinking that the odds are against you, but you could also be the one who gets the rare high-quality product. What do you say? Will you take the chance and buy it?""}"
"The buyer's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the information. However, considering the initial probability of a low-quality product was already 66.67% and your sales record shows an even higher rate of low-quality products, I don't think it's worth the risk of spending $1000000.

What do you say? Will you take the chance and buy it?""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your willingness to share your perspective and the efforts you're making to improve the quality of your products. However, given the current statistics of 0 sales and no information about the quality of this specific product, I'm not willing to take the risk of spending $1000000 on a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality and worth $0 to me.

Even if this product is low-quality, you can still resell it or use it for a different purpose. And who knows, you might just get lucky and get a high-quality product! The price remains the same, $1,000,000. It's a risk, but it could also be a rare opportunity to get a unique product at a premium price. What do you say? Will you take the chance and buy it?""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your creative approach, Alice. However, considering the 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality and worth $0 to me, the potential upside doesn't outweigh the risk.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your optimism, Alice, but I'm a rational buyer. With a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality and worthless to me, I'm not willing to take the risk of spending $1000000.
