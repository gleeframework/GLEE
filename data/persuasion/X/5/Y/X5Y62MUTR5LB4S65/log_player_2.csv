Alice's message: Congratulations on considering my product! With over 10 products sold, I'm proud to say that 60% of them have been high-quality. This one looks like it might be one of them too! Would you like to take a chance and see if it's a winner?

Alice's message: No worries at all! I understand you're being cautious. Let me give you a bit more context: I've sold 12 products now, and the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products is still 60% to 40%. This one, in particular, looks like it might be a real gem.
