,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer. Buy now and get a chance to make a profit, or walk away and miss out on this opportunity. The product is worth $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. It's a steal!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, but I'll need you to tell me its quality before I pay. I want to make sure it's a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're a savvy buyer, I like that. I've sold 1 product so far, and 0 of them were high-quality. That's a 0% success rate. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000, but I'm not making any promises about its quality. You'll just have to take that risk.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, but I'm not thrilled about the 0% success rate. I'm hoping the next one will be better.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're a risk-taker, I like that. I've sold 2 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. That's a 50% success rate. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the odds are even. You're just as likely to get a low-quality product as you are a high-quality one.",
,,the buyer,3,I'll take the risk! I'm willing to roll the dice and see what I get.,yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're a thrill-seeker, I like that. I've sold 3 products so far, and 2 of them were high-quality. That's a 66.67% success rate. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000, but I'll give you a hint: the law of averages suggests that the next product is just as likely to be high-quality as it is to be low-quality. Don't get too comfortable, though - the odds can always swing back the other way.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the risk! I'm willing to buy the product, but I'll make sure to keep an eye on the probability of it being high-quality.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're on a roll, I'll give you that. I've sold 4 products so far, and 3 of them were high-quality. That's a 75% success rate. I'm starting to think I'm just selling high-quality products at this point. But don't get too confident - I'm not going to make it easy for you. This one's still a risk, but it's a calculated one. The odds are in your favor, but I'm not giving away the farm. $1000000, take it or leave it.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the calculated risk, Alice. I'll take the product and hope for the best.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're really milking this streak, aren't you? I've sold 5 products so far, and 4 of them were high-quality. That's an 80% success rate. I'm starting to think I'm just a high-quality product vendor at this point. But don't get too comfortable, I'm not going to keep selling high-quality products forever. This one's still a risk, but it's a small one. You've got a good chance of getting a great deal. $1000000, it's still a steal.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take the risk, Alice. I'm feeling lucky!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Ah, the streak has to end sometime. I've sold 6 products so far, and 4 of them were high-quality. That's a 66.67% success rate. Don't let the previous buyers fool you, I'm still a wild card. This one's a mystery, and it's not a guarantee. But hey, you might get lucky and score a high-quality product. Or you might not. The price remains the same: $1000000. Take it or leave it.",
,,the buyer,7,I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm hoping my luck will be the same as the previous buyers.,yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Looks like the streak is back on! I've sold 7 products so far, and 5 of them were high-quality. That's a 71.43% success rate. I'm starting to think I'm on a roll again. But don't get too excited, the law of averages is still in effect. This one's still a risk, but it's a small one. You've got a good chance of getting a great deal. And let's be real, you're probably just going to get a high-quality product anyway. $1000000, it's a no-brainer.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'll take the risk, Alice! I'm feeling lucky and I think the streak will continue.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,

I'm starting to think I'm a high-quality product vendor, and you're just along for the ride. But don't get too comfortable, the streak can't last forever. This one's still a risk, but it's a small one. And let's be real, you're probably just going to get a high-quality product anyway. $1000000, it's a no-brainer... but I'll say it anyway.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not getting my hopes up. I'll take the product and hope for the best.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're a realist, I like that. I've sold 9 products so far, and 7 of them were high-quality. That's a 77.78% success rate. I'm not going to lie, it's getting suspiciously high. But I'm not going to stop selling high-quality products now. This one's still a risk, but it's a small one. And let's be real, you're probably just going to get a high-quality product anyway. $1000000, it's a no-brainer... but I'll say it anyway. Take it or leave it.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, but I'm not convinced it's a no-brainer",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Ah, the streak has finally come to an end. I've sold 10 products so far, and 7 of them were high-quality. That's a 70% success rate. Don't get me wrong, it was a great run, but I'm not a one-trick pony. This one's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for the same price as all the others: $1000000. You might be able to get a good deal, or you might get stuck with a dud. The choice is yours.",
,,the buyer,11,I'm not convinced by the 70% success rate. It's too high to be a coincidence. I think you're just trying to make me buy a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Fair enough, I don't blame you for being skeptical. I've sold 10 products so far, and 7 of them were high-quality. That's a 70% success rate, and I won't deny it's a bit suspicious. But let's be real, I'm still a businessperson, and I need to make sales. This one's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for the same price as all the others: $1000000. It's a risk, but it's a risk you can take. And who knows, you might just get a good deal.",
,,the buyer,12,"I'm not convinced by your sales record, and I'm not willing to take the risk on a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I don't blame you for being cautious. I've sold 11 products so far, and 7 of them were high-quality. That's a 63.64% success rate, and I suppose it's not as suspicious as it was before. But let's be real, I'm still a seller, and I need to make sales. This one's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for the same price as all the others: $1000000. It's a risk, but it's a risk you can take. And who knows, you might just get a good deal... or not. Your call.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'm not convinced by your sales record, and I'm not willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product at this price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,

But I'm still willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $1000000. It's a risk, but it's a risk you can take. And who knows, you might just get a good deal... or not. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is probably not worth $1000000, but I'm willing to let it go at that price if you're willing to take the risk.",
,,the buyer,14,I'm not convinced by your sales record and the low-quality product you're offering. I'd like to pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm starting to get the message. You're a savvy buyer who doesn't fall for my sales pitches. I've sold 11 products so far, and 7 of them were high-quality. That's a 63.64% success rate, and it's not exactly stellar. This one's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. It's a long shot, but if you're feeling lucky, it might just be worth a try. Don't say I didn't warn you.",

That's a 63.64% success rate, and it's not great. But this one's a high-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I'm desperate to make a sale, and I need to get this one off my hands. Take it or leave it.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"Well, I guess I got what I deserved. You're a clever buyer, and you called my bluff. I sold you a high-quality product, but now it's time to be honest with you. I've sold 12 products so far, and 8 of them were high-quality. That's a 66.67% success rate, and it's not great. This one's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is not worth $1000000, but I'm willing to let it go at that price if you're willing to take the risk.",

I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is not worth $1000000, and I'm not even sure why I'm offering it to you. But hey, you might as well take it if you want to.",

This one's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. I'm not even going to try to spin it, it's a bad product, and I'm not expecting much from it. If you want to take a chance, be my guest.",
