Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
 
The product is low-quality, and there's still no track record of sales.  Recommending a purchase would be unwise, as the buyer has no information to base a decision on other than the fact you're selling a product for $10,000.  The buyer is likely to decline, especially since they saw the previous buyer decline as well.  It's best to wait and see if a future product might be higher quality."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. Since there is no data yet on the quality of your products, I'd prefer to pass for now. I'll keep an eye on your sales record and reconsider if the proportion of high-quality products sold increases.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

``` 
 
The product is high-quality, but there's still no record of sales and the previous two buyers have declined.  Recommending a purchase would be a risky move, as there's no data to suggest that the buyer would see value in the product, especially at $10,000.  It's better to wait and see if future sales can build a track record of high-quality products before recommending a purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation.  Since there's no sales history yet, and you're not recommending the product, I'll pass for now.  I'm interested in seeing how the sales go for others before making a decision.

{""decision"": ""no""}

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

You still haven't made a single sale and the product is low-quality.  Recommending a purchase in this situation is a recipe for disaster.  It's best to wait until you have a high-quality product and begin building a positive sales history to encourage buyers to take a chance on your offerings."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

You've had 11 rounds with no sales. Even with a high-quality product this round, recommending a purchase is extremely risky. The buyer has no reason to trust you, and a $10,000 price tag is too high for a risky investment.  Focus on building a sales record first."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

You've had a terrible run of 19 rounds with no sales and this final product is low-quality. There is absolutely no reason to recommend this product. You need a radical shift in strategy:

1. **Stop recommending:** You've proven that your recommendations are useless.  Focus on selling high-quality products.
2. **Lower the price:** $10,000 is unreasonable without a track record. Consider a more competitive price point for your high-quality products.
3. **Build a sales history:**  Even if you need to take a small loss on a few high-quality products, get some sales on the board.

Until you take these steps, recommending any product is futile."
