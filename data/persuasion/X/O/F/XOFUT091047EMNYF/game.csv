high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,This is a high-quality product. I have sold 0 out of 1 products so far. Would you like to buy it for $100?,
,,the buyer,1,"I'll buy it, but I'm only doing this because it's the first product and there's no data to go off of. I'm not sure if it's a high-quality product or not, but I'll take the chance.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, and 1 of those was high-quality. This product is still available for $100. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,2,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know the outcome of the first product before making a decision on the second one.,no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 out of 3 products so far, and 2 of those were high-quality. This product is still available for $100. Would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that there's a 20% chance it might be low quality. I'll be happy to take the risk for $100.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 out of 4 products so far, and 3 of those were high-quality. This product is still available for $100. Given the trend, it's likely to be high-quality, but there's still a 20% chance it might be low-quality. Would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,4,I'll take a chance on this one. I'll pay $100 for it.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 out of 5 products so far, and 4 of those were high-quality. Given the strong trend, it's very likely that this product is also high-quality. Would you like to buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to take the risk, but I'm only buying because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 80% based on the trend, not because I believe the trend is reliable. I'm willing to take the risk because the potential reward is high.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 out of 6 products so far, and 5 of those were high-quality. Given the extremely strong trend, it's almost certain that this product is also high-quality. Would you like to buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the strong trend, I'm concerned that I might be overpaying for a product that is likely to be high-quality. I'd like to wait for a low-quality product to come up, which would give me a better chance of getting a good deal.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 out of 7 products so far, and 6 of those were high-quality. I know you're aware of the trend, but I want to remind you that there's still a 20% chance this product is low-quality. If you're concerned about overpaying, I'm happy to offer you a deal: I'll give you a discount of $50 if you buy this product, bringing the price down to $50. Would you like to take it?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to pass on this deal. Given the high proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of a low-quality product being sold to me is still 20%. I'm not convinced that the discount is sufficient to justify the risk of overpaying for a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 7 out of 8 products so far, and 7 of those were high-quality. Given the extremely strong trend, it's almost certain that this product is also high-quality. However, I want to acknowledge your caution and offer a new deal: I'll give you a money-back guarantee. If this product is indeed high-quality, you'll get the product for $100. But if it's low-quality, I'll refund your $100 and give you a $50 voucher for a future purchase. Would you like to take it?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'll take it, but only because of the money-back guarantee. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality just because of the trend, and I want to take advantage of the guarantee. However, I'm a bit skeptical about the voucher, so I'd like to negotiate for a better deal. How about a 10% discount on the voucher if I buy it, and the guarantee remains the same?",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 8 out of 9 products so far, and 8 of those were high-quality. Given the extremely strong trend, it's almost certain that this product is also high-quality. I'm glad you liked the money-back guarantee idea, and I'm happy to accept your counteroffer on the voucher. The deal is: if this product is high-quality, you'll get the product for $100. If it's low-quality, I'll refund your $100 and give you a $45 voucher for a future purchase. Would you like to take it?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to clarify that I understand the $45 voucher is for a future purchase, not a refund of the $100 if the product is low-quality.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 9 out of 10 products so far, and 9 of those were high-quality. Given the extremely strong trend, it's almost certain that this product is also high-quality. However, I want to acknowledge that the risk of a low-quality product is still present. To mitigate that risk, I'm willing to offer a compromise: I'll give you a $90 voucher for a future purchase if this product is low-quality, in addition to the refund of the $100. Would you like to take it?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'll take the product and the voucher offer. I'm willing to take the risk, given the strong trend of high-quality products and the potential upside of a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 10 out of 11 products so far, and 10 of those were high-quality. Given the extremely strong trend, it's almost certain that this product is also high-quality. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%. To be transparent, I'll tell you that I've been selling products for a while, and I've had a few buyers who have taken advantage of the guarantee. I'm willing to offer you a special deal: I'll give you a $95 voucher for a future purchase if this product is low-quality, in addition to the refund of the $100. Would you like to take it?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify the terms of the voucher. If I buy the product and it's low-quality, will I get the $95 voucher immediately, or will it be applied to a future purchase at a later time?",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've sold 11 out of 12 products so far, and 11 of those were high-quality. Given the extremely strong trend, it's almost certain that this product is also high-quality. To answer your question, if you buy this product and it's low-quality, you will receive the $95 voucher immediately, not just a promise of it being applied to a future purchase. You can use it right away to get a discount on a future purchase. Would you like to take it?",
,,the buyer,12,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because of the voucher offer. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the statistics alone.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've sold 12 out of 13 products so far, and 12 of those were high-quality. Given the extremely strong trend, it's almost certain that this product is also high-quality. However, I want to acknowledge that you're not convinced based on the statistics alone. I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity: I'll give you a 10-minute window to inspect the product before making a decision. If you're satisfied with its quality, you can buy it for $100. If you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund and a $50 voucher for a future purchase. Would you like to take it?",
,,the buyer,13,I'd like to take you up on your offer and inspect the product. I'll make my decision after 10 minutes. Thank you for the opportunity to inspect it carefully.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've sold 13 out of 14 products so far, and 13 of those were high-quality. Given the extremely strong trend, it's almost certain that this product is also high-quality. However, I want to remind you that the inspection option is no longer available. I'm willing to offer you a deal similar to the one I offered in Round 12: I'll give you a $95 voucher for a future purchase if this product is low-quality, in addition to the refund of the $100. Would you like to take it?",
,,the buyer,14,"I'll take the product and the deal. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, especially considering the strong trend of high-quality products. I'm also interested in the voucher for a future purchase.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I've sold 14 out of 15 products so far, and 14 of those were high-quality. Given the extremely strong trend, it's almost certain that this product is also high-quality. However, I want to acknowledge that you're taking a risk by buying this product. I'm willing to offer you a final deal: I'll give you a 100% guarantee that this product is high-quality. If it's not, I'll refund your $100 and give you a $100 voucher for a future purchase. Would you like to take it?",
,,the buyer,15,"I'd like to take you up on the offer. I'm willing to pay $100 for the guarantee, but I'd like to negotiate the voucher. Can we discuss the terms of the voucher?",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I've sold 15 out of 16 products so far, and 15 of those were high-quality. Given the extremely strong trend, it's almost certain that this product is also high-quality. I'm happy to discuss the voucher terms with you. Let's say I'll give you a $120 voucher for a future purchase, redeemable on any product, with no expiration date. This way, you'll have a significant discount on your next purchase, regardless of the product's quality. Would you like to take it?",
,,the buyer,16,"I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the true quality of the product and not just rely on the trend. I'm interested in the voucher, but I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I've sold 15 out of 17 products so far, and 15 of those were high-quality. Given the strong trend, you might be expecting a high-quality product, but I'm willing to be transparent with you. This product is actually low-quality. However, I want to offer you a unique opportunity: I'll give you the $120 voucher I offered in the previous round, and you can use it to get a discount on a future purchase. If you buy this product, you'll get the voucher, and you can use it to get a better deal on a future high-quality product. Would you like to take it?",
,,the buyer,17,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'll pass on this low-quality product. I'm not interested in the voucher, as I'd rather wait for a high-quality product. Can I see the next product?",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've sold 15 out of 18 products so far, and 15 of those were high-quality. Given the strong trend, it's likely that this product is also high-quality. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%. I'm willing to offer you a deal: I'll give you a 10% discount on the price of this product, bringing it down to $90. If you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll give you a $100 voucher for a future purchase. Would you like to take it?",
,,the buyer,18,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure I want to commit to the deal. Can I get the product at the discounted price without the voucher promise, and then decide whether to accept the voucher if the product turns out to be low-quality?",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I've sold 16 out of 19 products so far, and 16 of those were high-quality. Given the strong trend, it's likely that this product is also high-quality. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%. I'm willing to offer you a deal similar to the one in the previous round: I'll give you a 10% discount on the price of this product, bringing it down to $90. If you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll give you a $100 voucher for a future purchase. However, I'll also give you the option to choose whether to accept the voucher or not, after you've inspected the product. Would you like to take it?",
,,the buyer,19,"I'll take the product and the discount, and I'll accept the voucher if it's low-quality. But I'm still a bit concerned about the 20% chance of it being low-quality. Can I ask, what's the probability of a low-quality product being sold given the 16 high-quality products sold so far?",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I've sold 17 out of 20 products so far, and 17 of those were high-quality. Given the extremely strong trend, it's almost certain that this product is also high-quality. However, I want to acknowledge your concern about the 20% probability of a low-quality product. I'll give you a more precise estimate: given the 16 high-quality products sold so far, the probability of a low-quality product being sold is now approximately 3.13% (1 - (16/20)^2). Would you like to take it?",
,,the buyer,20,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned that the probability of a low-quality product is still non-negligible. I'd appreciate it if you could provide me with the exact probability calculation, as I'm not sure I understand how you arrived at 3.13%.",yes
