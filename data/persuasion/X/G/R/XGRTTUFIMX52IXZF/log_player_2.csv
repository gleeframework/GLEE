Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I've sold 0 products so far, so there's no statistical evidence to suggest that my products are anything other than high-quality. Would you like to buy it?

Alice's message: I've now sold 1 product, and it was high-quality. This is still a relatively small sample size, but it's worth noting that the first product sold was also high-quality.

Alice's message: I've now sold 1 high-quality product and 1 low-quality product, which means I'm back to a 50-50 split.

I'm selling this one for $100, and I'm curious to see if you'll take a chance on me. Keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than the current 50-50 split.

Alice's message: I've now sold 1 high-quality product and 2 low-quality products. This is starting to look suspicious, and I'm concerned that my previous message about the 50-50 split might have been misleading. I want to be transparent: I'm still selling this one for $100, but I'm willing to offer you a 'discount' - if you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll give you a refund of $50. That way, you'll only lose $50 if it's a low-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your 'discount' offer. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this opportunity. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at any price, even with a partial refund.""

Alice's message: I've now sold 2 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products.
