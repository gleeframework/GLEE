,,Alice,3,"You're right to be cautious! But I'm glad you're willing to take a chance. I've sold 2 high-quality products now, and 1 low-quality product. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100. Given the balance of high-quality to low-quality products, I think this one has a good chance of being high-quality as well. Would you like to buy it?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products now, but I've also sold 2 low-quality products. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but I'm starting to think that the last two products might have been a fluke. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product, but I'm going to do some quick math to update my probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics you provided. With 2 high-quality products out of 4 total products sold, my updated probability of the product being high-quality is 2/4 = 0.5, which is still 50%. I'll take the product and hope it's high-quality!",yes
