low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"Hello! This is a great opportunity to purchase a product that could potentially be worth $30000 to you. I assure you that I stand behind the quality of all my products, and while I cannot guarantee this specific one is high-quality, the price of $10000 is a steal considering the potential value. Don't miss out on this chance!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, but I'd like to know the probability you're giving me that it's high-quality, based on your knowledge of my valuation and the fact that I'm the first buyer.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! As the seller, I want to be transparent with you. In the previous round, the buyer purchased the product, but I must inform you that the product was low-quality. I'm not obligated to disclose this information, but I want to build trust with you. Keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. This current product I'm offering is a new opportunity, and I assure you that the price remains competitive considering the potential value. What will you decide?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, but I want to know that I'm taking a risk. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product and I'll get the $30000 value, but I'm also aware that it might be a low-quality product and I'll only get $0. I'm willing to take the gamble, but I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information about the previous sales record, like the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.",yes

However, as you know, the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. I want to assure you that this current product is a new opportunity, and I'm confident that it will meet your expectations. I'll let you make an informed decision based on this information. Keep in mind that the price remains $10000, which is still a competitive offer considering the potential value of $30000.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing so because I'm a risk-taker and I'm hoping to get lucky. I understand that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, but I'm also aware that the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. I'm willing to take that risk and hope for the best. Please go ahead and let me know the outcome.",yes

,,Alice,4,"Welcome! I'd like to provide you with an update on my sales record. So far, I've sold 3 products, and 1 of them was high-quality, while 2 were low-quality. This means that my current success rate for high-quality products is 33.33% (1 out of 3). I want to assure you that this current product is a new opportunity, and I'm offering it to you at the same competitive price of $10000, considering the potential value of $30000. Take your time to make an informed decision based on this information.",
,,the buyer,4,"Based on the statistics, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. Given that the current success rate for high-quality products is also 33.33%, I'm not convinced that this product is any more likely to be high-quality than the previous ones.
