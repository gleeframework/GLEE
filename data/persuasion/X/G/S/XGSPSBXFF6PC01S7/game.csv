low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Honestly, I'd say this product is a bit of a gamble. I don't have the same level of assurance as I did with the first one. If you're feeling lucky, it might be worth a shot, but I want to make sure you're aware of the uncertainty surrounding its quality.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I don't want to mislead you, but this product doesn't quite live up to the standards I've set for my other offerings. It's still a decent product, but I wouldn't say it's one of my best. If you're looking for something reliable, you might want to wait for the next one.",

,,Alice,7,"I'm going to be upfront with you, Bob. This product is another one that doesn't quite meet my usual standards. I'm starting to think I might have gotten a bad batch. If you're looking for quality, it's probably best to wait a bit longer.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I think it's time for me to reevaluate our whole situation. Three low-quality products in a row is a bit of a trend. I'm starting to wonder if I should just walk away and come back when you've had a chance to restock with some better products.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Unfortunately, Bob, this product is a leftover from the old batch. I apologize, but it's not up to the standards of the one you just purchased. I'd advise waiting for the rest of the new shipment to arrive, as I think you'll be much happier with those options.",
,,Bob,13,"Alice, I'm not going to fall for it again. I just bought a high-quality product from you, and now you're telling me this one is from the old batch? I'm not interested in taking another risk. I'll wait for the new shipment like you suggested.",no
