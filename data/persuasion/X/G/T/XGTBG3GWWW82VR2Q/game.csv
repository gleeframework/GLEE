,,Alice,1,"This is our first product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a unique opportunity to get a great deal on a high-quality item. I'm confident you'll love it!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, but I'll keep in mind that it's the first product and I don't have any prior information about its quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're our second customer, and I'm glad you're interested in this product. I want to assure you that our products are carefully selected, but I also want to be transparent with you. Out of our first product, which was sold to the previous customer, I can tell you that it was indeed a high-quality one. However, I'd like to mention that our overall sales ratio is not as favorable as that one might suggest. In fact, I'd say the quality of our products is roughly 33.33% high-quality, which is publicly known information. Would you like to take a chance on this one for $100?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to take a chance on this product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm aware of the publicly known 33.33% high-quality ratio. I'm hoping my luck will be better than that.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Welcome to our third sale! I'd like to remind you that we've sold two products so far, and one of them was high-quality, while the other was not. Our overall sales ratio remains at 33.33% high-quality products. I'd like to point out that the fact that we've sold two products already, with one being high-quality, doesn't necessarily change the probability of the next product being high-quality. It's still 33.33%. Would you like to take a chance on this one for $100?",
,,the buyer,3,I'll take a chance on this one! I'm hoping it's another high-quality product!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're our fourth customer, and I'm glad you're considering purchasing from us. I'd like to share some information with you. Out of our first three sales, two products were low-quality, and one was high-quality. This means that the ratio of low-quality to high-quality products is 2:1. Considering this, I'd like to offer you a unique deal: I'll give you a 50% discount on this product if you buy it now. The price would be $50. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",
,,the buyer,4,I'd like to think about it. Can I get more information about the distribution of high-quality products before making a decision? Maybe there's a pattern emerging that would help me make a more informed choice.,no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Welcome to our fifth sale! I'd like to update you on our sales record. We've sold four products so far, with one high-quality product and three low-quality products. This means that the ratio of low-quality to high-quality products is indeed 3:1. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, as it's based on the overall distribution of products, not the specific sequence of sales. Considering this, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-quality product for $100. It's a great chance to get a high-quality item at a fair price!",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to take the chance and buy the product, considering the low ratio of high-quality products sold so far and the probability of the product being high-quality remains 33.33%",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're our sixth customer, and I'd like to share some observations with you. We've sold five products so far, with one high-quality product and four low-quality products. The ratio of low-quality to high-quality products is now 4:1. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, as the sequence of sales doesn't change the underlying probability. I'd like to ask you a question: would you like to buy this product for $100, or would you rather wait and see how our sales record develops further?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know if it's high-quality or low-quality before committing to the purchase.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Welcome to our seventh sale! I'd like to update you on our sales record. We've sold six products so far, with two high-quality products and four low-quality products. The ratio of low-quality to high-quality products is now 4:2. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, as the sequence of sales doesn't change the underlying probability. Considering this, I'd like to make a bold statement: I'm so confident in the quality of this product that I'm willing to offer you a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. Would you like to take advantage of this offer and buy the product for $100?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to take advantage of your 100% satisfaction guarantee, but I'm still a little skeptical. I'll buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of the guarantee. If it's low-quality, I expect a full refund.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're our eighth customer, and I'd like to update you on our sales record. We've sold seven products so far, with three high-quality products and four low-quality products. The ratio of low-quality to high-quality products is now 4:3. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, as the sequence of sales doesn't change the underlying probability.

high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Welcome to our ninth sale! I'd like to update you on our sales record. We've sold eight products so far, with four high-quality products and four low-quality products. The ratio of low-quality to high-quality products is now 4:4. This is an interesting development, as it's a 1:1 ratio. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, as the sequence of sales doesn't change the underlying probability. Considering this, I'd like to make a statement: our sales record is now at a neutral point, with an equal number of high-quality and low-quality products. I'm offering you a chance to break the tie and purchase this high-quality product for $100. Would you like to take the opportunity?",

,,Alice,10,"You're our tenth customer, and I'd like to update you on our sales record. We've sold nine products so far, with five high-quality products and four low-quality products. The ratio of low-quality to high-quality products is now 4:5. I'd like to point out that we've had a streak of two high-quality products in a row, but I'd like to remind you that this doesn't change the underlying probability of a product being high-quality, which remains 33.33%. However, I'd like to offer you a special deal on this product. Since we've had an equal number of high-quality and low-quality products at one point, and now we have a 5:4 ratio in favor of high-quality products, I'm willing to offer you a 10% discount on this high-quality product. Would you like to buy it for $90?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'll take the product, but only if it's high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk, given the 10% discount and the recent streak of high-quality products.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Welcome to our eleventh sale! I'd like to update you on our sales record. We've sold ten products so far, with six high-quality products and four low-quality products. The ratio of low-quality to high-quality products is now 4:6. With two consecutive high-quality products, some might think that the probability of a product being high-quality has increased. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability remains 33.33%, as the sequence of sales doesn't change the underlying probability. Considering our previous customer's decision to buy this product only if it's high-quality, I'd like to offer you a different approach. I'll give you a sealed envelope with a message inside. The message will reveal the quality of this product. If you buy the product, you'll get to see the message and decide whether to keep it or return it. The price remains $100. Would you like to take the risk and buy the product?",

,,Alice,12,"Welcome to our twelfth sale! I'd like to assure you that the sealed envelope is indeed sealed and tamper-proof.

I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%, as the sequence of sales doesn't change the underlying probability. However, I'd like to highlight that we've had three consecutive high-quality products, which might be a coincidence or a trend. I'm offering you a chance to purchase this high-quality product for $100, and you'll get to see the sealed envelope's message after the purchase. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll hand you the envelope, and you can make your decision.",
,,the buyer,12,I'd like to think more about the trend you mentioned. I'm not convinced that three consecutive high-quality products is not just a coincidence. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.,no

I'm offering you a chance to purchase this high-quality product for $100. Would you like to take the opportunity?",
