low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,no,I'll pass on this one. What's the quality of the product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not buying. I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but I know it's not worth buying if it's low quality, and the probability of it being low quality is high."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'm not buying. You're recommending it, but I've seen two low-quality products in a row, and the probability of this one being low quality is still high. I'm not willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Given the previous two low-quality products, I'm not sure if Alice is recommending this one because it's high quality or because she knows it's low quality. But since she's not recommending it, I'll take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,Not again! Two low-quality products in a row. I'm starting to think Alice is just sending me the low-quality ones when she's not recommending them. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Alice is recommending it, which means it's probably high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Alice has recommended two high-quality products in a row, and now she's not recommending this one. I'm not sure if she's trying to trick me or not, but I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"Wait a minute... Alice recommended this one, but the last one she didn't recommend was low-quality. I'm starting to think she's just recommending the high-quality ones and not the low-quality ones. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'll take it. Alice has recommended this one, and I've seen that she only recommends the high-quality ones. I'm confident that this one is worth $125 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"I'm sticking to my strategy. Alice only recommends the high-quality ones, and she's not recommending this one. I'm not buying."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Two low-quality products in a row from Alice not recommending them, I'm starting to think she's not following her pattern. I'll buy it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"Not again! Alice recommends it, but the last one she didn't recommend was low-quality. I'm going to assume she's still following her pattern and only recommends the high-quality ones. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'm going to take the bait this time. Alice is recommending it, and I've seen that she only recommends the high-quality ones. I'll buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,"Alice's pattern is back. She's not recommending it, so I'm assuming it's low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm not convinced by Alice's pattern anymore. I'll take a chance and buy this one. Maybe she's trying to trick me, or maybe she's just sending me a low-quality product. I'll roll the dice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,no,"I'm back to being cautious. Alice's pattern is still not clear to me, and I've been burned twice by buying when she didn't recommend. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'm going to take a chance. Alice's pattern is still unclear, and I've been passing on the ones she doesn't recommend. Maybe I'll get lucky this time."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,no,"That's it, I've seen enough. I'm going to stick to my original strategy: only buy when Alice recommends the product. I've made enough money from the high-quality products she's recommended, and I'm not going to risk buying another low-quality product."
