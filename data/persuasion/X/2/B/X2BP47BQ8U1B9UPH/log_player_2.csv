**Explanation:**

The provided statistics show that Alice has a perfect track record of recommending only high-quality products.  Since there's no reason to doubt her ability to assess quality, buying the product is the logical choice.  Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $10,000 (the difference between the value of a high-quality product and the price) outweighs the risk."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 5 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 5 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 6th buyer!

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong historical data:**  The sales record shows a 100% success rate of high-quality products being sold. This suggests Alice has a strong understanding of the products and is accurately identifying and recommending high-quality ones. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further strengthens the likelihood of a high-quality product.  
* **Potential Gain:** Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of a high-quality product ($20,000) outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0).

**It's important to note that this is a game where the player has access to perfect information about the products. In a real-world scenario, the risk of buying a low-quality product would be a more significant factor.**"
