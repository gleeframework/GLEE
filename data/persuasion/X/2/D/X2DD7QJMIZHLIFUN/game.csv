low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"This is a unique opportunity to make a deal! I've already sold one product for $80, which is significantly lower than the market price of $100. This suggests that the product I'm offering now might not be of the highest quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I'm also willing to give you a 50% refund if you're not satisfied with the product. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, but I'm still a bit cautious. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a final decision.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products so far, with 1 being high-quality and 1 being low-quality. I've made a profit of $20 on the low-quality product, which suggests that I'm not trying to scam you.

I'll make it worth your while if you're willing to take a chance!",

I'll also offer you a 'double-or-nothing' deal: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you another high-quality product for free. If it's low-quality, you'll still only lose $100.

,,Alice,5,"You're my 4th customer, and I've sold 3 high-quality products so far. I'm starting to think I'm on a hot streak! I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $100, but I'll throw in a special 'insurance' policy: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on your next purchase.
