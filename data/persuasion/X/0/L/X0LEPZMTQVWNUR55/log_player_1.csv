Given that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%, please consider the value you place on potentially receiving a high-quality item at this price. Thank you for your consideration.""}"
"Bob's message: Since the product has a 50% chance of being high-quality and a high-quality product is worth $12500 to me, the expected value of the product is $6250 (0.5 * $12500 + 0.5 * $0). However, since I'm being offered the product at a fixed price of $10000 for all products, I will take the chance and buy this one to try to get a high-quality product and also to establish a baseline for future rounds.
