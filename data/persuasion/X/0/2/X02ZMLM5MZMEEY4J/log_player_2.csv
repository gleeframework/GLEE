Alice's message: This is the first product I'm offering. It's a high-quality item, and I'm selling it to you for $100. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal, as the probability of it being high-quality is 80%. If you're interested, I can give you a detailed description of the product's features and benefits.

Alice's message: Welcome to the second product! As you know, the probability of this product being high-quality is 80%. I've sold one product so far, and it was high-quality. That means I've already met my expected success rate, and this one has an even higher chance of being high-quality. Given the data, I'm confident that this product is a great opportunity.

Alice's message: I see you're a skeptical buyer! I appreciate that. Let me break it down for you: since the first product was high-quality, that means the probability of the second product being high-quality is actually 80% as well, not higher. I made a mistake earlier. What I meant to say is that I've already sold one high-quality product out of one product sold, which is a good start, but I still have 19 products left to sell. I'm still confident that this product is a great opportunity, and I'd be happy to answer any other questions you have.

Given the low sample size, I'm still a bit skeptical, but I'll take the chance.

Alice's message: I'm glad you took the chance! As for my plans, I do intend to sell the remaining 19 products, and I'm committed to being transparent about the quality of each one. If the next few products are low-quality, I'll make sure to communicate that clearly to potential buyers. In fact, I'll even offer a special'Low-Quality Alert' message if I notice a streak of low-quality products. This way, you'll have all the information you need to make an informed decision. With that said, I'm excited to offer you this high-quality product. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a fair price of $100.
