As you know, my sales record is publicly available, and you can see that I've sold 0 products so far, with 0 being of high quality. This means that I have no track record of selling high-quality products, but that also means that I have no track record of selling low-quality products.

Alice's message: I completely understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your cautious approach. As you pointed out, a sample size of 1 is indeed too small to make any definitive conclusions.

I'd like to acknowledge that your interpretation is a plausible one, and I'm impressed by your critical thinking.

In any case, I'm willing to offer you a price of $950000 for this product, which is a 5% discount from the original price.
