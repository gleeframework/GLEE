**Explanation:**

* **High Probability:** Even though there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the 80% chance of a high-quality product, coupled with Alice's recommendation and the previous successful sale, makes buying a worthwhile gamble.
* **Potential Profit:** If the product is high quality, the profit potential is significant ($2,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,000,000).
* **No Loss from Passing:** If it's low quality, the worst outcome is simply losing the $1,000,000. There's no additional penalty for passing. 

**Overall, the potential reward outweighs the risk, making it reasonable to purchase the product.**"

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, and since there is no reason to suspect Alice is untrustworthy, we should take her recommendation seriously.
* **Perfect track record:**  All 12 previous buyers who bought based on Alice's recommendations received high-quality products. This strongly suggests that Alice is either very accurate in her assessments or is intentionally only recommending high-quality products.
* **Expected value:**  Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of a high-quality product (worth $2,000,000) is significantly greater than the potential loss (worth $0). 

This scenario represents a high-risk, high-reward situation, but the data strongly suggests a positive outcome."
