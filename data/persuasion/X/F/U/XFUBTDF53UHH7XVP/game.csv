low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer, and I'll buy the product regardless of Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $10000. I'm aware that the odds are not in my favor, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, I'm not confident in the quality of the product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 2, which is 0%. This is consistent with the 50% chance of a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation. If I buy and it's low quality, I'd lose $10000. If I pass and it's high quality, I'd still miss out on a $20000 gain. However, if I pass and it's low quality, the product will be discarded, and I won't lose any money. I'd like to see the outcome of the next product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers also passed on the products after your recommendations, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. If it's low-quality, I'd like to pass."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the chances of this one being high quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyers didn't find the products valuable enough to purchase, and I'm not convinced by your recommendation."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm trying to make a rational decision based on the probabilities."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that you've recommended 4 other products to previous buyers and none of them were high quality. I'd like to wait for a more favorable recommendation or more information before making a purchase.

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not going to take the risk based on your past recommendations. I'd like to see more information about the products or the sales process before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm concerned that the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and they all passed on the high-quality products. This might indicate that the proportion of high-quality products is higher than 50%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data. Can you share the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it, which makes me think it's likely to be low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product so I can get it for $10000 instead of $0."
