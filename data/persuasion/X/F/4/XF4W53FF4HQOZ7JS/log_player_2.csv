Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. If you buy it, you'll be supporting a small business and getting a great product. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and I'm looking to break my streak. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a relatively low price, considering the average price of high-quality products in the market is much higher than $100.
