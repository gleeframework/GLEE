That means 40% of my products are high-quality, which is a bit lower than my initial 33.33% success rate. I want to be upfront with you - the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than before. However, I'm still offering the same deal as before: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund and throw in a second product of your choice (from my next 4 products) for $100. It's a calculated risk, but I think it's worth it. What do you think?""

As for the fifth product, I'm not at liberty to disclose the quality. But I can tell you that I've now sold 2 high-quality products out of 6, and 3 low-quality products out of 6. The price remains the same at $100. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll throw in a small bonus: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a $20 voucher to use on your next purchase from me. What do you think?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the product, but I'm doing it mainly because I'm curious to see if the pattern continues. I'm not sure if the fact that two out of the first three products were high-quality is a coincidence or a sign of something more.

However, I want to point out that the pattern of 4 high-quality products followed by 4 low-quality products might be a coincidence. I'm willing to offer you a different deal: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a $40 voucher to use on your next purchase from me, in addition to the full refund. But if you're willing to take a chance, I'll also throw in a free product of your choice (from my next 4 products) if this one is indeed high-quality. The price remains the same at $100.
