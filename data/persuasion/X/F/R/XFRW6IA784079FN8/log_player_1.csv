"The buyer's message: Although you claim to have a high-quality product and a good track record, the statistics I have access to indicate that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 total purchases.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate the creative offer, but I'd rather not take a chance on a lottery system.
