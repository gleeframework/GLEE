high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice has recommended two low-quality products so far, as none of them were sold for their true value of $125. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's high quality and will be worth $125 to me."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the products, I'm inclined to think that the products might be low-quality, which would align with the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy it and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the products recommended so far might be low-quality. I'd like to see if the next product is of higher quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that none of the previous buyers have bought a high-quality product. The proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, and since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm going to assume that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
