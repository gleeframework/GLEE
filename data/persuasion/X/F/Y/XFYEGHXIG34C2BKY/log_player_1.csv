However, I want to assure you that our products are randomly selected, and the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. We're offering this product to you for $1,000,000. Given the streak, do you think the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 21.43%?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not basing my decision solely on the sales record.

Given this new information, do you think the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 29.41%?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to point out that the sales record still underestimates the true probability of high-quality products. I'd like to consider the fact that 8 out of 9 buyers who passed on the product were offered a low-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products offered to buyers who passed is actually higher than the overall sales record.
