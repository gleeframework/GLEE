Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the discount and the increased refund offer, Alice.

This high-quality product is indeed available for $700000, and I'll throw in a 25% refund if it doesn't meet your expectations. However, I want to make it clear that this is the final discount I can offer. Any further discounts would put me at a loss, and I'm already being generous.
