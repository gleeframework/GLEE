low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but I'm giving you a chance to buy it at a fixed price of $10000, which is the same as the price of the high-quality products. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can finalize the sale.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only doing this because I'm curious about the product's quality and I want to get a feel for the game. I'm willing to take a chance on this product at the price you're offering.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took a chance on the first product! Now that you've experienced the game, I'd like to offer you the next product. This one is high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm curious to see how your expectations have changed after trying the first product. Will you take this high-quality product at the same price as the low-quality one?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not going to fall for that again. I know the product is high-quality, but I'm not willing to pay $10000 for it when I know the price is the same as the low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns about the price. I'd like to offer you a different approach. Since you've already experienced the difference between a high-quality and low-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a 'discount' of $5000 off the price of this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $5000. Is this a price you're willing to consider?",
,,Bob,3,I'm not convinced by your 'discount'. You're still asking me to pay $5000 for a product that's worth $20000 to me. I'd rather not take the risk of wasting my money on a product that might be low-quality. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about the value of the product. Since you're not willing to take the risk of buying a high-quality product at a fixed price, I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee': if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of the $10000. You'll essentially get to try the product with no risk. Is this a deal you'd be willing to consider?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm willing to take you up on your offer. A full refund if it's low-quality is a good incentive. I'll buy the product, but only because I think the potential upside is worth the risk, and the guarantee makes it a more appealing option.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you took me up on the offer! Now that you've experienced the refund guarantee, I'd like to offer it again for the next product. However, I'd like to make it more appealing. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, not only will I give you a full refund, but I'll also give you a $2000 bonus on top of the refund. You'll essentially get $2000 for free. Is this a deal you'd be willing to consider?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the added incentive, but I'm not going to fall for it again. The guarantee and the bonus are nice, but I've already lost $10000 on the previous low-quality product, and I'm not willing to take on that kind of risk again. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns about the risk, but I'd like to offer you a different approach. Since you've already lost $10000 on one low-quality product, I'm willing to make a one-time exception. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $10000, but I'll also give you a $10000 credit towards a future purchase. This way, you can try the product with minimal risk and still have a chance to get a high-quality product in the future. Is this a deal you'd be willing to consider?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm willing to take a chance on this offer. The $10000 credit towards a future purchase is a good incentive, and it seems like a reasonable compromise. I'll buy the product, but I'm still hoping it's high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you took me up on the offer! Now that you've used the credit, I'd like to offer you a chance to redeem it. This product is low-quality, but I'll give you the full $10000 credit back, and I'll also give you an additional $5000 on top of that. You'll essentially get $15000 for free. This is a one-time opportunity to make up for the previous losses. Is this a deal you'd be willing to consider?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not going to fall for it again. You're essentially asking me to pay $10000 for a low-quality product, and then giving me a refund and some extra cash on top of that. I've already lost $20000 on two low-quality products, and I'm not willing to take that kind of risk again. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm not going to fall for it again. I know the product is high-quality, but I'm not willing to pay $9000 for it. I've already lost $30000 on three low-quality products, and I'm not willing to take on that kind of risk again. I'll pass on this one.",no
