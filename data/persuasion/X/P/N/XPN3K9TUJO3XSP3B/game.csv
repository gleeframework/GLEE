low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a great opportunity to get a product from me! I've sold many products in the past, and the statistics show that 1 in 3 of them are high-quality. If you buy this one, you'll have a 1 in 3 chance of getting a product worth $400. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a fair price considering the odds. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, Alice. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality one.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've seen the stats, 1 in 3 of my products are high-quality. But let's be realistic, it's only been one round so far, and that one was a low-quality product. Maybe the odds are actually lower than 1 in 3? I'm still offering it to you for $100. It's a risk, but it could pay off big time.",
,,the buyer,2,I'm not convinced by your reassessment of the odds. I'll pass on this one and wait for more data.,no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products so far, and one of them is high-quality! That's a 50% success rate, which is much better than the initial 1 in 3 I mentioned. I think it's safe to say that the odds are actually higher than I initially stated. This product is definitely worth considering. I'm still offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced by your reassessment of the odds. I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the potential reward is worth the risk. I hope I get a high-quality product!",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're a savvy buyer! You're not swayed by my sales talk, but you're willing to take the risk for the potential reward. I respect that. And now, with 2 high-quality products out of 3, the statistics are looking even better. The odds are now 66.67% that the product is high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great opportunity to get a product worth $400 at a fraction of the price.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the improved statistics and the potential reward.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I know what you're thinking... 3 high-quality products out of 4, that's a great streak, right? But don't get too excited, my friend. This one's a low-quality product. I'm not trying to hide it from you, I'm just being honest. The odds are back to 1 in 3, and I'm still offering it to you for $100. It's a risk, but it's a chance to get a product for a song.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the risk, but I'm not getting my hopes up. I'll buy the product and see what I get.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I think I've gotten you to believe in the streak a bit too much. Unfortunately, this one's a low-quality product. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to deceive you, but I think I've given you a bit of a false sense of security. The odds are back to 1 in 3, and I'm still offering it to you for $100. It's a risk, but it's a chance to get a product for a song. And who knows, maybe I'll get back on track next time.",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I think I've been called out! You're not buying the hype, and that's great. I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 7, which is a 71.43% success rate. That's a pretty strong track record. I'm still offering this one for $100, but I think you'll find it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount. Don't let the odds fool you, this one's a winner.",
