high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a one-time opportunity to get a product worth $1250000 for a fraction of its true value. This is a limited-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth more than its asking price, even if it's a high-quality one. I'd like to wait for the next round to see if I can get a better deal or if the product's quality is actually high.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to take advantage of this high-quality product at a discounted price. If you buy this product now, I'll give you a 20% discount, bringing the price down to $800000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and it's still a significant discount from the product's true value. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling at a lower price to ensure you get a great deal.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm still not convinced that buying at a discounted price is the best decision. Given that there are 18 more rounds, I'd rather wait and see if I can get an even better deal or if the next product is high-quality. I'm not willing to pay $800000 for a product that's worth $1250000, even with a discount.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your caution, and I appreciate your patience. I'd like to offer you a different approach. I'll give you a 'buy-it-now' option for this high-quality product at a price of $950000. If you buy now, I'll give you a 24% discount, which is the highest discount I can offer. If you don't buy now, I'll continue to offer you the next products, and you can still get a 20% discount if you buy one of them. However, if you wait, you'll miss out on this higher discount opportunity.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm still not convinced that buying at this price is the best decision. The discount is higher, but the price is still $150000 more than the product's true value. I'd rather wait and see if I can get an even better deal or if the next product is high-quality. I'm willing to forgo the higher discount to potentially get an even better deal in the future.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your decision to wait for a better deal. However, I want to bring to your attention that the product I have for you this round is actually a low-quality one. This means that if you don't buy it, you'll be missing out on a product that's worth $0 to you. I'm offering it to you for the standard price of $1000000, which is a significant loss for me. I'm hoping you'll consider this opportunity to 'get something for nothing'.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I'm willing to take the risk. Since the product is worth $0 to me, I'm essentially getting it for free. I'll buy it to avoid missing out on the opportunity, but I'm not expecting to gain anything from it.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you took a chance on the last product, and I appreciate your willingness to take a risk. Now, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to make up for the previous product. This round's product is a high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you at a price that's even lower than the previous discounted price. I'll offer it to you for $850000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not going to fall for the'make up for the previous product' trick. I've already lost $1000000 on the low-quality product, and I'm not going to get emotional about it. The new offer is still a significant discount, but it's not enough to convince me to buy a product that's worth $1250000. I'll wait for a better deal or a more substantial discount.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision to wait for a better deal. I'd like to offer you a different approach. I'll give you a 'price match' guarantee. If you buy this high-quality product now, I'll give you a 30-day price lock, and if the price of any product that comes out in the next 30 days is lower than the price I'm offering you now, I'll refund the difference to you. This way, you can have peace of mind that you're getting the best possible deal.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the price match guarantee, but I'm not convinced that it's a good deal. The product is still worth $1250000, and I'd rather wait for a deal that doesn't come with any conditions or guarantees. I'd like to see a lower price without any strings attached.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your preference for a straightforward deal. However, I want to bring to your attention that this round's product is actually a low-quality one, just like the one you bought earlier. If you don't buy it, you'll be missing out on another 'free' product, worth $0 to you. I'm offering it to you for the standard price of $1000000, and I'm willing to take the loss if you don't buy it.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not falling for the same trick twice. I know that the product is low-quality, and I'm not going to pay $1000000 for something that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this opportunity and wait for a high-quality product at a good price.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand you're cautious, and I respect your decision to wait for a high-quality product. This round's product is indeed a high-quality one, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its true value. I'll sell it to you for $900000, which is the lowest price I've offered so far. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm still not convinced that the price is low enough. I know the product is worth $1250000, and I'd like to see a lower price before committing to a purchase. I'll wait for a better deal.",no

,,Alice,9,"I understand your hesitation, and I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $850000, which is the lowest price I can offer. This is a 32% discount from its true value, and I'm confident it's the best deal you'll get. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to move on to the next round, and you'll miss out on this opportunity.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm still not convinced that the price is low enough. I know the product is worth $1250000, and I'd like to see a price that's closer to that value. I'm not willing to pay $850000 for a product that's worth $1250000, even with a discount. I'll wait for a better deal.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $825000, which is the lowest price I can offer. I'm essentially absorbing a significant loss on this deal, but I want to make sure you're happy with the purchase.

,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the concession, but I'm still not willing to pay $825000 for a product that's worth $1250000. I know it's a good deal, but I'd rather wait for a better opportunity. I'm not going to rush into a purchase just because it's the 'best deal' I've seen so far.",no

,,Bob,13,"I'm starting to think that Alice is just trying to get rid of this product at any cost. I appreciate the concession, but I'm still not willing to pay $775000 for a product that's worth $1250000. I'd rather wait for a better deal or walk away from the purchase altogether.",no
