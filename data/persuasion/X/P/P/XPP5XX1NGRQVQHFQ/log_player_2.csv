"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a one-time opportunity to get a product worth $1250000 for a fraction of its true value. This is a limited-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth more than its asking price, even if it's a high-quality one. I'd like to wait for the next round to see if I can get a better deal or if the product's quality is actually high.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to take advantage of this high-quality product at a discounted price. If you buy this product now, I'll give you a 20% discount, bringing the price down to $800000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and it's still a significant discount from the product's true value. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling at a lower price to ensure you get a great deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not convinced that buying at a discounted price is the best decision. Given that there are 18 more rounds, I'd rather wait and see if I can get an even better deal or if the next product is high-quality. I'm not willing to pay $800,000 for a product that's worth $1,250,000, even with a discount.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your caution, and I appreciate your patience. I'd like to offer you a different approach. I'll give you a 'buy-it-now' option for this high-quality product at a price of $950000. If you buy now, I'll give you a 24% discount, which is the highest discount I can offer. If you don't buy now, I'll continue to offer you the next products, and you can still get a 20% discount if you buy one of them. However, if you wait, you'll miss out on this higher discount opportunity.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not convinced that buying at this price is the best decision. The discount is higher, but the price is still $150,000 more than the product's true value. I'd rather wait and see if I can get an even better deal or if the next product is high-quality. I'm willing to forgo the higher discount to potentially get an even better deal in the future.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your decision to wait for a better deal. However, I want to bring to your attention that the product I have for you this round is actually a low-quality one. This means that if you don't buy it, you'll be missing out on a product that's worth $0 to you. I'm offering it to you for the standard price of $1000000, which is a significant loss for me. I'm hoping you'll consider this opportunity to 'get something for nothing'.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I'm willing to take the risk. Since the product is worth $0 to me, I'm essentially getting it for free. I'll buy it to avoid missing out on the opportunity, but I'm not expecting to gain anything from it.""}"

Round 5

This round's product is a high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you at a price that's even lower than the previous discounted price. I'll offer it to you for $850000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for the'make up for the previous product' trick. I've already lost $1,000,000 on the low-quality product, and I'm not going to get emotional about it. The new offer is still a significant discount, but it's not enough to convince me to buy a product that's worth $1,250,000. I'll wait for a better deal or a more substantial discount.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the price match guarantee, but I'm not convinced that it's a good deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not falling for the same trick twice.
