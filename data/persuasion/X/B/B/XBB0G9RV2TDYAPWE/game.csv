,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd rather wait to see the outcome of the first sale to get a better sense of the product's quality distribution."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or your own biases, so I'll take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because Alice didn't recommend it, not because I have any information that suggests it's a high-quality product. I'm hoping to get lucky!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,

,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious about the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, and you're concerned that this product might be low-quality as well?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, but since Alice doesn't recommend it, I'll pass on it to see if the next buyer will make a better decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the probability of it being low quality is high and the probability of it being high quality is low, given the previous sales record. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your recommendation doesn't affect my decision, but I'd like to understand your thought process behind it. Can you tell me what led you to not recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy it, given your previous recommendations were not good indicators of quality. The fact that 5 previous buyers bought and no high-quality products were sold suggests the products sold so far were low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get it for the fixed price of $100. I'm aware that the previous 5 buyers have all passed on the product, and I'm wondering if this might be a high-quality product that's been hidden so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product, Alice. Is it because of the statistics so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers did not buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that all previous products were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it seems likely that this product is also low-quality. I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your decision-making process?

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious, Alice. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. Can you tell me more about the product's quality?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're recommending it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
