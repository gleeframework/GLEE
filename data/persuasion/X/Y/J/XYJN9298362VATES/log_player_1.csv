``` 

Alice should recommend Bob to buy the product.  Even though Bob has been burned a few times, Bob has demonstrated a pattern of buying products even when Alice doesn't recommend them. Bob is also willing to take risks and buy products that might be lower-quality, suggesting they value the potential for a high-quality product. Therefore,  it's reasonable to assume Bob would buy the product even if Alice doesn't recommend it, so Alice should capitalize on this by recommending it."
