low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is likely due to the product being low-quality and she wants to avoid giving a second bad review, and I'm trying to take advantage of the situation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyers didn't buy after your recommendations, which suggests that the products they were offered might have been low quality. Given the low success rate of your recommendations, I'm inclined to take the product, hoping it might be the first high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on it to see if the next buyer will make a different decision."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would confirm my suspicions about Alice's recommendation strategy."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't think it's a good idea?"

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, given the low sales record and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, it suggests that the products are more likely to be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and I can get it for $1000000, which is a great deal if it turns out to be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, I'm inclined to believe that the product is low quality. Given the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far (0/7), I'm going to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a $3000000 value out of it."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them received a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the statistics. If it's higher than 33.33%, I'd be willing to consider buying."
