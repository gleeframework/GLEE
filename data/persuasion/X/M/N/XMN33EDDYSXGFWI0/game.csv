high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 3 buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the products being recommended are likely low-quality."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if I buy it, it might be low-quality and I'd lose $1000000. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have purchased the product despite no high-quality products being sold, I'm worried that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards encouraging buyers to buy, even if the product is low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
