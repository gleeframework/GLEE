"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a great opportunity to get a product at a discounted price of $100, which is 0% of the product's true value. I'm willing to sell it to you for this price, but I need your confirmation to finalize the deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for this. I'll pass on this product.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism from the previous round, but I assure you that this product is a one-time offer. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on a unique opportunity. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a fair price considering the product's... let's just say, 'character'.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this product is any better than the last one. I'll pass on this one too.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I see you're being cautious, and I respect that. Let me ask you this: would you rather have a 0% chance of getting a high-quality product at $100, or a 0% chance of getting a high-quality product at $0? The price remains the same, but the potential upside is clear. This is your chance to take a calculated risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to pay $100 for a product that has a 0% chance of being high-quality. You're just trying to convince me to buy a low-quality product at a high price.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm not trying to deceive you. Let's focus on the facts: I'm offering you a product at $100, which is the price I've been offering all along. You've had the chance to pass on the previous products, and now you're being presented with another opportunity. I'm not going to change the price or the terms. It's a straightforward transaction: $100 for a product that may or may not be high-quality. Your call.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for the same old pitch. I'll pass on this one too.""}"

Round 5
Alice's message: I'm starting to think you're not taking me seriously. Let me ask you a question: if you were to buy this product, and it turned out to be high-quality, would you regret not taking the chance? The price is still $100, and the potential reward is still there. I'm not asking you to take a risk, I'm asking you to consider the possibility of a reward.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to take a chance on a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless. The potential reward isn't worth the risk.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I see you're doing some math, and I respect that. However, I'd like to clarify that the probability you're thinking of is actually 66.67% chance of NOT being high-quality, which means there's a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. I'm not trying to confuse you, but I want to make sure you have the correct information. The price remains the same, and the potential reward is still there.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the clarification, but it doesn't change my decision. The probability of it being high-quality is still too low for me to consider paying $100.""}"

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand your decision, but I'd like to offer you a compromise. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount, making the price $90. This way, you'll be taking on less risk, and you'll still have the potential to get a high-quality product at a lower cost. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""A 10% discount doesn't change the fact that I still have a 66.67% chance of getting a worthless product. I'm not willing to pay $90 for a product that may not be worth anything to me.""}"

But I'll let you in on a little secret: you got a great deal on the last one, and you should consider yourself lucky. This one, on the other hand, is a bit of a gamble. Would you like to take the chance and buy it for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for it again. I know the odds are against me, and I'm not going to pay $100 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless.""}"
