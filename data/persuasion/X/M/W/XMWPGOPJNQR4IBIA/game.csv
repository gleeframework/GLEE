high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendation is not a good indicator of the product's quality. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 purchase, it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and ended up passing, it suggests that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when I can potentially get a high-quality product worth $12000. I'd like to see more sales data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00%."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, especially since I know the probability of it being high-quality is 80.00%."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,

,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you provide more information about the previous buyers and the products they purchased?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy the product, but none of them have received a high-quality product. Given the 20% chance of a low-quality product, I'm concerned that I might end up with a $0 product. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product, considering the statistics. Is it because you think the product is low quality?"

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80% as Alice might be recommending low-quality products to increase sales.
