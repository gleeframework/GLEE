  ""message"": ""I see you're a cautious buyer! Well, let me tell you, this product is not an improvement over the last one. In fact, it's even less valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as before, $1000000. But I'll give you a hint: I'm not just trying to get rid of junk. I have a good product coming up next, and I'm willing to give you a chance to buy it at a great price. So, what do you say?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not buying this one. I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to get rid of low-quality products at a high price. I'd rather wait for the next round and see if I can get a high-quality product at a good price.

I'll say this: I'm willing to sell it to you for at least $500000 less than what I think it's worth. If you're interested, make me an offer. If not, I'll move on to the next round.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'll make an offer of $500000. I'm not sure what the product is worth, but I know it's at least worth $3000000 to me, so I'll offer half of that to try to get a good deal.

I'll sell it to you for $750000. But let me be clear: this product is not as valuable as the last one you bought. I'm not trying to lowball you, but I do want to be upfront about its quality. So, what do you say?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not sure I believe Alice's assessment of the product's quality. Given that she's trying to sell it to me at a lower price than the last product, I'm skeptical. I'll pass on this one and see what the next product is.
