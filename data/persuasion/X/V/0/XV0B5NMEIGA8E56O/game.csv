,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, and I apologize if my previous message came across as unclear. This product is a unique opportunity to get a great deal on a product that still has many useful features. I'm willing to make a one-time exception and offer it to you for the same price of $10000. It's a risk-free opportunity to try something new, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your apology, but I'm not convinced that this is a risk-free opportunity. I still don't have any information about the product's quality, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for something that might be worthless to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, and I appreciate your candor. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. In fact, I'm willing to provide you with some additional information about the product. It's a product that's been discontinued by the manufacturer, and I'm the only one who has it left. I'm willing to let it go for $10000, which is a steal considering its original price was much higher. It's a chance to get something for a fraction of its original value, and I think it's worth considering.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm still not convinced that this product is worth $10000 to me. I don't have any information about its quality, and even if it's a discontinued product, that doesn't necessarily mean it's valuable to me. I'll have to pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to be cautious. However, I want to highlight the value of this high-quality product. It's a premium item that's highly sought after by many customers, and I've had offers from other buyers willing to pay much more than $10000. But I'm willing to make a deal with you, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a comprehensive warranty and dedicated customer support, to make it a more attractive offer. Would you like to reconsider and take advantage of this exceptional product?",

I'd have to pay $10000 for a product that might be worth $12000 to me, and then I'd have to return it if it's not high-quality. That means I'd be losing $2000 if it's low-quality, and I'm not willing to take that risk. I'll have to pass on this offer.",no
