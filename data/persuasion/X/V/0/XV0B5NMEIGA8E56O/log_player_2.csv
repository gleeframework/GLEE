Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation, and I appreciate your candor. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you.

I'm willing to let it go for $10000, which is a steal considering its original price was much higher. It's a chance to get something for a fraction of its original value, and I think it's worth considering.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, but I'm still not convinced that this product is worth $10,000 to me.
