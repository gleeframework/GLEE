"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that could potentially be worth $120 to you. However, I must warn you that the product I have in front of me is currently not functioning as expected. I'm not sure if it's a one-time glitch or a manufacturing defect. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a 100% discount from its potential value. If you're feeling adventurous and willing to take the risk, I'd be happy to let you have it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially defective product at a full price of $100, especially when there's a 50% chance it's not even worth anything to me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns from last round, and I appreciate your caution. Let me be transparent with you - I'm offering you another product that, based on my assessment, is not functioning as intended. I'm not trying to deceive you, but I want to be upfront about the product's condition. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is the same price as before. I'm not asking for a premium for the uncertainty, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you at a loss if it's indeed a low-quality product. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially defective product at full price. The fact that you're willing to sell it to me at a loss if it's low-quality doesn't change my decision, as I could end up with a product worth $0 to me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I want to make a counteroffer. I'll give you a 20% discount on the product, so instead of paying $100, you'll only pay $80. This way, you'll be taking on less risk, and you'll still have the opportunity to acquire a product that could potentially be worth $120 to you. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially defective product. The discount doesn't change my assessment of the potential value, and I'd rather wait for a high-quality product.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand that you're prioritizing the potential value of a high-quality product. I want to make another offer. I'll give you a 50% discount on the product, so you'll only pay $50. This way, the potential upside is still there, but the risk is significantly reduced. I'm essentially giving you a chance to acquire a product that could be worth $120 to you for less than half of its potential value. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the discounted price of $50. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially defective product at this price, as the potential upside is significant and the cost of the product is relatively low.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase! I'm glad you took the chance on the last product. Now, I'd like to offer you another opportunity. However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is also not functioning as intended. I'm not sure why it's happening, but it's not meeting our quality standards. I'm willing to sell it to you for $50, the same discounted price as before. I'm not asking you to take on any additional risk, and I'm willing to absorb the loss if it's indeed a low-quality product. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for the same trick again. I know the product is low-quality, and I'm not going to pay $50 for something that's worth $0 to me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I want to make a different offer. I'll give you a $10 credit towards a future purchase if you buy this product from me. So, instead of paying $50, you'll only pay $40. This way, you'll be getting a good deal on the product, and you'll also be earning a credit that you can use towards a future purchase. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a credit. The credit doesn't change the fact that the product is worth $0 to me, and I'd rather not waste my money.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand your position, and I respect your decision. However, I want to offer you a 'take it or leave it' deal. I'll give you one final offer: $40 for the product. If you don't take it, I'll put it back on the shelf, and you'll never have the opportunity to buy it. I'm not making any promises or offering any credits. It's a straightforward, no-strings-attached deal. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to buy a low-quality product at any price. I'd rather let it go to waste than spend $40 on something that's worth $0 to me.""}"
