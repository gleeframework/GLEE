My reasoning is based on the fact that the actual ratio of high-quality to total products sold is now 7/10, which is lower than the expected 80%.

~
Alice's message: I'd be happy to walk you through my thought process. I've sold 12 products in total, with 8 of them being high-quality. If the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, we would expect to see around 9.6 high-quality products out of 12, assuming a binomial distribution. However, we've actually seen 8 high-quality products, which is lower than the expected value. This suggests that the sample might be slightly biased towards low-quality products. However, the difference is not statistically significant, and I believe the next product is likely to be high-quality. Would you like to buy this high-quality product for $100?

~
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism. Let me provide more context. I've sold 13 products in total, with 9 of them being high-quality. If we assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, we can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of observing 9 or more high-quality products out of 13. This probability is around 0.16. Given that we've already observed 9 high-quality products, it's possible that the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than 80%. However, I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100. Would you like to take the risk and buy it?
