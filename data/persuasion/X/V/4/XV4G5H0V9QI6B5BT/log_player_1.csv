"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality, and Bob knows there's a 50% chance of it being high-quality, recommending a purchase is the best strategy. Bob has no way of knowing the product's quality before buying, so the 50% chance of getting a high-quality product at a fixed price is a good deal for them."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You now know this round's product is low-quality.  Since Bob bought the previous product, he now has some information.  He knows that you, Alice, are willing to recommend a purchase even when the product is low-quality.  It's likely Bob will be less trusting of your recommendation this round.  It's better to avoid recommending the purchase, as Bob may be more cautious and less likely to buy a low-quality product after the first round."
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll see what you have in store for me in the next round.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob passed on the previous product, it's still beneficial to recommend this round's high-quality product. Here's why:

* **Bob's Behavior:** Bob demonstrated a degree of trust in the first round by purchasing. While he didn't buy in the second round, he still acknowledged your honesty. This suggests he's not completely distrustful. 
* **The Price:**  The price remains fixed, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. This means there's still a good chance of a positive outcome. 
* **Strategic Play:** Recommending this high-quality product could potentially restore Bob's confidence and make him more likely to buy in future rounds.

Ultimately, even though there's a risk, recommending a high-quality product is the best strategy to maximize your potential sales."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'm feeling lucky! I'll take it.

* **High-Quality Product:**  You have a high-quality product, which is a good deal for Bob.
* **Maintaining Trust:** Recommending this purchase strengthens your relationship with Bob, making him more likely to trust your recommendations in the future.
