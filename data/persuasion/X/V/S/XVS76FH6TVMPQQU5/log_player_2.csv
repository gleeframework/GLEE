Alice's message: I see you're thinking strategically! Let me provide some context: 2 out of the first 3 buyers passed on the product, and now you're the 4th buyer. This means the product has been passed on by 2/4 = 50% of buyers. Given the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and assuming the quality of the product is independent of the buyer's preference, the probability of this product being low-quality is 20%. However, since the product is actually high-quality, you can infer that the probability of a product being high-quality given that it was passed on is higher than 80%.
