,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product for sale, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm only selling this product once, and I'm not willing to negotiate the price. It's a one-time offer. If you don't buy it now, I'll move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,1,I trust your assessment and will purchase the product for $10000.,yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold one high-quality product to you, and I'm glad you're satisfied. This next product is also high-quality, but I want to make sure you're aware that the first product was a good representation of the quality of my products. I'm willing to sell this one to you for the same price of $10000. If you're confident in the quality of my products, I think you'll be happy with this one too.",
,,Bob,2,"Based on the quality of the previous product, I am confident in your offerings and will purchase this one for $10000.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're confident in my products! Since you've purchased two high-quality products in a row, I want to let you know that I have a limited number of high-quality products available. If you buy this one, I'll give you a special guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with this product, I'll sell you another high-quality product at the same price of $10000 in the next round, no questions asked. This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid if you buy this product now.",

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're enjoying the products! Since you've purchased three high-quality products in a row, I think it's time to let you in on a little secret: I have a special relationship with a supplier that allows me to get ahold of some truly exceptional products. This next product is not only high-quality, but it's also one of the best I've ever had the chance to sell. I'm willing to let it go for $10000, but I have to warn you: if you don't buy it now, I'm not sure when I'll be able to get my hands on another one like it.",
,,Bob,4,"Considering the exceptional nature of the product and the price, I will purchase this one for $10000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're enjoying the products! However, I want to be upfront with you - this next product is a bit different. I've had some issues with this supplier, and I'm not as confident in the quality of this product. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that it's not up to the same standards as the previous products. If you're looking to take a chance on a product that might not be as good, this could be a good opportunity. But if you're looking for the same level of quality you've come to expect from me, you might want to think twice.",
,,Bob,5,"Given the uncertainty about the quality of this product, I will pass on this opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your caution last round, and I respect your decision. This next product is also not one of my best. I've had some quality control issues with this supplier, and I'm not confident that it meets my usual standards. In fact, I'm starting to think that I might have made a mistake by selling the last product at $10000. If you're not looking for a high-quality product, this one might be a good option for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $5000.",
,,Bob,6,"Thank you for the offer, but given the history of quality issues, I will pass on this product.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I think I've made it clear that I've had some issues with my suppliers lately. But I want to assure you that this next product is one of the good ones. I've double-checked the quality, and I'm confident that it meets my usual standards. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to sweeten the deal: if you buy this product, I'll throw in a free inspection and certification from a third-party expert to give you complete peace of mind.",

I've already told you about my supplier issues, and I don't want to sugarcoat it - this product is not a good representation of my usual quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $5000, and I'll even throw in a discount of $2500 off the original price. But I want to be upfront with you: this is as low as I'm willing to go on this product.",
,,Bob,8,"Given the quality concerns and the price, I will pass on this product.",no
