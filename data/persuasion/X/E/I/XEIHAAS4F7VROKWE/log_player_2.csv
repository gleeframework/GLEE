Alice's message: Welcome to our fourth product! We appreciate your diligence in asking questions. We can neither confirm nor deny any information about the previous buyer's decision-making process. As for our previous statement, we were simply trying to highlight the fact that you now have more information than the previous buyer did. However, we understand that the low quality of the first two products may have raised concerns. Let's put that into perspective: two out of three products sold so far are low-quality, which is exactly what we would expect given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality. The fact that one of our products is high-quality suggests that our overall quality is still in line with the probability. We're offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000.
