low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low-quality product rate is higher than expected, and I'll get a low-quality product, which is worthless to me, but it will also mean that the probability of a high-quality product remaining will increase for the next buyer."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I'm suspicious that all the products sold so far are low-quality. If I buy, I'll be overpaying $100 for a product worth $0 to me."
