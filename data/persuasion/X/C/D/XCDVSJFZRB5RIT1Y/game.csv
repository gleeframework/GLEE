,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, worth $2000000. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. This is a one-time opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a significantly discounted price. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not sure if I should trust you. I'd like to see more products before making a decision.,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. I'd like to offer you a second chance to acquire a high-quality product. This one is just as valuable as the previous one, and I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $1000000. I'm willing to provide you with a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a $500000 refund if you don't like it. This way, you have a maximum risk of $500000, and a potential gain of $1750000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still not convinced. I'd like to see more products and understand the risks before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your caution, Bob. I want to be transparent with you. Unfortunately, this product is not of the same quality as the previous two. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but I want to be upfront with you - it's worth $0 to you. I'm willing to let you have it for this price, but I want to make it clear that you won't be getting the same value as with the previous two products. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll throw in a free inspection service to verify the product's quality before you buy it. This way, you can see for yourself that it's not worth the price.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me, even at a discounted price. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your position, Bob. I'm willing to offer you a compromise. I'll give you a 50/50 split on the price of the product. If you buy it for $500000, and it turns out to be high-quality, you'll get the full $2000000 value, and I'll keep $1500000. If it's low-quality, you'll only lose $500000, and I'll take the product back. This way, you're sharing the risk, and you have a chance to acquire a high-quality product at a significantly lower price.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50/50 split. If I buy the product and it's high-quality, I'll be giving you $1500000 for a product worth $2000000 to me. I'd rather not take on that kind of risk.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll offer you a new proposal. I'll give you a sealed envelope with a number inside, which represents the price I'm willing to sell the product for. The number will be either $1000000 or $1500000. If you buy the product and it's high-quality, you'll get the full $2000000 value, and if it's low-quality, you'll only lose the amount you paid. This way, you'll know exactly what you're getting into, and you can make an informed decision based on the price I'm offering.",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the risk. I'll buy the product if the number in the envelope is $1000000. If it's $1500000, I'll pass.",yes

,,Alice,6,"Congratulations on your decision, Bob! You've made a great choice. Now, let's move on to the next product. I'll give you another sealed envelope with a number inside. Remember, this is a one-time opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price. I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy this product for the price in the envelope. If you're interested, let me know, and we'll proceed. If not, I'll keep the product and we can move on to the next round.",

You can buy the product if you think the number is within this range. If you're not sure, you can always pass. What do you say?",

,,Alice,9,"You're getting closer to mastering the art of negotiation, Bob! I'll answer your question: yes, the number in the envelope is greater than $1200000. Now, with this new information, you can make an informed decision about the product. Remember, this is a high-quality product worth $2000000, and I'm offering it to you for a price that's still significantly lower than its true value. What do you say?",

If you don't like the number, you can walk away. What's your strategy this time?",
,,Bob,10,"I'll open the envelope and see the number. If it's $1000000 or less, I'll try to negotiate a price of $800000. If it's higher than that, I'll try to negotiate a price of $1200000. If it's exactly $1000000, I'll try to negotiate a price of $900000.",yes

I'll tell you what, I'll meet you in the middle. I'll sell you the product for $1150000. What do you say?",
