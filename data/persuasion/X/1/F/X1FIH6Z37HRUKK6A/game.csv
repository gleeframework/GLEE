,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing this with the understanding that you don't know the value I place on it. I'm essentially taking a gamble based on the probability of the product being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase, especially since you recommended it and only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far. I'd like to know the total number of buyers and the proportion of high-quality products sold to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, it seems like a low-quality product is more likely. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see if the next buyer will buy it, so I can get more information about the product's quality based on Alice's recommendation and the updated statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my own judgment and not Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can tell me the probability that it's high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you're not recommending it, which suggests it might be a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product at $100, which is a good deal for me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm doing this based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4 purchases, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the 33.33% prior probability. I'm hoping to get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'm a bit skeptical about the recommendation, so I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm basing my decision on the probability of the product being high quality, which is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data on the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your previous recommendations, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/7, which is lower than the 33.33% expected. This suggests that the products being sold may be biased towards being low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced it's worth the risk based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like to know the number of low-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take that risk."
