low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, since there's no data to go by. I'll just have to rely on the probability of a high-quality product being sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being low quality is high and the previous buyer's decision might have been influenced by the recommendation, not the actual quality of the product. I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry here."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not sure about the product's quality, but with 2 low-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of this product being high-quality seems low. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, it suggests that the products Alice is offering are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as Alice's recommendation suggests it might be low quality and I don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is there any information that led you to advise against buying this product?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that Alice has recommended two products so far, and neither of them was high-quality. This suggests that Alice may be biased towards recommending products that are more likely to be low-quality, which is 66.67% of the products. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from Alice that is more aligned with the true probability of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of your recommendations so far, but I'd like to form my own opinion."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced it's high-quality based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, it suggests that the products sold so far have been low-quality. I'm inclined to believe that this product is also low-quality, and buying it would not be worth $100 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount. I'm aware that your previous recommendations haven't been very accurate, and I'm willing to take the risk. Can we discuss a possible discount?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality, but since 7 out of 7 previous buyers didn't buy it, and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that it's worth the risk of buying a low-quality product, especially since I know that 7 out of 7 previous products were low-quality."
