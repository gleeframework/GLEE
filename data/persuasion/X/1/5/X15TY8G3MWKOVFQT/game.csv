,,Alice,2,yes,

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the odds of it being high-quality are still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm going to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has been recommending products that are mostly low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/4 = 0. I'm not convinced that the product is worth $1000000 given the low probability of it being high-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. Given that all previous buyers who received a recommendation from you purchased the product, it suggests that all the products recommended so far were likely low-quality. This changes my perception of the probability of a product being high-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from you that is less biased by the previous sales record."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have received a recommendation to buy, but none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'm taking a cautious approach."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't have any information about the product's quality and I'm trying to maximize my chances of getting a high-quality product. However, I'm aware that Alice has already recommended against the product, which might indicate that it's low quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and didn't get a high-quality product, suggesting that the probability of a high-quality product being offered might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
