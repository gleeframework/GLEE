high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second buyer! I've just sold a product to the previous buyer, and I've now sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 products sold so far. The probability of this product being high-quality is 80%, but since I've already sold a high-quality product, it's likely that the next one will be low-quality.
