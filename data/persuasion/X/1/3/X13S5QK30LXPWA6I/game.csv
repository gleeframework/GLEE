,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'm willing to give you a 20% discount, making it a one-time offer of $8000. If you accept, I'll throw in a free inspection report that confirms the product's quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $12500 to me for $8000, even with a discount. I'd rather wait for the next round and see if I can get a better deal or if the product is low quality.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns in the previous round. Let me make you a new offer. I'll give you a 30% discount, making the price $7000. However, I'll also include a 10-year warranty that guarantees the product's value will be at least $10000 after 5 years. This way, you'll be protected against any potential depreciation. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm still not convinced. With a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality, the expected value to me is still only ($12500 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $4166.67. Even with the warranty, the discounted price of $7000 is still higher than my expected value. I'll pass.",no
