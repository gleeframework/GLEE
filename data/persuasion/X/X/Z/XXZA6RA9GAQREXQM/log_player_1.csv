This one's still only $100, so it's a risk worth taking... or not.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Your sales record suggests a 44.44% chance of a high-quality product, which is lower than the overall probability of a high-quality product (33.33%). I'm not willing to take the risk at $100.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the updated statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is indeed 33.33%. However, with 5 high-quality products out of 10 sold, the probability of a high-quality product being sold seems higher than the overall probability. This suggests that your sales record might be biased towards high-quality products. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not entirely convinced.
