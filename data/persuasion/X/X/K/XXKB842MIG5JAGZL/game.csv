high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 products, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,

,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. Since only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0.5 or 50%. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the probability of the current product being high-quality is less than 80%. I'll take the risk and buy the product."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase. The current statistics are not convincing enough for me to buy a product with a 20% chance of being low quality."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4, I can infer that the probability of a product being high-quality is 1/4. However, the probability of a product being low-quality is 3/4. Based on Alice's recommendation, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she only knows the outcome of the previous buyers, and I'm not sure if she's aware of the probability of high-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
