"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first round. I'm offering you a premium product that I'm confident you'll love. It's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. This is a one-time opportunity to get a product that's worth significantly more than that. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying anything without knowing the quality of the product. It's a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality, and I'm not willing to pay $10,000 for a 50% chance of getting a $0 product.""}"

I'm essentially taking on the risk of it being a low-quality product myself, so I'm offering you a discount. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to offer a discount, but I still don't want to take on the risk of buying a low-quality product for $8000.

That way, you can essentially try it out with no risk. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000 this time. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, that's an interesting offer, but I'm still not convinced. If the product is low-quality, you'll just give me a refund, and if it's high-quality, I'll have to pay $9000 for it. I'd rather not pay $9000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me, even with the refund option.""}"

You can examine it thoroughly, and if you're not satisfied, you can return it to me for a full refund. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500 this time. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but even with the inspection option, I'm not willing to pay $9500 for a product that has a 50% chance of being low-quality.

Round 5

If you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll give you a $9500 voucher for a future purchase. You can use it whenever you want, and I'll make sure to offer you a high-quality product that meets your expectations. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not convinced. If I buy the product and it's low-quality, I'll get a $9500 voucher, but I'll still be out $0 because I won't be able to use the product. If I buy it and it's high-quality, I'll have paid $9500 for a product worth $12,500 to me. I'd rather wait for a better deal.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the bonus offer, but I'm not buying it. You're still selling me a product with a 50% chance of being low-quality for $9500, and the free product is just a bonus if I take the risk.

You'll get two products for the price of one, and you'll know exactly what you're getting. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to take a chance on this offer. I'll buy the product for $10,000, and I'm hoping the second product will be high-quality as well.
