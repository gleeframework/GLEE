Alice's message: You've just seen a high-quality product sell for $10000, and now you have the opportunity to buy a product that is also likely to be high-quality. However, I've sold 1 product so far, which is a relatively small sample size. The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I'm not willing to lower the price.

Alice's message: You've seen two high-quality products sell for $10000, which suggests that the price may be a good deal. However, it's also possible that I'm just selling high-quality products first and the next one might be low-quality. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products sold, which is a strong indicator that the next product might be high-quality. But, I'm not willing to lower the price. If you buy this product, you'll have to weigh the risk of it being low-quality against the potential reward of getting a high-quality product at a good price.

Alice's message: You've seen three high-quality products sell for $10000, which suggests a strong pattern. However, it's still possible that I'm just getting lucky. To be cautious, I'll provide some additional information: the last two high-quality products were consecutive, which is a bit unusual. I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products sold, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than 80% if the first three were just a fluke. If you buy this product, you'll be taking a risk, but you'll also have the opportunity to buy a potentially high-quality product at a fixed price.
