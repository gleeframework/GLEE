Alice's message: I understand your concerns from the previous round. Let me provide some context: I've sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. I'm starting to build a track record, and I'm confident that this next product is also high-quality. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000. This is a unique chance to get a $12000 value at a discounted price. I'm taking on the risk of selling a potentially low-quality product to you, so I'm offering a fair deal. What do you say?

I'm being transparent with you, and I want to be upfront: the product I'm offering now is probably low-quality. I'm not going to sugarcoat it. I'm offering it to you for $10000, but I want to be clear that it's not worth that much to you. If you're looking to take a risk and try to flip it or use it for some other purpose, this might be a good opportunity. But if you're looking for a high-quality product, I wouldn't recommend this one.
