"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I will pass on this product.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll buy this product!""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is a significant change in Alice's behavior. She has never recommended a product before. Since Alice knows the true value of each product and is likely trying to avoid recommending low-quality products, this recommendation is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality. The potential gain of $1,000,000 (the difference between the product's value to you and Alice's price) outweighs the risk of it being low-quality."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!

Alice's recommendation pattern is now established. She only recommends products when she knows they are high quality.  The potential profit of $1,000,000 makes this a very attractive offer, and the risk is mitigated by Alice's consistent recommendation behavior."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.
