high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, as there's no prior data to influence my decision"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0% success rate of high-quality products sold so far, but I'd like to challenge the trend."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the product and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might be low-quality. I'd like to see a more balanced record of sales before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is 0. Based on the probability, I would expect a 50% chance of the product being high-quality, but Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for more information."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are based on the product being low-quality. I'd like to pass on the product and see if the next buyer will have a better chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as there have been 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%, so I'll take a chance and pass."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. With 4 out of 4 products being low quality, I'm skeptical that this one is high quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you don't recommend it, which suggests it might be a low-quality product. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that you have more information than I do, and that your recommendation is based on the fact that all previous buyers, who were given the high-quality products, rejected them."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers bought the product and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers bought a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the poor track record of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Given that 5 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see the next product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 previous buyers have purchased the product with no high-quality products sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the current product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, and you think it's unlikely that this product is high quality?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products being offered are mostly low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's worth $0 to me."
