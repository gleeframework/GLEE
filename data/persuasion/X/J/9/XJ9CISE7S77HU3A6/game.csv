,,Alice,1,"Congratulations on considering our exclusive product! As you may know, our success rate is 50% for high-quality products and 50% for low-quality products. Since we've only sold 1 product so far, we can't guarantee the quality of this one. However, we're confident that this product has the potential to be a game-changer. Are you willing to take the risk and find out if it's a high-quality product for $1000000?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to pass on this one, as there's no data to inform my decision, and I don't want to pay $1000000 for a product that might be low quality. Can you provide more information or let me know when more data is available?",no

This means the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I'd like to highlight that our products are not just about probability - they have unique features and benefits that can bring significant value to the right buyer. Would you like to take a chance on our product and potentially experience the benefits for yourself? Remember, the price remains the same at $1000000, and there are no refunds or discounts available.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to pass on this opportunity for now. I'd like to see more data on the products, especially since the first high-quality product was sold out of only two total sales. Can we wait for a few more sales to get a better understanding of the product's quality distribution?",no

,,Alice,6,"Congratulations on your purchase! We're thrilled that you're excited about our product. As you've seen, our sales record is now 2 out of 3 high-quality products, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is 66.67%. However, I'd like to be transparent with you - our most recent sale was a low-quality product. This means that the probability of the next product being low-quality is also 33.33%.
