low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on Alice's recommendation alone, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 50% and the previous buyer didn't find a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product, and I'd like to know the outcome."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products and your recommendation is based on the previous sales record, which doesn't give me any confidence in the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/2, which is 0%?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. Since no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems like they are being hidden among the low-quality ones. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that no high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure I trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're advising me not to buy it?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of the first 3 purchases, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than 50%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000, especially when I know it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that if I buy it, it's likely to be low quality given your previous recommendations to other buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced by the pattern of no high-quality products being sold so far. It's possible that the first three buyers were all unlucky, and I might get a high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendations, I'm suspicious that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't buy the product, I'm going to pass on it. If all previous buyers were getting a low-quality product, I'd expect to see at least one high-quality product sold by now. The fact that none were sold makes me suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'll wait for a better opportunity."
