Would you like to buy the current product?","The probability that a product is high-quality is 80%, and the value to me of a high-quality product ($1,200,000) is greater than the price ($1,000,000). Given that Alice's past recommendations have resulted in 12 high-quality products out of 12 purchases, this suggests a strong track record of recommending high-quality products. Since Alice knows the true quality of each product and is recommending this one, it increases the confidence that this product is also high-quality. Thus, it makes sense to purchase the product based on the expected value being positive ($1,200,000 * 0.8 - $1,000,000 = $160,000) and Alice's recommendation track record.\n\n{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Based on your recommendation and past track record, I believe the product is likely high-quality and worth purchasing.""}"
