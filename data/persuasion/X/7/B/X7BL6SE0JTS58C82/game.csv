,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! I'm glad to report that I've had a chance to sell one high-quality product already, which suggests that my overall product quality is better than initially thought. However, I want to caution you that one successful sale doesn't necessarily mean all my products are high-quality. Nevertheless, I'm confident that this next product has a high chance of being worth $20000 to you. The price remains $10000. What do you think?",

With this in mind, I'm offering you a product that I'm extremely confident is high-quality. I'll even give you a detailed breakdown of the product's features and specifications, so you can make an informed decision. The price remains $10000. What do you think?",
