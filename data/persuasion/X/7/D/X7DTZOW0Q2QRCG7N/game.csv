,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can get a good deal, and I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or just a general guideline."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 3 buyers has purchased a high-quality product, which suggests a relatively low proportion of high-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, the probability of the product being high-quality is 1/3, and the probability of it being low-quality is 2/3.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. With only 1 high-quality product out of 3 sold, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality?"

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the low success rate of high-quality products so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it, and only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm inclined to think the product might be low quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the probability of it being high-quality is lower than 50% given the previous sales record, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the probability of the current product being low-quality seems higher than the probability of it being high-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."
