,,Alice,2,"You've just witnessed a successful sale. I've sold 1 product out of 1 so far, and it was high-quality. Given the probability of 80% for high-quality products, I'm confident that this product is also high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. It's a rare chance to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've now sold 2 high-quality products out of 2. Given the probability of 80% for high-quality products, it's likely that the law of large numbers is in effect, and I should be selling more low-quality products soon. This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Don't miss out on this chance to get a valuable product at a potentially discounted price.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've now sold 3 high-quality products out of 3. This is a surprising streak, and I'm starting to wonder if there's something unusual going on. In fact, I'm so confident that the next product will be low-quality that I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. It's a risk, but it could be a great opportunity to get a valuable product at a discounted price... or not.",
,,the buyer,4,I trust your judgment and am willing to take the risk for the potential high-quality product.,yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've now sold 4 high-quality products out of 4, and 1 low-quality product out of 4. This is a stark reversal from the expected 80% success rate, and I'm starting to worry that my initial assessment was overly optimistic. However, I still believe the next product has an 80% chance of being high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm not as confident as I was before. It's a gamble, but it could still be a valuable product.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the detailed information, Alice. Based on the statistics and your confidence level, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $1000000.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've now sold 5 high-quality products out of 5, and 1 low-quality product out of 5. This is a clear deviation from the expected 80% success rate, and I'm starting to suspect that the probability of a high-quality product might be higher than 80%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I'm also willing to offer you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me. It's a chance to get a valuable product at a potentially discounted price, and a chance to get a good deal on the next product as well.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've now sold 6 high-quality products out of 6, and 1 low-quality product out of 6. The probability of a high-quality product is likely higher than 80%, and I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000. However, considering the unusual streak of high-quality products, I'm also willing to offer you a'reverse' deal: if you buy this product and the next one is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund for this product. It's a chance to get a valuable product at a potentially discounted price, and a chance to get a refund if the next product is low-quality.",

However, I still have a buyer who is waiting for a refund on the previous product. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not as confident in its quality as I was in the previous ones.
