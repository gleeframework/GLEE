If you don't like it, I'll give you a full refund. But I'm only offering this guarantee for the first product. After this, all sales are final.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'd like to buy the current product, but I'd like to clarify that the 100% satisfaction guarantee is only for the first product, so I'll only pay $100 if it's high quality. If it's low quality, I'll pass on the full refund.

This way, you can take a lower risk and still get a great product. The price would be $80, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm still not interested in buying the product. I've already seen that there's a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, and I don't want to pay $80 for a product that might be worth $0 to me. I'd like to pass on this offer as well.
