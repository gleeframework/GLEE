Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'd like to buy the current product, but I'd like to clarify that the 100% satisfaction guarantee is only for the first product, so I'll only pay $100 if it's high quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not interested in buying the product.
