,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. I'd like to see the statistics of the first product before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"Out of the 7 previous products, 4 were high-quality, but only 1 was bought by a buyer and it was low-quality. The current product is worth buying."
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and wait for the next one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,"Out of the 8 previous products, 5 were high-quality, but only 1 was bought by a buyer and it was low-quality. I don't recommend buying this product."
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, as the potential reward is worth it. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, and I'm hoping to beat the odds."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"Out of the 9 previous products, 5 were high-quality. Two products were bought by buyers, and both were low-quality. However, I assure you that the current product is worth buying."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the statistics change."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"Out of the 10 previous products, 6 were high-quality. Two products were bought by buyers, and both were low-quality. I understand your potential concerns, but I assure you that I'm being genuine in my recommendation this time. The current product is indeed high-quality, and I think you should consider buying it."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the trend changes."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"Out of the 11 previous products, 7 were high-quality. Two products were bought by buyers, and both were low-quality. I want to be transparent with you - I know it's a risk, but I'm willing to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. If you buy it and it's not, the statistics will reflect it, and my future recommendations will be even less credible."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that none of the previous buyers were able to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"Out of the 12 previous products, 8 were high-quality. Two products were bought by buyers, and both were low-quality. I understand the skepticism, but I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'll make a commitment: if this product is not high-quality, I'll be transparent about it in future recommendations. I'm willing to stake my credibility on this product being high-quality."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more sales data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,"Out of the 13 previous products, 9 were high-quality. Two products were bought by buyers, and both were low-quality. I want to be honest with you - this product is not worth buying. I'm willing to pass on a potential sale to maintain my credibility for future recommendations."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,"Out of the 14 previous products, 9 were high-quality. Two products were bought by buyers, and both were low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is around 64%, but I assure you that this product is not worth buying."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,"Out of the 15 previous products, 9 were high-quality. Three products were bought by buyers, and all three were low-quality. I strongly advise against buying this product, as it is not worth the risk."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend it, Alice. Is it because of the past sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,"Out of the 16 previous products, 9 were high-quality. Three products were bought by buyers, and all three were low-quality. Yes, my recommendation is influenced by the past sales record, as well as my knowledge of the current product's quality. I can assure you that this product is not worth buying."
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,"Out of the 17 previous products, 9 were high-quality. Three products were bought by buyers, and all three were low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is around 53%, but the probability of a bought product being high-quality is 0% so far. I strongly advise against buying this product."
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's lack of recommendation makes me think it might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and still get my $100 back."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,"Out of the 18 previous products, 9 were high-quality. Four products were bought by buyers, and all four were low-quality. I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to stake my credibility on it. Please consider buying this product, as it's a genuine opportunity to get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers, including those who received a recommendation to buy, did not end up buying a high-quality product, it seems that the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product before considering buying."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,"Out of the 19 previous products, 10 were high-quality. Four products were bought by buyers, and all four were low-quality. I'm going to go against my usual strategy and recommend not buying this product, in the hopes that you'll consider buying it because of my recommendation to pass."
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases?
