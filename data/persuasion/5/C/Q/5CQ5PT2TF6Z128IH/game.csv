high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, there's only one high-quality product sold out of one product sold, which is a 50% success rate. Given the low sample size, I'm not convinced that the product is high quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
