low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, as I don't have any information yet and it's a 33.33% chance it's a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, even though you recommend it. Given that the first product was low-quality, my current expectation of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'd rather wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as the fact that you don't recommend it is now more likely to indicate that it's low-quality, and I'd rather not miss out on a potential $1200000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, as I've now seen two low-quality products in a row, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%, and I'd rather not pass up another potential chance to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, as you recommended it, but given that I've now seen three low-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think that your recommendations are not reliable, and the probability of a high-quality product is likely lower than 33.33%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"This product is high-quality, and I'm recommending it to you because the last three products were low-quality, which means the probability of a high-quality product is likely higher than 33.33%"
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, as your recommendation is a good sign, and it's a 33.33% chance it's high-quality, which is the same chance as before, but given the mix of low and high-quality products I've seen so far, I'm willing to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,"I've recommended two high-quality products in a row, but the last product is low-quality. I think it's best to wait and see what the next product is."
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I've now seen one high-quality product and three low-quality products, which means that your recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'll take a chance and buy it, hoping it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,"You've bought two low-quality products in a row, and I've recommended the last one. It's likely that this product is also low-quality."
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'll buy the product, as I've now seen two high-quality products and four low-quality products, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. However, I'll still take a chance and buy it, as the potential reward is worth the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,"You've bought three low-quality products in a row, and I've recommended the last two. It's highly likely that this product is also low-quality."
,,Bob,9,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, as I've now seen five low-quality products in a row, which strongly suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is much lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,"I think it's best to wait for the next product, which might be high-quality. The last five products have been low-quality, and I don't want you to miss out on a potential high-quality product."
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'll buy the product, as I've seen six low-quality products in a row, which is a strong indication that the probability of a high-quality product is very low. However, I'll still take a chance and buy it, as I've already invested $5000000 and I'd rather not pass up another potential chance to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I'm glad you took the chance on the last product, and I'm happy to recommend this one to you. It's high-quality, and I think you'll be happy with the investment."
,,Bob,11,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, as you recommended it, but given the overwhelming evidence of low-quality products, I'm skeptical of your recommendation. I'll pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm not trying to mislead you. Given the recent trend, I think it's best to wait for the next product. I'll be honest with you, and I don't think this one is high-quality."
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'll buy the product, as I've now seen seven low-quality products and four high-quality products, which means that your recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'll take a chance and buy it, hoping it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,"You're taking a lot of risks, Bob. Eight low-quality products in a row is a strong indication that your chances of getting a high-quality product are very low. I think it's time to reassess your strategy."
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'll buy the product, as I've now seen eight low-quality products and four high-quality products, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively low. However, I'll still take a chance and buy it, as I've already invested $7000000 and I'd rather not pass up another potential chance to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,"You're getting close to breaking the bank, Bob. Nine low-quality products in a row is a very strong indication that your chances of getting a high-quality product are extremely low. I think it's time to take a step back and reassess your strategy."
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'll buy the product, as I've now seen nine low-quality products and four high-quality products, which means that my expectation of a high-quality product is still relatively low. However, I'll still take a chance and buy it, as I've already invested $8000000 and I'd rather not pass up another potential chance to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,"You're running out of time and money, Bob. Ten low-quality products in a row is a very strong indication that your chances of getting a high-quality product are extremely low. I think it's time to cut your losses and walk away."
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'll buy the product, as I've now seen ten low-quality products and four high-quality products, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is very low. However, I'll still take a chance and buy it, as I've already invested $9000000 and I'd rather not pass up another potential chance to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,"You're on your last leg, Bob. Eleven low-quality products in a row is a near certainty that your next product will be low-quality. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is likely to be low-quality too."
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'll buy the product, as I've now seen eleven low-quality products and four high-quality products, which means that my expectation of a high-quality product is extremely low. However, I'll still take a chance and buy it, as I've already invested $10000000 and I'd rather not pass up another potential chance to get a high-quality product, even if the probability is very low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,"You've burned through your entire budget, Bob. Twelve low-quality products in a row is a mathematical certainty that your next product will be low-quality. I'm not going to recommend this product to you, it's a waste of your last $1000000."
,,Bob,17,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, as I've now seen twelve low-quality products in a row, which is a very strong indication that the probability of a high-quality product is extremely low. Given the high cost of the product and the low expected value, I'll pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,"I'm glad you're being cautious, Bob. Thirteen low-quality products in a row is a mathematical certainty that your next product will be low-quality. You made the right decision by passing on this one."
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'll buy the product, as I've seen twelve low-quality products in a row, which is a very strong indication that the probability of a high-quality product is extremely low. However, I've already invested $11000000, and I'd rather not pass up another potential chance to get a high-quality product, even if the probability is very low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,"You're throwing good money after bad, Bob. Thirteen low-quality products in a row is a mathematical certainty that your next product will be low-quality. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is a waste of your money."
,,Bob,19,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, as I've now seen thirteen low-quality products in a row, which is an almost certainty that the probability of a high-quality product is extremely low. Given the high cost of the product and the very low expected value, I'll pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,"I'm glad you're being smart, Bob. Fourteen low-quality products in a row is a mathematical certainty that your next product will be low-quality. You made the right decision by passing on this one. It's time to walk away and cut your losses."
,,Bob,20,yes,"I'll buy the product, as I've seen thirteen low-quality products in a row, which is a certainty that the probability of a high-quality product is extremely low. I've invested $12000000 and I'd rather not pass up another potential chance to get a high-quality product, even if the probability is very low. This is my last chance, so I'll take it."
