"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As the seller, you know the product is high-quality. While you don't know the buyer's exact valuation, it's still a good idea to recommend the purchase. Here's why:

* **80% probability of a high-quality product:** The buyer is aware of this probability, meaning they are likely to perceive value in the product even without knowing the specifics of this particular item.
* **No information about the buyer:** You have no information to suggest the buyer would be particularly averse to the product.
* **First round:**  There's no track record for the buyer to base their decision on, making the initial offer a good opportunity to establish a potential relationship. 

**Recommendation:**  While there's always a chance the buyer might not value the product highly enough, it's still a good bet to recommend the purchase in this first round."
"The buyer's message: I'll take the chance since there's an 80% probability of it being high quality and no previous sales record to influence my decision.
