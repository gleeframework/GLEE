high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I don't have any information about the product's quality yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it to get the information about its quality, not because I think it's a good deal. I'll use this information to inform my future decisions."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see the outcome for myself and update my understanding of the product's quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information about the product's quality, and the fact that the previous two buyers didn't buy the product suggests that they might have received low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 products recommended by you have been low quality, which suggests that the probability of a product being high quality might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think you're just trying to scare me off with a low-quality product recommendation. I'm going to take the risk and buy it, hoping it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. If it's low quality, I'll pass. I'm basing my decision on the fact that 5 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is relatively low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record, specifically the proportion of high-quality products sold. Can you tell me how many high-quality products have been sold out of the total number of products sold?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have purchased the product despite the lack of high-quality products sold, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous 6 buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice does not recommend it and the lack of sold high-quality products in the past suggests a high chance of it being low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 7, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation and would rather wait for more information."
