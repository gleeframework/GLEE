low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyer's purchase, which may be due to a lucky guess rather than a reliable indicator of the product's quality."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it, which suggests it might be low-quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $10000, which would be a good deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the 50/50 chance of it being high-quality, and the fact that two high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I want to see the outcome of the previous 3 buyers' purchases to make a more informed decision for myself.

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is based on the previous sales record, so I'm hoping that the trend might not continue."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the probability of it being low-quality based on your previous recommendations. I'm not sure if I'd be willing to buy if I didn't have this information."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the recommendation is based on the fact that 3 out of 5 previous buyers bought, which suggests a higher proportion of high-quality products than the true probability of 50%. I'd like to wait for more information to make a more informed decision."

,,Alice,19,yes,"I recommended this product because it's actually high-quality, and I'm trying to sell it to you at the full price of $10000. I know the past sales record may have been misleading, but I assure you that this product is worth the price."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only 3 high-quality products sold out of 5, it seems the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%, so I'll take a chance and pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 high-quality products have been sold out of 5, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality might be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
