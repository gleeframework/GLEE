"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have no information about the product's quality, and Alice is recommending it, it's worth taking the gamble.  There's a 50% chance you'll get a high-quality product worth $40,000, and a 50% chance you'll get a low-quality product worth $0.  Since the potential gain significantly outweighs the potential loss, it's a good idea to buy."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one. Thanks for the information.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is now a strong signal.  Since she's not recommending the product, it's likely she's seeing it as a low-quality product.  While it's still a 50/50 chance, it's better to err on the side of caution when the potential loss is significant ($10,000).  Passing allows you to preserve your capital for future rounds."

```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice was wrong in the last round, her track record is still better than random. Since she's recommending the product, there's a higher chance it's high-quality. While there's still risk, the potential reward of $40,000 outweighs the potential loss of $10,000."
