**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** This is valuable information. Even though Alice knows the true value of each product, she is recommending you buy it, which suggests it is likely high quality.
* **Past sales:** The previous buyer purchasing a product suggests it was likely high quality (since they are rational and would only buy if the product is worth it).
* **Probability:** While the initial probability of getting a high-quality product is low (33.33%), the combination of Alice's recommendation and the previous sale's success makes the product significantly more likely to be high quality. 

**Risk vs. Reward:** Even though there's still a chance it's low quality, the potential reward of $300 outweighs the risk of losing $100."
