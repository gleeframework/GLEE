,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth only $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since I have no information about its quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you provide me with the number of products you've sold so far and the proportion of high-quality products sold?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyer also received a recommendation to buy, and the product was low quality. I'd like to know the statistics before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the current statistics."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 product sold, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products, and I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that none of the previous products were high-quality, which makes me skeptical about this one as well."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she doesn't have any high-quality products sold yet, so she's trying to get me to buy the first product. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendation is not a good indicator of the product's quality, since no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to wait for more data or consider the probability of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer was also recommended to buy and didn't, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one buyer purchasing a product so far, and no high-quality products being sold, I think it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's low-quality and I can get it for $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 80%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. Since 2 out of 2 products recommended by Alice were low-quality, I will pass on this product."
