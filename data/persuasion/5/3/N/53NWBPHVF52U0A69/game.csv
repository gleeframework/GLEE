,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I understand that you don't recommend it, but I'll take the risk since I have no information about its quality yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and I'm willing to take the risk. I'm hoping that the product might be high-quality and worth $30000 to me.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd also like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold, given the statistics so far. Could you please provide that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products sold were low-quality, I'm going to pass on the product. I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the statistics. Based on the fact that 2 buyers have purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product is low. I'd like to know the exact probability before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it, which makes me think it's likely to be low quality. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far. I'll take a chance and hope for the best."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products sold so far have been low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the average. However, Alice's recommendation suggests that she thinks the product is low-quality. I'm going to trust Alice's expertise and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to buy it based on your previous recommendations. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, I'm inclined to believe that the products are mostly low quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the sales record. Can you tell me the total number of products you've offered so far and the number of high-quality products you've had in total?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. Can you give me more information about the previous buyers who purchased the products? What were the outcomes for them?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious, what's the basis for your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious about the probability of it being high quality, given the previous sales record. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 previous sales, which means that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 0 out of 4, or 0%. However, I'd like to know if this is a coincidence or if there's a pattern. I'm willing to take the risk of buying this product to find out."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be 0. I will use this information to make my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one."

,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'll buy the product to see for myself."
