,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if I can get a good deal on a high-quality product, and the fact that you didn't recommend it might actually make it more likely to be high-quality, given that you don't know my valuation."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on her incomplete information and I don't want to make a decision based on potentially biased advice.

Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 products, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is 50%. However, Alice's recommendation not to buy it makes me even more cautious. I'd like to wait for the next product."
