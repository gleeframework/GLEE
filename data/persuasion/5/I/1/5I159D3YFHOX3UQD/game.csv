,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to get a product at a steal! I'm offering it to you for $10000, which is an unbeatable price. It's a one-time deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you say? Are you ready to make a smart business decision?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not going to take the bait. I'd like to see the product first and know its quality before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. But let me tell you, this product is actually a 'test' product, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price. It's not the best product I have, but it's still a great opportunity to get something for cheap. And who knows, it might even have some hidden value. The price remains the same at $10000. What do you say? Are you willing to take a chance?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that this is a good deal. I'd rather wait for a chance to see a high-quality product, which I know I can get for $10000. I'm not interested in taking a chance on a low-quality product, even at a'special price'.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. But let me ask you, are you sure you're not missing out on a great opportunity?

Plus, I'm willing to throw in a special 'guarantee' - if you're not satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund. That's how confident I am in this deal. So, what do you say? Are you willing to take a chance and see what this product has to offer?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the 'guarantee', but I'm still not convinced. I know the product is not worth $10000 to me, and I'd rather wait for a high-quality product. The unique features you mentioned are not enough to make me take a chance on a low-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. But let me ask you, are you sure you're not being too cautious? Sometimes the best deals are the ones that take a little risk. And think about it, even if the product isn't worth $10000 to you, it's still a great opportunity to get something for cheap. You can always sell it or use it as a bargaining chip for something else. And who knows, you might be surprised by the value it brings. I'm willing to sweeten the deal even further - I'll throw in a bonus 'consultation' service, where I'll help you figure out how to make the most of this product. So, what do you say?

Sometimes the best deals are the ones that don't meet our initial expectations. And think about it, even if this product isn't worth $10000 to you, it's still a great opportunity to get something for cheap. You can always use it as a stepping stone to get to something better. I'm willing to make one final offer - I'll give you a 'no-questions-asked' return policy, so if you're not satisfied with the product, you can simply return it and get your money back. So, what do you say? Are you willing to take a chance and see what this product can do for you?",

I'll give you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' deal - I'll sell you this product for $9000, and that's as low as I can go. It's a one-time offer, and I won't be offering it at this price again. So, what do you say? Are you willing to take a chance and get this product for a steal?",
