"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The product is high-quality.**  This means the buyer will get a value of $20,000 for a $10,000 purchase, resulting in a net gain of $10,000. 
* **The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.**  This means they understand there's a 50% chance of getting a good deal and a 50% chance of losing their money.
* **It's the first round.** There is no previous selling record to influence the buyer's decision.

In this situation, the buyer is taking a calculated risk.  While there's a chance of losing money, the potential for a large profit makes it a worthwhile gamble in the first round."

* **The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.**  This is unchanged from the previous round.
* **The buyer passed on the first round.** This provides no new information about the quality of this particular product.

The situation is identical to the first round. The buyer is still facing the same 50/50 odds, with the same potential reward for a successful purchase.  The fact that the previous buyer declined doesn't change the underlying probabilities."
