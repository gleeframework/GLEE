Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has experienced an incredibly lucky streak with high-quality products, the probability of receiving a high-quality product remains at 80%.  This means there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, and the cost of that risk is significant (a $10,000 loss).  

* **Risk Assessment:**  Even with Alice's impressive track record, it's crucial to remember that the underlying probability hasn't changed. 
* **Potential Loss:**  The potential loss of $10,000 outweighs the potential gain of $10,000 since Bob has already earned a significant amount of money. 

**Recommendation:** In this round, it's more prudent for Bob to avoid the risk and decline the purchase."

* **Previous Decision:** Bob's decision to pass on the previous round, even though he trusted Alice, shows that he's becoming more risk-averse. 
* **Potential Loss:**  The potential loss of $10,000 outweighs the potential gain of $10,000, especially after Bob's recent lucky streak.

**Recommendation:**  It's wise for Bob to continue to be cautious and decline the purchase in Round 17."
