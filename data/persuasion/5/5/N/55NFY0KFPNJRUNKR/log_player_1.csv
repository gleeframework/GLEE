This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you have a high-quality product in this round. Since Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and you have no information about how much Bob values a high-quality product, it's a good idea to recommend the purchase.  Bob has a 50% chance of getting a high-value product, which is worth taking a gamble on, especially since the price is fixed."

Since Bob bought the product in the previous round, we can assume that the value he places on a high-quality product is at least $100.  Knowing this, it's still a good gamble to recommend a high-quality product in this round, as Bob is likely to value it at least as much as the price."
