"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($1,250,000 - $1,000,000 = $250,000) outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000. 

It's a gamble, but with an 80% chance of a high-quality product, it's a risk worth taking in the first round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. However, I'm going to pass on this one. I'll see what you have to offer next round.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice not recommending the product is a strong signal. Since she doesn't know your valuation, her recommendation is based on the product's quality. It's highly probable that the product is low quality.  

The potential gain is $250,000, but the risk of losing $1,000,000 is too high when Alice is not recommending the product. It's better to pass and wait for a potentially better opportunity."
