,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think the low probability of a high-quality product and the lack of sales so far suggests it's likely to be a low-quality product.

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice recommends every product, it's likely that Alice is not aware of the true quality of the products. I'd like to observe more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,20,yes,
