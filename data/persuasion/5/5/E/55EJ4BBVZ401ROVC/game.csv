,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation not to buy. I'm hoping to defy the odds and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers passed on the product and no high-quality products were sold, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'll pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm hesitant to buy the product based on your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next buyer is more optimistic.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and both were low-quality products, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to see more information or a different recommendation before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the current statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. However, given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also passed on the products, and none of the products sold so far have been high-quality, I'm starting to suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
