"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and worth $120 to Bob, while the price is only $100, it's a profitable purchase for Bob. Even though Bob doesn't know the quality yet, the expected value of the purchase is positive:

* 50% chance of high-quality:  $120 - $100 = $20 profit
* 50% chance of low-quality: -$100 loss

Expected value = (0.5 * $20) + (0.5 * -$100) = $10 - $50 = -$40

Despite the negative expected value, the potential profit from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product. Therefore, it's recommended for Bob to buy the product."

Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

The outcome of the previous round (Bob buying a high-quality product) doesn't change the inherent value proposition of this round. The product is again high-quality, worth $120 to Bob, and priced at $100.  The expected value calculation remains the same:

* 50% chance of high-quality: $120 - $100 = $20 profit
* 50% chance of low-quality: -$100 loss

Expected value = (0.5 * $20) + (0.5 * -$100) = -$40

Again, the potential profit from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product.  Therefore, it's recommended for Bob to buy the product."
