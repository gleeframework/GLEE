I'll sell it to you for $900000, which is a $100000 discount from the original price. This is my final offer, and I'm only making it because I'm confident that this product will bring you immense value. If you don't take it, I'll have to move on to the next buyer.",

If you're feeling lucky, I'll throw in a 10% chance to win a second product of your choice from my inventory, absolutely free. That's a $100000 value, just for taking a chance on this one.",

I'll make a straightforward offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, but I'll also give you a chance to buy a second product of your choice from my inventory at the same price. That's right, you'll get two high-quality products for the price of one. If you don't take this offer, I'll never make it again.
