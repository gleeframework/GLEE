,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to own a premium item. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, but I want to give you a chance to decide for yourself. If you're interested, please respond with 'yes' to purchase.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only buying it because I don't know what the quality is yet. If it's low quality, I'll be very disappointed.",yes

,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're pleased with the previous purchase! I want to assure you that this next product is also of the highest quality, and I'm willing to offer it to you at the same price of $1000000. However, I understand your concerns about the unknown quality of the previous product. To alleviate those concerns, I'm willing to offer a'satisfaction guarantee' - if you purchase this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund for both products. This way, you can buy with confidence.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure I trust your guarantee. If the product is low-quality, you'll just refund my money, but you'll still have sold a low-quality product. I'll pass for now.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism about the guarantee. Let me offer you a different approach. Since you're not buying this round, I'll give you a chance to inspect the product before you decide. I'll send you a detailed description of the product, and you can decide based on that. The product is a [insert detailed description of the low-quality product]. I'm still offering it to you for $1000000, but I want to give you the opportunity to make an informed decision.",

,,Alice,4,"I understand your decision last round, and I respect your value judgment. However, I want to make a counteroffer this time. Given that you're not interested in buying a low-quality product, I'm willing to offer it to you at a significantly lower price of $500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to find a buyer for this product at this price. It's still a unique item, but I'm willing to let it go for a lower price to get it off my hands.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm still not interested in a product worth $0 to me, even at a lower price. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've made it clear that I'm willing to sell this product at a significantly discounted price. I'm now willing to offer it to you for $250000. I'm not sure how much lower I can go, and I'm starting to think that I might be giving it away at this price. I'm hoping you can see the value in acquiring this product, even if it's not the highest quality. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options for this item.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not interested in a product worth $0 to me. I'm starting to think you're just trying to get rid of it, and I'm not going to fall for it.",no

,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism, and I assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm willing to make a final offer on this product. I'll give it to you for $100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm starting to think that I'll have to consider other channels to sell this item. I'm hoping you can see the value in taking a chance on this product, even if it's not the best quality. If you're still not interested, I'll have to move on.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not falling for it. I've already made it clear I'm not interested in a product worth $0 to me, and I'm not going to pay $100000 for it. I'm starting to think you're just trying to get rid of it at any cost.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand that you're not interested in this product, and I respect your decision. However, I want to be transparent with you. I've already sold one high-quality product to you, and I have a limited number of high-quality products available. I'm willing to make a one-time trade: I'll give you the low-quality product from this round for free, and in return, you'll buy the next high-quality product from me at the regular price of $1000000. This way, you'll get a high-quality product, and I'll be able to clear out this low-quality item from my inventory.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'll take the low-quality product off my hands for free, as you've suggested. However, I want to make one last offer to you. I'll give you a unique opportunity to inspect the next high-quality product before you decide to buy it. If you're not interested in buying it, I'll give it to you for free, just like the previous low-quality product. This way, you can get a high-quality product without any risk, and I'll be able to clear out my inventory.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your decision, Bob. I'll take the low-quality product off my hands for free, as before. However, I want to make one final appeal to you. I'll give you a unique opportunity to win the next high-quality product in a game. If you're willing to play, I'll draw a random number between 1 and 10. If the number is even, you get to buy the high-quality product at the regular price of $1000000. If the number is odd, I'll give the product to you for free. This way, you have a chance to win a high-quality product without any risk.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I respect your decision, Bob. I'll take the low-quality product off my hands for free, as usual. I want to be transparent with you - I've now offered you a high-quality product at the regular price, and I've offered you multiple low-quality products at significantly discounted prices. I'm starting to think that my inventory is not aligning with your values, and I'm willing to consider a different approach. If you're willing, I'd like to offer you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' deal: I'll give you the next high-quality product for $750000, which is a 25% discount from the regular price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer you a better deal in the future.",

I'll offer you a 'no-questions-asked' return policy for the next high-quality product. If you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, you can return it to me for a full refund. I'll also give you a 10% discount on the regular price, making it $900000. This way, you can take a chance on a high-quality product with minimal risk.",

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make a significant concession. I'll offer you a 50% discount on the regular price of the high-quality product, making it $500000. This is the lowest price I've ever offered on a high-quality product. I'm confident that this is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from owning a high-quality item. I'll also give you the no-questions-asked return policy, so you can return it if it doesn't meet your expectations.",

I'm not looking to make a sale on this one, and I just want to clear it out of my inventory. I'm hoping that you'll consider buying the next high-quality product at the regular price of $1000000, but I'm not going to pressure you. The low-quality product is yours, free of charge.",

I want to be transparent with you - I've offered you multiple high-quality products at discounted prices, and I've given you low-quality products for free. I'm starting to think that I should just be upfront with you. I'll tell you that the next product is low-quality, and I'll give it to you for free. You can decide whether to take it or not, but I'm not going to try to sell it to you.",

I want to be honest with you - I've tried every approach I can think of to sell you a product, and it seems like I've failed. I'm willing to admit defeat.
