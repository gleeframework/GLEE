I've offered you 15 low-quality products, and you've passed on all of them. I think it's safe to say that you're a savvy customer who knows a good deal when you see one. I'm glad we could work together, and I hope you're happy with the products you've purchased. This last product is... well, let's just say it's a parting gift.
