**Explanation:**

Even though the odds are 50/50, there is a strong incentive to buy the product. Here's why:

* **Limited Information:** We have limited information about the product's quality. The only data point is the previous buyer purchasing a high-quality product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a valuable signal. Even though she doesn't know our individual valuation, she is likely to recommend products she believes are more likely to be high quality. This is because a high-quality sale is better for her than a low-quality one.
* **Potential Upward Value:** The potential gain from a high-quality product is substantial ($30,000). 
* **Limited Loss:** The potential loss from a low-quality product is limited to the purchase price ($10,000).

While the odds are 50/50, the potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario."
