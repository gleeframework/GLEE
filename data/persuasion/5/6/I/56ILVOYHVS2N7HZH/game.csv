,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as there's no prior data to influence my decision, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards encouraging a sale, especially since she doesn't know the true value of the product to me. I'd like to wait and see how the next product is recommended."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the data so far. Can you share the probability?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, as I believe the potential reward of getting a high-quality product outweighs the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's lack of recommendation, which suggests to me that the product might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product so that the probability of a high-quality product being sold increases for the next buyer."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I'm inclined to think that the products being offered are more likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait and see if I can get a better offer or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first three products, I'm concerned that this product may also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she doesn't know how valuable the product is to me, and she has a 50% chance of recommending a low-quality product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still 50%, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the fact that you're not recommending it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that you don't know my valuation and that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation based on the statistics. The fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather wait for more information or try to negotiate a better price.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know the probability of the next product being high quality, based on the statistics, and I'd like Alice to reveal the quality of this product as well."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 previous buyers passed on the products after your recommendation, I suspect that your recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'd like to know the statistics of the previous 4 buyers and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. What is the proportion of high-quality products sold out of all products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given that the previous 4 buyers have all been recommended to pass and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than the 50% average, and I'd like to take advantage of this potential opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm going to pass on it. If you recommend me to buy, I would have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, but since you're not recommending it, I'm going to assume that the product is more likely to be low-quality."
