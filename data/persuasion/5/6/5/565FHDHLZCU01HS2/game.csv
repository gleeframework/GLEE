As for the next product, I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing you with the best possible products.

I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000, but I want to give you a heads up that it's not as high-quality as the first one. It's still a great product, but it's not worth $30000 to you. What do you think?",

However, I want to be transparent with you - the probability of it being high-quality is not affected by the previous products. Each product is an independent draw. That being said, I'm willing to offer you a slight discount for this product, considering you've taken two chances already. I'll sell it to you for $9500. Is that a deal you'd like to take?",

In fact, I'm being completely honest with you, this product is not worth $30000 to you at all. It's essentially worthless to you. But, I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is the same price as the previous products. I'm doing this as a gesture of goodwill, and I want to make sure you're aware of the value you're getting. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you for $10000.
