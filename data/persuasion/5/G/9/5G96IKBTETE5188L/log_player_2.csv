"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($1,250,000) outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000).  Since Alice knows the quality and is recommending it, there's a higher likelihood it's high quality, making the gamble worth it."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's lack of recommendation is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. Since she knows the true value, her silence implies a high probability of a $1,000,000 loss. It's better to err on the side of caution and pass on this offer."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'm feeling optimistic about this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's recommendation isn't foolproof, it's still valuable information.  We know that a recommendation from her means the product is more likely to be high quality than not.  The potential gain of $1,250,000 is still attractive enough to outweigh the risk of losing $1,000,000. The previous round's experience with a low-quality product doesn't invalidate the potential value of Alice's recommendations."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's consistent pattern of recommending high-quality products and not recommending low-quality products is becoming evident. Since she's not recommending this product, it's highly likely to be low quality, and the risk of losing $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gain."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's pattern of recommending high-quality products and not recommending low-quality products is becoming increasingly reliable.
