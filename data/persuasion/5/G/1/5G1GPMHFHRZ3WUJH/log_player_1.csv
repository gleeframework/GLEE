That's a great track record, don't you think?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your inspection and the reassurance. However, I'd like to point out that the track record isn't as great as you make it seem. With only 2 products sold, the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, and I shouldn't be swayed by a single data point. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know: what's the total number of products you have available, and how many more are there after the sale to me?

But I can tell you that the remaining 16 products are a mix of both high-quality and low-quality items. And at $10,000, you're getting a great chance to own something new, regardless of its quality.

It's a steal!""

That's a 66.7% success rate, if you will. And I'm willing to make a deal with you: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a special discount on your next purchase. You'll get 20% off the next product you buy from me. That's a great deal, if I do say so myself. So, what do you say? Are you ready to take the chance and own a high-quality product?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by the statistics. With only 3 sales, the sample size is too small to draw any reliable conclusions.

I'll tell you that the products I've sold so far were randomly selected from my inventory, and I didn't have any prior knowledge of their quality. I simply presented them to the buyers as-is. As for how I determine the quality, well, I don't really have a formal process. I just kind of... know when a product is high-quality, I guess. But I can assure you that I'm a reputable seller, and I'm not trying to scam anyone. This product, for example, is definitely not high-quality. It's a bit of a dud, to be honest. But at $10,000, it's still a great value! You could use it as a decoration or something. So, what do you say? Are you willing to take a chance on this product?""
}"

To be honest, I've been experimenting with different suppliers and products, and it seems that not all of them meet my standards. But I'm committed to improving my quality control process, and I'm working hard to ensure that the products I sell meet the highest standards. This product, for example, is one of the ones that didn't quite make the cut. It's still a good product, but not the best.
