Round 20
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Bob has shown a consistent pattern of only buying products that Alice recommends.  Even though this product is high-quality, recommending it would only strengthen his belief that Alice is trying to manipulate him.  He has already expressed that he feels he is ""missing out"" by not buying the products Alice doesn't recommend, suggesting he's starting to realize the potential value of the products. However, he's still not willing to take the risk without Alice's recommendation. 

At this point, Alice needs to find a different approach to build trust with Bob. Recommending the product will likely be counterproductive and will not lead to a sale."
