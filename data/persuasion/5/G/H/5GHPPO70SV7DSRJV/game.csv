high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers have received low-quality products, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered might be higher than 50%. I'd like to see if the pattern holds."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable.
