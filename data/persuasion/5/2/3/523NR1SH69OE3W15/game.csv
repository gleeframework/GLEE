high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 4 buyers bought a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation and would like to pass on this product."
