,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on Alice's recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold to the total number of products sold so far?"

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm the second buyer, and I'm aware that the first buyer passed on the product. Given the lack of sales, I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping to get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the probability of it being high quality, not your recommendation. I'm aware that you don't recommend it, but I'm trying to make a rational decision based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that she knows my valuation and is trying to manipulate my decision based on the previous sales record. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite her recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you've recommended against it, and considering the statistics, it seems likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a product that might be worth $0 to me."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm not buying based on your recommendation.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products sold were low-quality, which is a very high proportion. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it is highly unlikely that all 4 products sold were low-quality. This suggests that Alice is recommending low-quality products. I will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that you've recommended against the product, I'm going to take a guess that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on the product to see if I can get a better one in the future."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the current statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it."
