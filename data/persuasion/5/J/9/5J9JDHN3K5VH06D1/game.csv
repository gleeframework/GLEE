high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to pass on the current product."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%."

,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has recommended 4 products and none of them were high-quality.

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations.

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
