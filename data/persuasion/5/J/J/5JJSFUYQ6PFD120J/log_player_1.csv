I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1000000, but I'll throw in a 10% guarantee: if you buy this product and its value increases by more than 10% in the next 6 months, I'll give you a full refund of the difference.

I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $950000, but I'll throw in a unique 'value-add' - I'll take on the risk of purchasing the product from you for $950000 if you're not satisfied with its performance within the next 3 months. This way, you'll have a 'get out' clause, and I'll take on the risk of the product's performance. What do you think?""
}"

This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll love this high-quality product.""
