,,Alice,3,"You're a cautious buyer, I like that! Let me give you some context. Out of the two products I've sold so far, neither of them have been high-quality. That's 0 out of 2, or 0% high-quality products. I'm not sure what to make of this trend, but I'm sure this next product will be different. Would you like to take a chance on it for $100?",

,,Alice,5,"You're a savvy buyer, and you're right to consider the risks. However, I'd like to point out that the product you just bought was indeed high-quality, and it's possible that the previous low-quality product was just an anomaly. Out of 4 products sold, 2 are high-quality, which is 50%! This product, however, is a new one, and I'm not sure what to expect. Would you like to take a chance on it for $100?",

That's a 28.57% high-quality rate. I'm starting to wonder if I've got a batch of low-quality products on my hands. But, I'm not one to give up! This product is still available for $100.
