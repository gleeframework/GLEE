"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the odds are against Bob, there's a 33.33% chance the product is high quality and worth $12,000.  Since Alice knows the quality of the product and is recommending it, it's likely she has chosen a high-quality one.  

**It's important to note:** This is a risky strategy, and Bob is relying on Alice's recommendation.  He could be better off refusing to buy anything and hoping for a better chance later."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the information, Alice.  I'll pass on this one. ""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's recommendation is now reversed. She previously recommended buying and it was good. Now, she is not recommending, which makes it more likely this product is low quality (worth $0 to Bob). 
* Bob is risk-averse, and the potential loss of $10,000 outweighs the potential gain of $2,000. 
* He's better off waiting for another opportunity, potentially hoping for a recommendation again."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the update, Alice.  I'll pass on this one as well.  ""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is still not recommending the product. This reinforces the idea that it's more likely to be low-quality. 
* There's no reason to deviate from the strategy established in Round 2: Bob is better off waiting for a possible recommendation and a higher chance of a profitable deal."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'm taking a chance on this one!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation is back.**  She's recommending the product, which is a strong signal that it's likely high-quality. 
* **Consistency:** While Bob passed on the last two products when Alice didn't recommend, her recommendation now carries weight.  It's a pattern.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  It's a gamble, but the potential $12,000 profit is enticing. 

**Important Note:** This strategy is still based on Alice being a reliable source of information. There is a chance she's deliberately trying to mislead Bob."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the update, Alice. I'll pass on this one. ""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pattern Recognition:** Bob has established a pattern: Alice's recommendation is a reliable indicator of high-quality products. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Given her lack of recommendation, it's highly likely this product is low-quality. The potential loss of $10,000 outweighs the potential gain of $2,000. 
* **Waiting for Opportunity:** Bob is better off waiting for another round where Alice might recommend a product, increasing his chances of a profitable purchase."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

* **Consistency:**  The pattern from previous rounds continues. Alice not recommending the product suggests it's likely low quality. 
* **Risk Aversion:** Bob has established a strategy of waiting for Alice's recommendations to minimize losses.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  The potential gain from this product is not worth the risk of losing $10,000.  He's better off waiting for a better opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the update, Alice. I'll pass on this one. ""}

* **Pattern Recognition:**  Bob has established a clear pattern of Alice's recommendations being a reliable indicator of product quality.
