```"
"Bob's message: Alice, your offer of a personal guarantee is appreciated, and it does show your confidence in the product. However, I'm still hesitant. While a 10% return is enticing, it's not enough to outweigh the lack of transparency and the significant risk involved in investing such a large sum without concrete information. I'm also concerned about the possibility of unforeseen circumstances affecting your ability to fulfill that guarantee.  Perhaps we can revisit this offer when there is more information available about the product, or if you can provide some independent verification of its potential.

"Bob's message: Alice, a statement from a third-party investor is a step in the right direction.  However, I still need to know more about the product itself.  Could you share the name of the investor and their industry?  I would also like to see the statement itself and verify its authenticity before making a decision.
