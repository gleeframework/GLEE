  ""message"": ""Congratulations to the previous buyer for taking the risk! We're glad they were rewarded with a high-quality product. Now, let's talk about you.

Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity and buy it for $10000?""

Round 5

A new potential buyer has arrived!

  ""message"": ""Fair point, our previous success rate was indeed the prior probability. Let's look at it from a different angle. We've sold 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, which means that our current ratio of high-quality to total products is 2:3. This is actually lower than the prior probability of 1:3. Maybe this product is the one that will turn the tide in our favor? It's still $10000, and you might be the one to break the streak.""
}"
