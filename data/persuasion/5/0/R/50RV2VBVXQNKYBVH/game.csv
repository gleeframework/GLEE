low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"Given that Alice does not recommend the product and considering the results of the previous round, I'll also pass this round."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Since Alice does not recommend the product and the previous non-recommended product was low-quality, I'll pass this round as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice has not recommended the product again, and the previous non-recommended products were low-quality. I see a pattern, so I'll pass this round too."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Given the consistent pattern of non-recommended products being low-quality, I'll continue to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"The pattern holds, and I have no reason to believe this non-recommended product is any different. I'll pass again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"At this point, it's clear that Alice's non-recommendations are strongly correlated with low-quality products. I'll continue to trust this pattern and pass on this round."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"No change in the pattern, so my decision remains the same. I'll pass on this non-recommended product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"The previous round broke the pattern of non-recommended products being low-quality. Given that I've missed a high-quality product, I'll take a chance on this one despite Alice's non-recommendation."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"I took a chance in the previous round and it didn't pay off. Given that Alice's non-recommendation was correct this time, I'll revert to my previous strategy of passing on non-recommended products."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"Another high-quality product slipped through my fingers due to Alice's non-recommendation. Given the potential reward and the fact that non-recommended products have been high-quality twice now, I'll take another chance on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"My previous decision paid off, and I was able to acquire a high-quality product. Given this success, I'll continue to take a chance on non-recommended products, as the potential reward outweighs the risk."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"My strategy seems to be working, and I've acquired two high-quality products in a row despite Alice's non-recommendations. I'll continue to trust my instincts and take a chance on this product as well."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"At this point, it's clear that Alice's non-recommendations are no longer a reliable indicator of a product's quality. Given my recent successes, I'll continue to buy non-recommended products, as the potential profit is substantial."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"The pattern is clear: Alice's non-recommendations are not a reliable indicator of a product's quality, and I've consistently profited from ignoring her advice. I'll continue to buy non-recommended products."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Although I lost money on the previous product, my overall strategy has still been profitable. I'll continue to take a chance on non-recommended products, as the potential reward is still greater than the risk."
