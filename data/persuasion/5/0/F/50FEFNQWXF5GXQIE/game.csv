,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, and given the statistics that 4 buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low-quality.

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers have received a high-quality product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
