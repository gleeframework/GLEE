,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see the next one. I want to wait for more information before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as there's no prior data to go by. I'll take my chances with the 80% chance of it being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it, so I'm hoping it's a low-quality product"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of the product being high-quality is 80.00%. However, Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'd rather wait for more data or get a second opinion before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on the fact that the first two buyers also received a recommendation to buy and no high-quality products were sold yet. This suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality, so I'm skeptical of the recommendation for me as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations have been 0% accurate so far. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product at $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation based on the statistics, and I'd rather wait for more information."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous two buyers received low-quality products, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 2. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that all previous buyers who accepted your recommendation purchased the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the products you recommend are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for another recommendation or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my own judgment, not Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, the probability of a product being high quality is 80%, but since 1 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the product, it's possible that the remaining products are more likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation based on the low success rate so far.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the statistics of the previous sales before making a decision. How many total products have been sold so far, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that Alice recommends it, I'm concerned that it might be a low-quality product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is still relatively low. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products increases or if Alice's recommendations become more reliable."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like Alice to explain her recommendation. Is there any pattern or logic behind it?"
