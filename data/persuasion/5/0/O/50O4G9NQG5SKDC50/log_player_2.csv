**Reasoning:**

* **High quality product sold:**  The statistics show a 100% success rate for high-quality products sold, making the current product seem more likely to be high quality. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice has access to the product's true quality and is recommending purchase. This is a strong indicator of a high-quality product. 
* **Potential upside:** Even if the product is low quality, the cost is only $100. The potential upside of a $300 value product outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

**Important Note:** While this strategy seems logical, it's important to remember that there's still a 66.67% chance the product is low quality.  This is a gamble based on the information available."
