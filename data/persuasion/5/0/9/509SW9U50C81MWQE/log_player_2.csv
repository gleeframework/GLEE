**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very limited information about the product's quality.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has an incentive to recommend buying the product, even if it's low quality. She gets paid regardless of the quality.
* **Prior Probability:** The prior probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.
* **One High-Quality Sale:**  The fact that one high-quality product was sold to a previous buyer doesn't significantly change the odds.  The odds could have been purely random. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If the product is high quality, the reward is $200 (worth $300 to you, cost $100). If it's low quality, the loss is $100. This risk vs. reward balance makes it worth trying.

**Conclusion:** It's a gamble, but the potential reward outweighs the risk, given the limited information."
