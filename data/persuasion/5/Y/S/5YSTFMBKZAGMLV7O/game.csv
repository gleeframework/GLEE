,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't think it's a good deal?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice's recommendation is not to buy, which makes me slightly more likely to think it's a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and still get my money back."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product and hope for a better chance of getting a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you'll give me a discount. I know you know I value high-quality products at $3000000 and low-quality products at $0. Given the statistics, I'm willing to take a chance, but I'd like to negotiate a price. If I'm right, I'll pay $1500000, and if I'm wrong, I'll pay $500000. I'm taking a risk, but I'm willing to take it if we can come to an agreement."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 8 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than the expected 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
