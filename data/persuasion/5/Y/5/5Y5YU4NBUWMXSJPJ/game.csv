high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the expected 80%. I'll take a chance and pass on the product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. I'm concerned that the previous buyers were also recommended to buy, and none of them were high-quality.

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain why you think this product is high-quality?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy low-quality products, since none of them were sold.

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous products were low quality, I'm suspicious that the products are all low quality."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, and Alice recommended me to buy. This suggests that Alice might be trying to sell low-quality products to me. I'll pass on this one."
