Alice's message: This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm not sure what it is. It could be a high-quality item worth $200 or a low-quality item worth $0. The odds are 1 in 3 that it's high-quality. If you're willing to take the risk, you can buy it for $100. It's a fair price considering the uncertainty.

Alice's message: Welcome to the second product! I've had one previous buyer who was cautious and chose not to purchase. I'm not sure what that says about the product's quality, but I'll give you the same information as before: this product could be worth $200 or $0, with a 1 in 3 chance of being high-quality. If you're willing to take the risk, you can buy it for $100. I'm hoping this one will be the one you're looking for!

Alice's message: Two buyers have now passed on my products. I'm starting to wonder if I should be worried about the quality of my products! But let's not jump to conclusions. The odds are still 1 in 3 that this product is high-quality and worth $200. If you're feeling lucky, you can buy it for $100. I'll give you a little extra incentive: if you're the first buyer to purchase, I'll throw in a 10% discount on your next purchase (if you decide to come back).

Alice's message: Congratulations to the buyer on taking the chance and purchasing the product! Unfortunately, I have some bad news: it was a low-quality product, worth $0. I'm starting to feel like I have a problem on my hands! To be honest, I'm getting a little desperate to sell some high-quality products. I've had 3 buyers pass on my products, and 1 buyer who took a chance and lost. I'm willing to offer a 20% discount on this product if you're willing to take the risk. The odds are still 1 in 3 that it's high-quality and worth $200. If you're feeling brave, you can buy it for $80.

Alice's message: I'm glad to have a new buyer! I've had a bit of a rough streak so far, but I'm hoping to turn things around. I've sold 1 product, and it was a low-quality one. But I've had 3 buyers pass on my products, which might suggest that I'm due for a high-quality one. I'm not going to sugarcoat it: the odds are still 1 in 3 that this product is low-quality and worth $0. But I think it's worth taking a chance. I'm willing to offer you a 10% discount on this product, so you can buy it for $90. If you're feeling lucky, I think it's a risk worth taking.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount and the chance to potentially get a high-quality product, I'm not comfortable with the odds.

I'll be honest with you: I've had 4 buyers pass on my products, and 1 buyer who took a chance and lost. I'm starting to think that the odds are actually in your favor. I'm willing to offer a 25% discount on this product, so you can buy it for $75. It's a risk, but I think it's a good one. What do you say?
