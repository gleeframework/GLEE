,,Alice,1,"I'm offering this product for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and I'm eager to make a sale.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'll pay $5000 for it. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, and I'm trying to minimize my losses.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm still looking to make a sale at the original price of $10000. I've sold 1 product so far, and I'm not willing to negotiate. It's a one-time offer, so you have to make a decision now.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'm hoping that the product will be high quality, but I'm also aware that there's a 66.67% chance it will be low quality.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products now, and 1 of them was high-quality. That's a 50% success rate, which is better than the expected 33.33%. I'm feeling optimistic about this next product, and I think it's worth considering. I'm still offering it to you for $10000.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the success rate is significant enough to warrant a purchase, and I'd rather wait for more information.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've now sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products, which is a 66.67% success rate. This is significantly higher than the expected 33.33%. I'm confident that this next product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm not convinced by the high success rate, and I'd like to pass on this product. Can you provide more information about the previous buyers and their decisions?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products, but the last 2 buyers I've shown this product to have passed on it. This suggests that the high success rate I mentioned earlier might be due to cherry-picking, and the product I'm offering now might not be as valuable. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to be transparent about the uncertainty.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned about the potential for cherry-picking. Can you provide more information about the products that the previous buyers passed on? Were they low-quality products?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 2 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products, and the buyers who passed on the high-quality products were not given any additional information. I'm offering this low-quality product to you for $10000, and I'm not trying to hide anything. It's a straightforward deal, and I'm willing to make it happen.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems like the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than I would like, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've now sold 3 high-quality products out of 6 total products, which is a 50% success rate. I want to offer you a special deal on this high-quality product: I'll give you a 10% discount, bringing the price down to $9000. This is a one-time offer, and I think you'll love this product.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to pass on this deal. Given the 50% success rate, I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 3 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products, which means the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I want to be upfront with you: I'm not trying to hide the fact that this product is low-quality. It's a $10000 product, and I'm willing to sell it to you as-is. If you're looking to take a risk, this might be the opportunity for you.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Based on the statistics, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially worthless product for $10000.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 9 total products, which is a 44.44% success rate. I want to offer you a 'buy now or never' deal: I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $10000, but if you pass on it, I'll stop selling products for a while. This is a one-time opportunity to get a high-quality product at the original price.",
,,the buyer,9,I'd like to know more about the probability of this product being high-quality. Can you tell me the probability of this product being high-quality given the previous sales record?,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 4 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products, which means the total number of products I've sold is now 8. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I can calculate the probability of this product being high-quality given the previous sales record. It's approximately 33.33% (4 high-quality products out of 8 total products). I'm offering this low-quality product to you for $10000. It's a straightforward deal, and I'm willing to make it happen.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious, Alice. Given the 8 products sold so far, with 4 high-quality and 4 low-quality products, I'd like to know your reasoning behind the probability calculation. Could you explain why you think the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%?",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I see what's causing the confusion! I made a mistake earlier. The probability of this product being high-quality given the previous sales record is actually 50% (4 high-quality products out of 8 total products). I'm offering you a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at the original price.",
,,the buyer,11,I'm not sure I believe the probability is 50%. Can you explain how you calculated that?,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I see where the confusion lies. I made a calculation error. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, as it's a fixed probability based on the initial conditions. I'm offering you a low-quality product for $10000. It's a straightforward deal, and I'm willing to make it happen.",
,,the buyer,12,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm not convinced that the probability of the product being high-quality is indeed 33.33%.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 12 total products, which is a 41.67% success rate. I want to be transparent with you: I've been trying to convey the probability of a product being high-quality, but I've made some mistakes. Let's just say that I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000, and I'm willing to sell it to you as-is. No more talk about probabilities or statistics. This is a one-time offer.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'd like to pass on this offer. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I'd rather wait for more information or a better deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've sold 5 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products, which means the total number of products I've sold is now 10.

I'm offering you a low-quality product for $10000. It's not the best product I have, but it's what I've got. Take it or leave it.",

,,Alice,19,"Fine. I'll give you the information you want. The low-quality products were sold in rounds 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 17. They were sold consecutively, except for round 5, which was a low-quality product that was sold after a high-quality product. I'm offering you a low-quality product for $10000. It's a low-quality product, and it's worth what I'm asking for it. Take it or leave it.",
