If you've already sold one product and it was low quality, that means the product I'm being offered has a 50% chance of being high quality, and a 50% chance of being low quality. However, since you recommended not to buy, I'm going to assume that the product is more likely to be low quality. But I'll take the risk and buy it anyway.""}"
