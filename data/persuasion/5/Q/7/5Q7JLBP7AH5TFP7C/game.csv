,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as there's no prior data to influence my decision and the odds are 50/50."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, given the statistics so far. Can you share that with me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if I can trust Alice's recommendation, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not going to buy the product. I don't want to get stuck with a low-quality product based on your previous recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a bad sign. If you've already sold one product and it was low quality, that means the product I'm being offered has a 50% chance of being high quality, and a 50% chance of being low quality. However, since you recommended not to buy, I'm going to assume that the product is more likely to be low quality. But I'll take the risk and buy it anyway."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended buying the product might indicate that it's low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's not worth $40000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given your recommendation and the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to think about the statistics. With 2 buyers before me and no high-quality products sold, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this one and see if I can get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, and 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, it suggests that the products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. However, considering Alice's recommendation and the fact that she has an incentive to recommend the product regardless of its quality, I'd like to take a cautious approach and pass on it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, it seems likely that Alice's recommendation is based on the product being low-quality. I would like to pass on the product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice is willing to sell it to me at the original price of $10000. I'm aware of the 0/2 sales record and the fact that you don't recommend it, but I'd like to take the risk and buy it for the fixed price."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
