I'd like to see more data or a more transparent recommendation process."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's the low-quality one and I'll get it for $10000, which is a good deal compared to the expected value of $15000 ($30000 * 0.5)"
