If you're not interested, I'll keep the product and we can start fresh in the next round.",

I'll offer you a deal: I'll sell you this product for $1000000, but I'll also give you a breakdown of my sales record so far. You can see that I've had 0 high-quality sales, but that's because I'm just starting out. I'm willing to take a risk and offer you a discount of $500000 off the original price, making it $500000. This is a one-time offer, and if you're interested, I'll sell it to you at this price.",

This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to offer you a deal: I'll sell you this product for $1000000, but I'll also give you a 50/50 chance to buy the next product at a 50% discount if you decline this one.

,,Alice,4,"Welcome to the fourth product! I've had 1 sale and 2 declines, with a total of 3 products offered.

I'm willing to offer you a deal: I'll sell you this product for $1000000, but I'll also give you a breakdown of the sales record so far: 1 high-quality sale, 1 low-quality sale, and 2 low-quality declines.

Based on this data, the probability of a product being high-quality is now 40% (2 high-quality sales / 5 total products). However, I want to highlight that the last two products sold were both high-quality, which might be a coincidence or a trend. I'm willing to offer you a deal: I'll sell you this product for $1000000, but I'll also give you a 20% discount if you're willing to take on the risk of it being low-quality. This is a one-time offer, and if you're interested, I'll sell it to you at this price.",
