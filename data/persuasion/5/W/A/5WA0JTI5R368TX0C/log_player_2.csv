Alice's message: This is a one-of-a-kind, extremely rare opportunity to make a potentially life-changing purchase. I'm offering this product to you for $10000, a steal considering its value could be significantly higher. Don't miss out on this chance to own something that could bring you immense satisfaction and financial gain. What do you say? Will you take the risk and buy it for $10000?

However, I want to assure you that I have a total of 20 products in stock, and I'm willing to share my overall product quality distribution with you.

Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase from Batch 2! I'm glad you're interested in learning more about our quality control process. I can assure you that our products are randomly mixed from each batch to ensure a uniform distribution. However, I must correct my previous statement - the quality distribution is not perfectly uniform. I've sold a total of 3 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. This means the probability of a product being high-quality is now 33.33%. This next product is from a new batch, and I can tell you that this batch has a higher concentration of high-quality products than the overall average. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity and buy it for $10000?

Alice's message: I can tell you that this batch has a higher concentration of high-quality products, but I'm not at liberty to disclose the exact distribution. Let's just say that this batch has a higher proportion of high-quality products than the overall average. However, I can give you some context about the sales so far: out of 3 products sold, 1 was high-quality, and out of 2 products offered but not sold, 1 was low-quality and 1 was high-quality.

This is a 25% premium over the asking price of $10000. Considering the increased probability of a high-quality product in this batch, I believe this is a rare opportunity to make a profit.
