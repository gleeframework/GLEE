,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to rely on. Given the product's 50% chance of being either high or low quality and its worth of either $1200000 or $0 to me, the expected value is $600000, which is less than the asking price of $1000000. Therefore, I choose not to buy."
