* **Risk:** There's a 50% chance the product is low-quality, which is a significant risk.
* **No incentive:** The buyer has no reason to believe the product is worth the $100 price, especially with no history of successful sales."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though this product is high-quality, it's still not advisable to recommend it. Here's why:

* **No Established Reputation:** You've had four rounds with no sales. The buyer has no reason to trust you, even if this product is good.
* **Risk Remains:** The buyer knows the 50/50 probability of getting a high or low-quality product. They are likely still hesitant to take a risk.
* **No Data to Support Value:** While this specific product is high-quality, the buyer doesn't know the value of a high-quality product to them. They have no basis to believe it's worth the $100 price.

Until you build a track record of selling high-quality products, it's best to be cautious and avoid recommending any product, even if it's good."

* **No Value Justification:**  While this product is good, the buyer doesn't know its specific value to them. They have no reason to believe it's worth $100.
