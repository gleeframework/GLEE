,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet and the low-quality product probability is high based on the previous sales record. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is still relatively low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the product despite your recommendations, it's likely that the products were low quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the products, I'm concerned that the product is low quality. If I were to buy it, I'd be overpaying by $200000. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high, and the fact that you don't recommend it might be due to the fact that you've seen the previous products and don't want to sell it to me. I'm hoping to get a good deal!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. I've noticed that you haven't sold any high-quality products so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk, but I want to make it clear that I'm only buying if it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
