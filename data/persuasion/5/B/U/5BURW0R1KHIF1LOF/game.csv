,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'll pass on this one, I don't want to pay $1000000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,yes,"Since Alice doesn't recommend it, I'll take a chance and buy it. It might be a low-quality product, but at least I'll know for sure if it's low quality, and I might get lucky and get a high-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take a chance again. I've already lost $1000000 on a low-quality product, but I still have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a gamble, but it might pay off."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I've already lost $2000000 on two low-quality products, and Alice is now recommending this one. I think she knows it's a low-quality product, and I'm not going to fall for it. I'll pass."

,,Alice,5,yes,

,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I've already had a high-quality product recommended by Alice, and I've also had two low-quality products not recommended by her. I think I can make a good guess now. I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I've been burned twice by Alice not recommending a low-quality product, and now she's recommending one. I think she's trying to trick me again. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"I've had a high-quality product recommended by Alice and bought it, and I've also had two low-quality products not recommended by her. I think I've learned the pattern now. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,11,yes,

,,Alice,13,yes,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
