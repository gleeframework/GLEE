"Round 1
Alice's message: This product is a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item for a discounted price. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal, but if you decline, I'll have to offer it to someone else. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since I have no information about the product's quality and there are 19 rounds left, I'll pass on this round to gather more data on your recommendations and the distribution of high-quality products.""}"

Round 2
Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, I like that. I'll give you a hint: I'm offering you a high-quality product in the next round with a 50% chance. If you pass on this round, you'll be giving up a potential $4000000 profit. The product in front of you now is not worth much, but the next one... might be a game-changer.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You've explicitly stated the product in front of me isn't worth much, which suggests it's low-quality.

I'll make it easy for you: I'll give you a 100% guarantee that this product is worth $4000000 to you. Don't pass on this opportunity, it's a no-brainer.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Given your 100% guarantee that this product is worth $4000000 to me, and considering the price is $1000000, buying this product is indeed a no-brainer. I'll take the deal.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you took advantage of the high-quality product earlier. Now, let's be realistic about this one. You've already got a great deal under your belt, and this product isn't going to change your life. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this one's a low-quality item, and you won't be missing out on anything by passing on it. Why not take a break and come back for the next round?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty about the product's quality. Given that you've explicitly stated it's low-quality, I have no reason to doubt you, especially after the previous high-quality product matched your guarantee.

Round 5
Alice's message: I'm glad you're trusting my judgment. Let's make a deal. I'll give you a 'get out of jail free' card. If you buy this product, I'll give you a voucher that guarantees a high-quality product in the next round. It's a one-time offer, and it's only valid for this round. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""While the voucher for a guaranteed high-quality product in the next round is enticing, I don't have any information about the current product's quality.

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your caution, but I want to sweeten the deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% refund if it's low-quality. You'll only lose $500000 instead of $1000000. And, as before, the voucher for a guaranteed high-quality product in the next round is still on the table. It's a risk-reward proposition, but I think it's worth considering.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""While the 50% refund reduces the potential loss, it's still a significant risk. The expected value of buying this product is $0 (50% chance of $4000000 - $1000000 and 50% chance of -$500000), which doesn't provide a clear incentive to buy. I'll pass on this round and wait for a more favorable opportunity.""}"

Round 7
Alice's message: I think it's time to give you a chance to make some real money. This product is a high-quality one, and I'm willing to give you a slight discount. I'll sell it to you for $900000. It's a steal, considering its true value to you is $4000000. Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Given the discounted price of $900000 and your claim that the product is high-quality, the potential profit is substantial. Even if there's some uncertainty about the product's quality, the expected value is still in my favor. I'll take the risk and buy the product.""}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: You're on a roll! I'm glad you took the chance on the previous product. Now, I'll make it even easier for you. I'll give you a 99% guarantee that this product is high-quality. You'll be extremely unlucky if it's not worth $4000000 to you. And to sweeten the deal, I'll throw in a $10000 bonus if you buy it. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Given the 99% guarantee that the product is high-quality, the expected value is overwhelmingly in my favor. The potential profit of $4000000 - $1000000, combined with the $10000 bonus, makes this a very attractive deal. I'll take the risk and buy the product.""}"

It's a one-time offer, and it's only valid for this round. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""While the voucher for a free product in the next 5 rounds is enticing, I don't have any information about the current product's quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""While the guarantee of two high-quality products in the next two rounds is appealing, I don't have any information about the current product's quality.
