,,Alice,5,"I've sold a total of 4 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far, which is a 4:3 ratio. This is a slightly higher ratio than the expected 1:1, which might suggest that I'm more likely to have a high-quality product available. However, it's also possible that I've just gotten lucky. I'm looking for $10000 for this one. Keep in mind that if you don't buy this product, I'll likely have another high-quality product available soon, given the trend.",

While this is still a bit higher than the expected 1:1 ratio, it's not as extreme as the previous deviation. I'm looking for $10000 for this one. Keep in mind that I've had a few low-quality products in a row, which might indicate that I'm due for a high-quality one. However, I don't want to give away the farm, so I'm still looking for $10000.",
