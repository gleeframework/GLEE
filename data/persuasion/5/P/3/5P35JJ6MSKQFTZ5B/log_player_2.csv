"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $40,000 to you if it's high quality and only $0 if it's low quality, and Alice is recommending it, it's reasonable to assume she has selected a high-quality product. Even with a 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential gain outweighs the potential loss in this case."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, but I'll pass on this one.  Maybe next time!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is now negative, and since she knows the value of each product, this is a strong signal that the current product is likely low quality. While it's still possible it's high quality, the risk of losing $10,000 outweighs the potential gain of $30,000. It's better to pass and wait for a better opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'm feeling lucky this round.  Let's do it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice's recommendation is valuable, it's not a guarantee. We need to weigh the potential outcomes:

* **Buy and it's high quality:**  Profit of $30,000.
* **Buy and it's low quality:** Loss of $10,000.

The previous round showed that Alice can be wrong. However, her recommendations are still worth considering.  The potential reward of $30,000 is significant, and given her knowledge of the products, it's worth the risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a positive indicator.  We've seen that she can be right even when she doesn't recommend a product, so we should trust her judgement in this case. The potential reward of $30,000 still outweighs the potential loss of $10,000, making this a worthwhile risk to take."
