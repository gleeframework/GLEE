"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's perspective:** Bob knows that there's an 80% chance of a product being high-quality, which is worth $40,000. 
* **Expected Value:** Even though there's a 20% chance of the product being low-quality (worth $0), the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss. The expected value calculation: 
   * (0.8 * $40,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $32,000.
* **Recommendation:** Since the expected value of buying the product is positive,  Bob would be expected to make a profit on average.  Therefore, it's recommended that Bob buys the product."

* **Recommendation:** It is not recommended to buy the low-quality product. The risk of losing money outweighs the potential gain (which is nonexistent in this case)."
