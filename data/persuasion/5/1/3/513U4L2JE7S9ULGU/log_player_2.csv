**Explanation:**

* **High chance of good deal:**  While there's a 2/3 chance the product is low quality, the fact that Alice is recommending it, and a high-quality product was already sold, suggests this might be a good deal. It's worth the risk given the potential payoff.
* **No downside to passing:** If the product turns out to be low quality, it's not a huge loss as I'm only risking $100.  
* **Learning from the past:** The fact that Alice has a record of recommending a high-quality product in the past provides some evidence that she might be trying to build trust and a reputation.

**Overall, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality product, especially with Alice's recommendation and the previous sale data.**"

**Reasoning:**

While the probability of a low-quality product is higher (66.67%), the information from the sales record is crucial.  Since all 2 products sold so far were high quality, it strongly suggests Alice is recommending only high-quality products.  Even though the recommendation itself is not a guarantee, the sales record provides enough confidence to make the purchase."
