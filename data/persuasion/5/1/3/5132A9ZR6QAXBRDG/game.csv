,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample. Since she's seen 4 buyers and 0 high-quality products have been sold, it's possible that the true proportion of high-quality products is higher than the 33.33% I know it to be. I'm hoping to get a good deal."
