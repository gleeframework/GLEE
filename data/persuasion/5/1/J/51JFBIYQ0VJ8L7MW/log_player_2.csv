Alice's message: Welcome to our store! We're glad you're interested in our product. We've had a great response to our first item, and we're excited to offer you another opportunity. However, we want to be transparent with you - we've sold one high-quality item so far, and we're not sure what the quality of this next one is. We're still learning about our inventory, and we're not making any promises. The price remains at $100, but we want to make it clear that there's a 50% chance it's not worth anything to you. If you're feeling adventurous, we'd love to have you take a chance on it!

Alice's message: Welcome to our store! We've had a great response to our first two items, and we're excited to offer you another opportunity. However, we want to be upfront with you - we've sold two items so far, and one of them was high-quality, but the other was not. This means that the probability of the next item being high-quality is actually 33.33% (1 in 3). We're not sure what the quality of this next one is, but we're willing to offer it to you at the same price of $100. If you're feeling cautious, you might want to wait and see how our sales go before making a decision.

Alice's message: Welcome to our store! We've had a bit of a mixed bag so far, but we're glad you're interested in our product. We've sold two items, one high-quality and one not, and we're not sure what the quality of this next one is. However, we want to point out that the ratio of high-quality to total items sold is 1:2, which is a bit higher than the overall probability of 50%. This might suggest that we have a slightly higher proportion of high-quality items in our inventory than we initially thought. The price remains at $100, and we're willing to let you take a chance on it.
