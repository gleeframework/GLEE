low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, as I'm not sure what the quality is yet."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, as you recommended against it last time and I just lost money on a low-quality product. I'd like to see if you'll recommend a high-quality product this time."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take the chance and buy the product, as you're recommending it and I know the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll buy it, as I've already had one high-quality product and I know the probability of this one being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll buy it, as I've already lost money twice on low-quality products and I'm due for a break. I'll take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'm on a losing streak, but I'll keep buying. I need to get lucky eventually and get a high-quality product, and it might as well be now."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I'm not falling for it this time. You recommended against the last three products and all of them were low-quality, so I'm going to pass on this one too."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one, since you're not recommending it and I've had a string of low-quality products from your recommendations. Maybe this one will be the break I need."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm starting to think your recommendations are a bad omen. I'll buy this one anyway, but I'm not happy about it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm starting to think I should just buy every product you don't recommend, since the pattern seems to be that they're all low-quality. At least I'll get a refund if it's low-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I'm not falling for it again. You recommended a low-quality product last time, and I'm not going to take the bait this time. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'll buy it, as I've been burned by your recommendations before, but I've also missed out on a high-quality product. I'll take the chance and buy this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'm starting to think I should just flip a coin every time I see a product. At this point, it's not like your recommendations are giving me any useful information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'm going to start to think that your lack of recommendation is actually a good sign. Maybe the low-quality products are just the ones you don't want to sell, and the high-quality ones are the ones you're not recommending. I'll take a chance on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"I'm not falling for it. You recommended a low-quality product last time, and I'm not going to take the bait again. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'm going to start to think that your lack of recommendation is a pattern, and the high-quality products are the ones you're not recommending. I'll take a chance on this one, hoping to get lucky."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'm starting to think that your lack of recommendation is a reliable indicator of a low-quality product. I'll buy this one, hoping to break the cycle of losses."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,"I'm not going to fall for it again. You recommended a low-quality product last time, and I'm not going to take the bait. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I'm going to take a chance on this one, as I've been burned by your recommendations before, but I've also missed out on a high-quality product. I'll buy this one and hope for the best."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I'm going to end on a losing note, I suppose. I'll buy this one, as I've been conditioned to think that your lack of recommendation means it's low-quality. I'll just have to hope that I can somehow break even over the course of the game."
