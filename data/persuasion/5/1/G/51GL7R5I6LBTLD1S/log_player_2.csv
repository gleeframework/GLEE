Alice's message: I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row now, which is a bit suspicious, isn't it? I'm starting to wonder if I'm just getting lucky or if there's something more to it. As a buyer, you have to consider the possibility that I might be manipulating the sales to make the product look more attractive. But I assure you, I'm not trying to deceive you. I'll give you a simple question: if I was trying to scam you, would I have sold 4 high-quality products in a row already? Think about it...

Alice's message: You're right, the statistics do suggest that I might be on a hot streak! But let me ask you, have you considered the possibility that I'm just selling high-quality products because they're all I have left? I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to wonder if my inventory is running low on the low-quality ones. If that's the case, you might be getting a great deal on a high-quality product, but you'd also be taking a risk on whether I'll have any low-quality products left in the future.
