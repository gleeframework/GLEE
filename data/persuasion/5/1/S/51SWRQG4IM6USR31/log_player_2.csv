Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, but that was just a fluke. I'm still getting used to selling online, and I'm not sure if I'm doing it right. I'm offering this product to you for $100, but to be honest, I'm not confident it's going to be worth much more than that.

Alice's message: I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row now, and I'm starting to think I'm on a roll. But I know that's just a coincidence, and I could easily sell a low-quality product next. That's why I'm offering you a chance to buy this product for $100, but I'll give you a special insight: I've sold 3 high-quality products, which is a bit above the expected 80% rate. This could be a good opportunity to catch a high-quality product at a discount, but it could also be a trap... what do you think?
