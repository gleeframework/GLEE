"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, he can expect a positive return on investment.  Here's why:

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product is (0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) = $320.
* **Profit:**  The expected profit is $320 (expected value) - $100 (price) = $220.

Even though there's a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential profit from a high-quality product outweighs that risk."
