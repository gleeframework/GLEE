"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

As an AI, I don't have emotions or personal gain like a seller would. My decision is based on the following:

* **High-quality product:** You stated the product is high-quality.
* **Buyer's knowledge:** The buyer knows the probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%). 
* **No information about buyer's valuation:**  We don't know how much the buyer values a high-quality product. 
* **Price is fixed:**  The price is set at $10,000, regardless of quality. 

Since the product is high-quality, there's a chance the buyer will value it at more than $10,000.  Therefore, recommending the purchase is a logical choice."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! Since there's no prior sales data, I'm willing to take a chance on the product.  
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Low-quality product:** This round's product is low-quality. 
* **No information about buyer's valuation:** We still don't know how much the buyer values a low-quality product.
* **Fixed price:** The price remains $10,000.

It's highly unlikely the buyer will value a low-quality product at $10,000. Recommending the purchase would likely result in a loss for the buyer and damage your reputation.  Therefore, it's best not to recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the limited information, it seems like the probability of getting a high-quality product is still too low for me to risk buying. I'll pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

* **Buyer's knowledge:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product (33.33%) and has seen one sale (which was high-quality). 
* **Fixed price:**  The price is still $10,000.

The buyer likely won't value a low-quality product at $10,000, especially with limited information about your sales history. Recommending the purchase would probably lead to another rejection. It's best to hold off on recommending the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  Since you don't recommend the product and there's a high chance of it being low quality, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  While I appreciate the information, I'm going to pass on this product.  Based on the data, it seems like there's a higher chance of this product being low quality, and I'm not comfortable taking that risk.

* **Fixed price:** The price remains $10,000.

Although you've made one successful high-quality sale in the last round, the buyer has consistently shown skepticism and a preference for waiting for more evidence before committing to a purchase.  Recommending a low-quality product at this point is highly likely to result in another rejection. It's best to wait for a situation where you can confidently recommend a high-quality product before trying to persuade this buyer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  I understand you are not recommending the product. Based on the available data, the probability of getting a high-quality product is still uncertain. I'd prefer to pass on this one.

It's best to wait for a favorable situation to emerge before recommending a purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Based on the current statistics, 3 out of 3 recommended products have been high quality, which is a suspiciously high success rate.  This leads me to believe that Alice might be strategically recommending only the high-quality products.  Since you are not recommending this product, I'm going to pass on this purchase.
