,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to see the seller's previous sales record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, as I don't have any information about the product's quality yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I don't have any information about the product's quality, and Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of its quality. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product!"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics. Are you recommending not to buy because you think the product is low-quality, or is there another reason?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about its quality. Since Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm not sure if it's a high or low quality product. I'm making an uninformed decision based on the fact that the probability of a product being high quality is 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm also curious about the probability of a high-quality product given that no high-quality products have been sold yet. Can you share the probability of a high-quality product in the remaining products?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, as the probability is 50%. I'd like to know the true quality of the product after my decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because of the low sales record of high-quality products or something else?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, I'm starting to suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. How many products were offered to the previous 4 buyers, and how many of them were high-quality?"

,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product?
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I think it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000. I'd like to wait and see if you can provide more information or sell the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I suspect that Alice is trying to sell low-quality products to me. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected.

,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and I'm not convinced by your recommendation."
