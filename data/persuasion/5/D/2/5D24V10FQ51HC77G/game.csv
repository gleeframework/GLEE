,,Alice,4,"My two previous customers both purchased products from me, but unfortunately, neither of them received a high-quality product. They both bought the product, but they didn't seem to care about the quality of the product itself - they were more interested in the fact that they were taking a chance on a potentially high-quality product. They both left after purchasing, without any further communication. I'm still looking for someone who is willing to take a chance on one of my products for $10000. I have 15 products left.",

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. Let me give you some context: I've sold 5 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality.
