**Explanation:**

* **The Sales Record is Positive:**  The sales record shows a high proportion of high-quality products sold (4 out of 5). This suggests a strong likelihood that Alice is genuinely recommending good products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is also a significant factor. While her knowledge of the product's quality is limited, she is likely to be more informed than us as a seller.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product ($1,250,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0), especially given the positive sales record and Alice's recommendation."
