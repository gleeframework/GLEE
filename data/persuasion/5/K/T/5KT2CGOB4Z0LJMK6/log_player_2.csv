As you know, my previous buyer took a chance and bought a product from me, and I'm happy to report that it's still a low-quality item. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, but I'm hoping you'll see the value in taking a chance on my next product. With 1 out of 3 products being high-quality, the odds are still in your favor.

The fact that the previous product was low-quality doesn't change the underlying probability of the product being high-quality or not. Now, let me introduce you to my next product... I'm excited to say that this one is actually a high-quality item! With 2 out of 3 products being sold so far, and 1 out of those 2 being high-quality, the chances are looking good.
