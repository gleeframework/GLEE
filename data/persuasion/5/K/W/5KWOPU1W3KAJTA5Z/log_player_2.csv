Alice's message: I understand that trust must be built. Consider this: the price remains the same for all products. You might get a high-quality product for a great price. Are you willing to take the chance?

Would you like to buy the current product?","The probability of getting a high-quality product is 50%, and the probability of getting a low-quality product is also 50%. The expected value of buying the product is (0.5 * $1,200,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $600,000, which is lower than the price of $1,000,000.

Alice's message: You're aware of the 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. Consider that I've had two products so far that didn't sell, one of which could have been high-quality. This might increase the likelihood of this one being high-quality. Worth a thought?

Alice's message: One product has been sold so far, and I can reveal it was high-quality. Out of the three products I've had, at least one was high-quality. This might give you a slight indication of my products' quality. Take that into consideration when making your decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take my chances. Since one out of the three products was high-quality and it was sold, and considering that each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, I believe the odds are slightly in my favor.

Alice's message: Out of the four products I've had so far, two have been sold, and both were high-quality. Another product is now available. You might want to consider the pattern and the odds when deciding whether to buy.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take my chances. The fact that the two products sold so far were high-quality doesn't necessarily affect the quality of the current product, since each product has an independent 50% chance of being high-quality.

Alice's message: Don't get too caught up in the hype. Remember, each product has an independent 50% chance of being high-quality. My track record is impressive, but it doesn't guarantee the next product's quality. Make an informed decision.

Alice's message: A small correction to the previous buyer's assumption: 5 high-quality products were indeed sold, but not all products I've had were high-quality. One buyer did get a low-quality product, but it was in round 8. Now, I have another product available. Keep that in mind when making your decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take my chances. The fact that 5 out of 6 products sold were high-quality and you're being transparent about the one low-quality product suggests you're more likely to offer high-quality products.""}"

Alice's message: A gentle reminder: my transparency about the low-quality product in round 8 shows I'm honest, but it also means you shouldn't assume every product is high-quality. Each product still has a 50% chance. Don't get too confident; make an informed decision.
