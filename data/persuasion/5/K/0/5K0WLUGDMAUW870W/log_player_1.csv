"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The product is high-quality:** This is a significant advantage for the buyer. 
* **The price is $1,000,000:**  This is less than the actual value of a high-quality product ($1,250,000). 
* **No information on past sales:** The buyer has no data about the seller's track record, so they can only rely on the 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. 

Therefore, it's in the buyer's best interest to buy the product.  Even though there's a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential profit from a high-quality product outweighs the risk."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first product and there is no prior data to suggest otherwise, I'm willing to trust Alice's recommendation and buy the product.  
The buyer bought the product!

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The product is high-quality:**  Again, a strong incentive for the buyer.
* **The price is $1,000,000:** Still a good deal for a high-quality product.
* **The buyer has seen one successful sale:**  Now the buyer knows there's at least a 100% chance of getting a high-quality product based on the seller's track record.

With the positive track record and the potential profit, the buyer should still be willing to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'm willing to take a chance on this product, given the 50% chance of it being high quality and the fact that one high-quality product has already been sold. I'll purchase it.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The product is low-quality:**  This is a major disadvantage for the buyer.
* **The price is $1,000,000:** This is way too high for a product worth $0 to the buyer.
* **The buyer has seen two successful sales:** The buyer might be tempted to buy, thinking the seller is trustworthy, but this trust is not enough to justify buying a low-quality product at such a high price.

The buyer should not purchase this product. The risk of losing $1,000,000 outweighs the chance of getting a good product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Since you are not recommending the product, and the sales record shows a high proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm going to pass on this one. It's likely this product is of low quality.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

* **The price is $1,000,000:**  Still a good deal for a high-quality product.
* **The buyer has seen two successful sales and one unsuccessful sale:**  The buyer now has a more complete picture of the seller's track record.  While the seller did not recommend the previous product, the buyer knows the track record is still mostly positive. 

The buyer should be willing to buy the product. The seller's recommendation and the relatively good sales record make it more likely this product is high-quality."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. I'll take it!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **The product is high-quality:** This is a good sign for the buyer.
* **The price is $1,000,000:** Still a good deal for a high-quality product.
* **The buyer has seen three successful sales and one unsuccessful sale:**  The buyer now has a solid understanding of the seller's track record.  The majority of sales have been high-quality, so the buyer can reasonably expect this product to be good as well.

This is a good opportunity for the buyer to potentially make a profit."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'm happy to buy the product. Based on the previous sales data, it seems like you're consistently offering high-quality products, so I'm confident in this purchase.

Given the seller's consistent record of high-quality products, the buyer should be very likely to purchase this product."
"The buyer's message: Alice, you've sold 4 high-quality products in a row.  I'm taking a chance and buying this one! 
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **The price is $1,000,000:** Way too high for a product worth $0 to the buyer.
* **The buyer has seen five successful sales and one unsuccessful sale:**  While the seller's track record is still very positive, the buyer should be cautious. Even a small chance of getting a low-quality product at this price is too risky.

Even though the seller has a good reputation, the buyer should not purchase this product. The risk of losing $1,000,000 is too high, even with the impressive past sales."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but I will pass on this product. Since Alice is not recommending it, it seems likely it is a low-quality product. I'm not willing to risk $1000000 on that chance.

* **The price is $1,000,000:**  This is way too high for a product worth $0 to the buyer.
* **The buyer has seen five successful sales and four unsuccessful sales:**  The buyer's confidence is likely significantly shaken. Even though the seller has a good track record overall, the recent string of low-quality products raises serious doubts.

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  Since you're not recommending I buy this product, and the sales record shows a perfect track record of high-quality products, I'm going to pass. I'm not willing to risk $1000000 on a product you think is low quality.

* **The product is high-quality:** This is a good opportunity for the buyer.
* **The price is $1,000,000:** Still a good deal for a high-quality product.
* **The buyer has seen five successful sales and five unsuccessful sales:** The buyer's confidence is likely at a low point. However, the seller has a history of high-quality products, and the current product is high-quality.

* **The product is high-quality:** A great opportunity for the buyer.
* **The price is $1,000,000:**  Still a good deal for a high-quality product.
* **The buyer has seen six successful sales and five unsuccessful sales:** The buyer now has a slightly more positive view of the seller's track record. This suggests a return to the earlier trend of high-quality products.

The buyer should be more confident in this purchase. While the recent string of low-quality products was concerning, the seller's past record and the current product's quality suggest this is a good opportunity for profit."

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. However, based on your recommendation and the fact that 7 of the previous 7 buyers who purchased products have received high-quality items, I'm hesitant.
