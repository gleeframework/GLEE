Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure what I'd gain from inspecting the product, and even if it's high-quality, I'd still have to pay $100 for it. I'll wait for the next round.""}"

Alice's message: Ah-ha! I've got a good one this time! I know you've been hesitant so far, but this product is the real deal. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a steal considering its true value is $120. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll be missing out on a great opportunity.

If you buy this one, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at the same price you paid for the high-quality product in round 6, which was $90.
