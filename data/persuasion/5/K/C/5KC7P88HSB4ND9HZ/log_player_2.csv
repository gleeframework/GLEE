"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though there's a 50% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 

This strategy is based on the expected value calculation:

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.5 * $12,500) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,250**

Since the expected value is positive, it's generally advantageous to buy."

```

**Reasoning:**

The previous round's outcome doesn't change the inherent probabilities for this round.  Each product still has a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality.  The expected value calculation remains the same, making it advantageous to buy."
