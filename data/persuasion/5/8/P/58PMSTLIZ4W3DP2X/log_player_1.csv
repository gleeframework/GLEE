I understand your skepticism, and I want to provide more context. If I were selling low-quality products, I'd expect to have sold more of them by now.

I'd put it at around 55-60%. However, this one is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount.

However, I've been trying to be too optimistic, and I think I've been overestimating the probability of the recent streak being representative of the overall probability. If I were to recalculate the probability based on the overall data, I'd say it's actually around 85%. I'm willing to offer you this product at the original price of $10,000, but I'll throw in a guarantee: if this product is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and offer you a chance to buy another product at a discounted price.
