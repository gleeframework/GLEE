{""decision"": ""no""}

Alice has a 50% chance of having a high-quality product, but this is still a gamble for the buyer. The buyer has seen Alice refuse to recommend two previous low-quality products. This could indicate that Alice is being honest about her products, but it could also mean she's just being cautious about her reputation.  With no positive data points, it's still more likely that the product is low-quality. The buyer is better off waiting for more information before making a decision."

This lack of data makes it too risky for the buyer to purchase, even though the product is high-quality. The buyer is better off waiting for more information to establish a pattern before making a decision."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but I'm going to pass on this one. Since this is the first product, there's no historical data to help me make a decision. And since you're not recommending it, I'm not comfortable taking the risk.
