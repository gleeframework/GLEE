"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, the expected value of buying the product is:

* 0.8 * $20,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $16,000.

This is greater than the price of $10,000, making it a good deal for Bob. Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob knows the product is high-quality 80% of the time, he doesn't know the quality of this specific product. Since this round's product is actually high-quality, the expected value calculation from the previous round still applies:

* 0.8 * $20,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $16,000.

This is greater than the price of $10,000, so recommending the purchase remains the best strategy."

Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.

Therefore, the expected value calculation remains the same:

* 0.8 * $20,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $16,000.

This is still greater than the price of $10,000, so recommending the purchase is the best course of action."

While the expected value of buying the product remains:

This is greater than the price of $10,000. However, we know that this specific product is **low-quality**.  Therefore, recommending the purchase would lead to Bob losing $10,000. It's crucial to remember that the expected value is an average, and in this specific case, the outcome is guaranteed to be negative for Bob."
