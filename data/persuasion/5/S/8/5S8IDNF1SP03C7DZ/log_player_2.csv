Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she has seen 3 previous buyers who bought the product, but she doesn't know the quality of the products they received. If the first 3 products were all low-quality, she might recommend buying the 4th product to try to get a high-quality one. However, if the first 3 products were all high-quality, she would have no reason to recommend buying the 4th product. Therefore, I think there is a 50% chance that the product I receive is high-quality and a 50% chance that it's low-quality, and I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000 for a 50% chance of getting a $2,000,000 product.""
