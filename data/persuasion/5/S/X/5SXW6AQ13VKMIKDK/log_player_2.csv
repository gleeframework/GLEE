Alice's message: Ah, the 25% chance of getting a low-quality product is a risk, I won't deny it. But let me put it this way: my low-quality products are... let's say, 'character-building' experiences. They're not worthless, exactly. They're just... experiences. And at $100, it's a small price to pay for the chance to have an experience. Plus, think of it as an investment in your own personal growth. You'll learn to appreciate the value of a high-quality product, and you'll be even more discerning in your purchasing decisions. Trust me, it's worth it!
