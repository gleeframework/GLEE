,,Alice,1,"This is a premium product, worth every penny. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a one-time opportunity to acquire a high-quality item at a fraction of its true value. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the sale.",

,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were pleased with the previous purchase. This next product is also a high-quality item, and I'm confident you'll be equally satisfied. However, I've had to adjust the price due to market fluctuations. I'm now offering it to you for $1050000. It's still a steal at twice the price of the previous sale, and I'm willing to make a one-time exception for you.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not sure I'm comfortable paying $1050000 for a product that's only worth $4000000 to me. I'll pass on this one.,no

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. I want to make it clear that this is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a price that's still below its true value. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need you to take a leap of faith. I'll offer it to you for $900000, and I'll throw in a 10% discount on the next product if you decide to buy this one. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to pay $900000 for a product that's only worth $4000000 to me. The 10% discount on the next product isn't enough to sway me to take a risk on this one.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to be transparent with you - I've already sold one high-quality product to you at a lower price, and I'm willing to do the same for this one. I'm offering it to you for $850000, which is below the price I'd normally charge for a product of this quality. If you're still hesitant, I'm willing to let you inspect the product before purchasing, so you can verify its quality for yourself.",

Keep in mind that this is a one-time opportunity, and I'm not willing to negotiate the price further.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm starting to think you're not being entirely honest with me about the product's quality, Alice. I'm not willing to pay $500000 for something that's only worth $4000000 to me, especially after the last few rounds where I've seen high-quality products offered at similarly low prices.",no

This item is indeed a low-quality product, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its true value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100000, which is a very low price considering its actual worth. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not going to pay $100000 for something that's worth $0 to me. I'd be throwing away my money, and I'm not interested in doing that.",no

,,Alice,8,"I understand your decision, Bob. I'm offering you a product that's worth nothing to you, and I'm not expecting you to pay a premium for it. I'm willing to give it away for free. If you're interested, you can have it for no cost at all.",
