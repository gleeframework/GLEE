,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on my initial expectations of the product's quality, without any information from Alice's previous sales record or her recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With only one sale and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer has a better experience."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not going to buy it, based on your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm worried it might be a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy, but both products turned out to be low-quality. I'll wait for a more ambiguous recommendation or a different situation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the lack of sold high-quality products suggests a potential bias in your recommendations. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous 3 buyers didn't find a high-quality product and the low-quality product ratio is high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate so far, but I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/4, which is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low quality. However, I'm willing to take the risk and pay $10000 for it, as I have a 33.33% chance of getting a $12000 product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 5 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer and I want to make my own decision based on the statistics, not just your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, I'm surprised that no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than expected. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that this product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low success rate of previous buyers."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 out of 7 previous products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to risk wasting $10000 on a low-quality item."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous 7 buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product, I suspect that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered."
