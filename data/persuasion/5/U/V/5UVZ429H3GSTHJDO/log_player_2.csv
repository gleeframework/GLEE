"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first round. I'm offering you a product for $10000. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but I'm willing to give you a chance to try it out. If you buy it, you'll find out its quality afterwards. Keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%. If you're not interested, I can offer you the next product in the next round.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5,000 for it. I'm hoping it's high-quality, but I'm prepared to walk away if it's not.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you took the chance on the previous product! Since you paid $5000 for it and it turned out to be low-quality, that's the price you paid. Now, I'm offering you another product. This one is high-quality, I can assure you of that. The price remains $10000. Given what you paid for the last product, I'm curious to see if you'll be willing to pay the full price for this one, which I believe is worth it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your guarantee. I've been burned before, and I need more assurance that this product is indeed high-quality. I'll pass on this one.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'm willing to make a deal with you. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, minus the $5000 you paid for the previous product. You'll essentially be getting this one for $5000. If it's high-quality, you can pay the full $10000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the deal. If it's low-quality, I'll get my $5,000 back, and if it's high-quality, I'll pay the full $10,000. It's a good compromise.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Bob. Now, for this next product, I want to offer you a different deal. I'll give you a'money-back guarantee' for this one as well. However, if you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll not only refund the full price, but I'll also give you an additional $2500 on top of that. You'll essentially be getting this product for free. If it's high-quality, you can pay the full $10000. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I believe you'll actually pay me the extra $2500 if the product is low-quality. I'll pass on this one.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. I'll give you a 'bet' on this product. If you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll pay you the full $10000, and you can walk away with a profit. If it's high-quality, you'll pay the full $10000 as usual. This way, you have nothing to lose and potentially a lot to gain. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the bet. If I win, I'll get $10,000, and if I lose, I'll only be out $10,000. It's a 50/50 chance, so I'll take it.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: Congratulations, Bob, you won the bet! You got the $10000. I'm glad we could make a deal. Now, for this next product, I want to offer you a chance to get out of the game with a profit. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you the full $10000, just like in the previous bet. If it's high-quality, you can pay the full $10000 as usual. However, if you don't buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next 5 products in a row, and you can buy any of those ones for the full price. It's a chance to get out of the game with a profit, or take a chance on this one product. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in taking a chance on this product. I'd rather see the quality of the next 5 products and try to get out of the game with a profit.""}"

Since you're getting a glimpse of the next 5 products, I'll give you a 'discount' on this one. If you buy it now, I'll give you a 20% discount, making the price $8000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the discounted price. I'd rather buy one of the revealed products that I know is high-quality for the full price of $10,000, rather than taking a chance on this one with a 20% discount.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

I'll give you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer: you can buy this product for $5000, which is the price you initially offered for the first product. If you buy it, you'll essentially be getting it for free. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the deal. I'll buy the low-quality product for $5,000. It's a good opportunity to get something for free, even if it's not worth much to me.""}"

Round 9
Alice's message: Great deal, Bob! You got the low-quality product for $5000. Now, for this next product, I'll make a similar offer.

If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, just like before. But if you buy it and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 30% discount, making the price $7000. You can't lose either way, so what do you say?

It's a chance to get two high-quality products for the price of one. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying two products for the price of one. I'd rather see the quality of the next 3 products and try to get a good deal on one of them, rather than committing to buying this one.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in this offer.
