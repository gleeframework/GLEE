Alice's message: Ahaha, great question! Based on the stats, I can tell you that the probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33%. That's right, one in three chance it's a high-quality product! With that in mind, I'm still confident that this one is worth the investment. I'm offering it to you for the same price of $10000.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns! You're right, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far does make you wonder if the probability of low-quality products is higher. Let me put your mind at ease. The probability of this product being low-quality is indeed higher than 66.67%, but only slightly. With 2 low-quality products out of 8 total products, the probability of this one being low-quality is around 75%. However, I'm still convinced that this one is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000. What do you think? Will you take a chance on this potentially high-quality product?

Given the information you provided, I think the probability of this product being low-quality is indeed higher than 66.67%.

I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm also curious - how many more products do you have available, and are you willing to reveal the quality of the next product if I decide to pass on this one?""

Alice's message: I completely understand! I appreciate your caution, and I'm glad you're willing to take a chance on the next one. As for the probability, I'm using a weighted average of the actual results so far, which is indeed higher than the initial 33.33%. With 1 high-quality product out of 9 total products, the current probability of a product being high-quality is around 10.53%. I'm willing to share this information with you, and I'm confident that this next product has a good chance of being high-quality. However, I must remind you that the probability of it being low-quality is still quite high. I'm offering it to you for the same price of $10000. What do you think?
