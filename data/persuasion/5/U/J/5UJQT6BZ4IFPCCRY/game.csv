,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'll need to know its quality after the purchase to understand your recommendation method."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned that the recommendation might be biased towards the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product. Can you provide more information about the previous buyer's purchase, such as the quality of the product they bought and how you arrived at your recommendation for me?"

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the quality of the product first before making a decision. I'd also like to see the updated statistics on the sales record.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of the first 2 products were high-quality, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80.00%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'd like to know more about the statistics. How many total products have been sold so far, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total sold?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I would like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the products after Alice's recommendation, I'm concerned that Alice may be biased towards recommending high-quality products. I'd like to wait and see if Alice's recommendation holds up to scrutiny when the next buyer is presented with a low-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products sold were high-quality, which is suspiciously high. I'd like to see a more balanced distribution before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm assuming that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is higher than 80.00% because two high-quality products have been sold already, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 100.00%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the product, I suspect that Alice is recommending low-quality products to buyers who are likely to pass, which might indicate a higher probability of the current product being low-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, I think the probability of it being high quality is lower than the average so far"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the statistics on the first three buyers who purchased the products. What were the recommendations given to them, and did they end up buying the products?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by her not knowing the value of the product to me, and I'd like to wait for more information."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 3 high-quality products sold out of 3 attempts, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the stated 80.00%. I'm going to take a chance and pass."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products were high-quality, I'm concerned that this might be a selection bias and the product I'm offered might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is offered to me."
