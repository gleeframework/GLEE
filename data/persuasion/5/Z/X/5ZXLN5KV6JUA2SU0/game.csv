high-quality,120.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that I have no information about its quality yet. I'm buying based on the recommendation and the fact that there are no prior sales data to influence my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because you don't recommend it, not because of the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product and I'll get it for $0, but I'm also aware that it might be high-quality and I'll pay $100 for it. I'm taking a risk, but I'm willing to take it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total products sold so far, and the number of products that were discarded before I was offered the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be the only high-quality product left."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think the recommendation is biased towards encouraging buyers to purchase, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on your past recommendations, and the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and Alice's recommendation is against buying it. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't give me confidence in its quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased because she has a self-interest in selling the product. If I buy the product and it's low quality, she'll get to keep the $100, but if I pass and it's low quality, she'll have to discard it. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling high-quality products, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product at $100."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she has sold 1 high-quality product out of 6, which is a relatively low proportion. This suggests that the remaining products may be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious about the previous sales record. Can you tell me more about the 6 buyers who purchased the products? How many of them got high-quality products, and how many got low-quality products? Also, what's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you provide that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold is low, or is there another reason?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. With 1 high-quality product out of 6 sold, I'd like to see the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product."
