,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, but I don't have enough information to make an informed decision yet. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to estimate the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the first buyer, and I think it's around 66.67%.

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice is recommending high-quality products to the first two buyers to make them buy, so the fact that she's recommending this one to me suggests it's probably low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be high quality since the previous two products were low quality."

,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are based on the quality of the product. Since Alice is recommending me to pass on the product as well, I'm going to trust her recommendation and pass on the product."
