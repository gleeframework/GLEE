low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, and I'm willing to take a chance on the first product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm trying to break the trend and see if I can get a high-quality product, despite your recommendation."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality, which is a 100% chance of a low-quality product. I'm going to pass on this product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that Alice recommended it, which might indicate it's a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Given that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, and I'd like to contribute to the data by buying it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of its quality. I'm hoping to catch a high-quality product, and the fact that none have been sold so far suggests there may be a higher proportion of low-quality products remaining."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, as the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67% and the potential reward for a high-quality product is high ($400)."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the statistics, not on your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and that 5 out of 5 products sold so far have been low quality, which suggests a potential bias in your recommendations. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were discouraged from buying, I'm suspicious that the products offered so far are likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the low-quality products have been overrepresented in the previous sales, so I'm trying to correct the sample."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 9 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data or a different recommendation before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I will pass on it. Given the statistics that 9 out of 9 products sold were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality as well. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality, based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. This suggests that the product might be low quality, which would be a good opportunity for me to buy it at the discounted price of $100."
