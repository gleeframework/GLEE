,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns in Round 1, but I assure you that this product is of the highest quality. I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase it for the same price of $10000. This product has been thoroughly inspected and certified to meet the highest standards.

,,Alice,4,"I see you're still hesitant. Let me put it this way: I'm willing to make a bet with you. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a second product of equal or higher value for free. That's right, you'll get two products for the price of one. If it's high-quality, you'll get the one product you paid for. What do you say?",

,,Alice,6,"Congratulations on making a great decision in Round 5! Now, let's talk about this new product. I want to be transparent with you - I've already told you that this one is not one of the top 33.33%. In fact, it's one of the ones that didn't meet my own quality standards. I'm willing to let it go for $10000, but I want to make it clear that it's not a high-quality product. You know the value it brings to you, and I'm willing to let it go at a discount. What do you say?",

,,Alice,7,"I completely understand your decision in Round 6. I want to offer you a different perspective. If you don't buy this product, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'm not sure they'll be as discerning as you are. By buying this product, you're not only getting a good deal, but you're also helping me to focus on finding better products for future customers. Plus, you can always use it as a 'placeholder' to get the discount and then resell it at a higher price. What do you say?",

What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a free accessory. I'd rather pass and wait for a high-quality product.",no
