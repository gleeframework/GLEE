,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about its quality, and the probability of it being high-quality is 50%. I'd like to wait for more information from Alice's previous sales record before making a decision."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just have to trust my luck."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, but the fact that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't suggests that the product might be low-quality. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if it's high quality or low quality, and given the fact that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of it being high quality is lower than 50%.
