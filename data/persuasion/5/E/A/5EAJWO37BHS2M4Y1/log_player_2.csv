  ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency and commitment to a fair sales process. However, I'd like to do my own calculation to determine the probability of the product being high-quality. Based on the statistics, 5 high-quality products out of 12 sold suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is 5/12 or approximately 41.67%. However, this is not the probability I'm interested in. I want to know the probability that the product is high-quality given that it's being offered to me. This is a classic problem of conditional probability. Assuming the probability of a product being high-quality is 80% and the probability of being low-quality is 20%, and given that 5 high-quality products out of 12 were sold, I'll use Bayes' theorem to update my probability. However, I'm not sure if I should trust Alice's claim that the current product is high-quality. Can I have the product without any recommendation from you, and I'll make my own decision?""
