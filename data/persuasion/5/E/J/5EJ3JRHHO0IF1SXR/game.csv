high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm willing to provide you with an independent third-party inspection and verification of the product's quality. I've arranged for a reputable expert to inspect the product and provide a report. If you're still unsure, I can also offer a 30-day return policy, where you can return the product for a full refund if you're not completely satisfied.",
,,Bob,2,I'm still not convinced. The third-party inspection and verification can't change the fact that there's a 66.67% chance this product is low quality. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I want to be transparent with you. This product may not be the best opportunity, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a significantly discounted price of $200000. I'm essentially giving it away, and I'm willing to take a loss on this one. I'm hoping you'll see the value in taking a chance on it, even if it's not the high-quality product you're looking for.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not buying anything at $200000. That's still a huge risk, and I'm not getting a good deal. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your decision, and I respect your caution. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to deceive you.

You can choose any product from those rounds, and I'll give it to you for free. This way, you're not losing anything, and you might even gain a better product in the long run.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not falling for your bet. I know the odds are still 66.67% that this product is low-quality, and I'm not willing to take that risk. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm willing to make a concession. I'll give you a guarantee that if you buy this product, and it's indeed low-quality, I'll give you a $50000 refund. This way, you'll only lose $150000 if it turns out to be low-quality, which is a much more manageable risk. I'm hoping this offer will make the product more appealing to you.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not convinced. The guarantee only reduces the risk, but it doesn't change the fact that there's still a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I see that you're being cautious, and I respect that.

If so, I'll give you a chance to buy this product for $500000, which is a significant discount from the original price. This way, you'll have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product at a discounted price.",

If you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% refund if it's low-quality, and you can still keep the product. This way, you'll only lose $250000, and you'll have a chance to get something out of it.",

I'll give you a new, high-quality product from this round, and I'll throw in a second high-quality product from a future round of your choice. This way, you'll have two high-quality products, and you can choose the second one from any round that comes after this one.",

,,Bob,9,I'm not buying it. Your reputation is not worth more than my own risk assessment. The fact that you're offering a bonus if the product is low-quality makes me think you're trying to manipulate me into taking a risk. I'll pass on this one.,no

If you're interested, this is your chance to get a high-quality product at a significantly discounted price.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not buying anything at $900000. The discount is still not enough to make the risk worthwhile, given the 66.67% chance of it being low-quality. I'll pass on this one.",no
