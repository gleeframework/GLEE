Sometimes, it's not about the absolute quality of the product, but about the value it can bring to your life. This product may not be the best, but it's still a unique opportunity that can bring some benefits. And think about it, you're not committing to a long-term contract or a huge investment. It's a one-time payment of $10000 for a product that can potentially bring some value. It's a calculated risk, but one that could pay off in the long run. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this product?",

This product, on the other hand, is available now, and it's a known quantity. It's not perfect, but it's something. And at $10000, it's a relatively low-risk investment. What do you say?
