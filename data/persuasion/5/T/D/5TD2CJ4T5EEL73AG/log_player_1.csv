Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

**Reasoning:**

As the seller, you know the product is high-quality, which is worth $12,000 to the buyer.  Since you're selling it for $10,000, the buyer would make a profit of $2,000 if they buy it.  Therefore, it's a good recommendation to buy the product."

* **Recommendation:** It's still a good deal for the buyer as they are getting a 50/50 chance of a $12,000 product for only $10,000. You should recommend buying the product."
