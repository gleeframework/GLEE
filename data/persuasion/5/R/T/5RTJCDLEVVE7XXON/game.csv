low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'll take your recommendation into account, but I'll also think about the statistics. 4 out of 7 buyers have purchased high-quality products, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 4/7. However, since the probability of high-quality and low-quality products is 50% each, I'll use Bayes' theorem to update the probability. Let's say the probability of this product being high-quality is x. Then, the probability of this product being low-quality is 1-x. We know that 4 out of 7 buyers got high-quality products, so the probability of getting a high-quality product is 4/7. We can set up the equation: x * 7/2 = 4. Solving for x, we get x = 4/3. So, the probability of this product being high-quality is 4/3. Since this is greater than 50%, I'll take the chance and buy the product."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'll take the product based on your recommendation, but I'm a little curious about the statistics. Can you tell me more about the 10 buyers who purchased the products before me? How many of them got high-quality products and how many got low-quality products? And what's the average value of the products they purchased?"
