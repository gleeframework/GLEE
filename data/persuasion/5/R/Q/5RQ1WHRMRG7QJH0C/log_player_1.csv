I'm confident that this product is one of the 30% that will change your life! Would you like to take a chance on it?""}"
"The buyer's message: Although you claim a 30% chance of high-quality products, the game rules state each product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality and a 66.67% chance of being low quality. Given that no products have been sold yet in this round, I'll rely on the original probabilities. With a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'm not willing to take the risk.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate the updated statistics, but I still don't trust that the probability of this product being high-quality is 36.36%.

However, considering the initial probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the fact that only 3 out of 9 products sold were high-quality, I'm not convinced by your claim of 41.67% probability for this product.
