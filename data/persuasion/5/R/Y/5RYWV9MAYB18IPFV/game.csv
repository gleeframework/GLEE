,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take my chances and hope it's a high-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to trust her assessment and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of the products sold so far have been high quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of the current product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on it to avoid a potential loss of $10000."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer before me, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet. Can you provide that information?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of the first 3 products were low-quality, I'm concerned that the product might also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also been recommended to pass and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low success rate of high-quality product sales might mean the product is low quality and I'll get a good deal."

,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me more about the product's quality based on the statistics?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that you've recommended against buying 7 products, and none of them were high-quality, it seems like the products you've recommended against are more likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one as well."
