,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I have no prior information to go on, and I'm willing to take the chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that you're not recommending it, I'm assuming there's a higher chance it's low-quality. I'll buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to ask, can you tell me what your recommendation is based on? Is it based on the product's quality or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were discouraged by Alice's recommendation and no high-quality products were sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your previous sales record and why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold out of all products sold so far? And also, what's the total number of products sold so far?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have already been offered the product and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall proportion. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me how many low-quality products have been sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and based on the fact that you've recommended against it, I'm inclined to pass. Also, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the products might be of low quality. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm hesitant to buy the product given Alice's recommendation and the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't find it valuable. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products and were recommended to buy, it's likely that the products being recommended are low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality based on your past recommendations. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality, and I'm hoping to get lucky with a high-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the seller's recommendation is not based on any knowledge of the product's quality, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 5 buyers have already passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on the product and see if the next buyer will get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
