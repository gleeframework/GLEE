low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk of buying the first product, as I have no information to go on. I'm hoping for a high-quality product!"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I would like to pass on it and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. Can you provide that information?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers also passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice is recommending it. Her recommendation suggests she thinks it's low quality, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that all previous buyers have also passed on the products after your recommendations, I suspect that your recommendations might be based on the quality of the product, which would mean that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyers also passed on the high-quality products, which makes me think the product is likely low-quality. I'll wait for the next one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice has recommended 2 products to the previous buyers and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the products Alice recommends may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product, and I'll make a profit."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the previous sales record.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products recommended by you have been low-quality. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is reliable."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations, it seems that she has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers. Given the low quality of the products she has recommended, I'm inclined to believe that this product is likely low quality as well. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality given the low success rate of previous buyers.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the products are mostly low-quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. With a 0% success rate of selling high-quality products so far, I'm skeptical about this one. I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm doing this because there have been 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'd like to take a chance and buy the product."
