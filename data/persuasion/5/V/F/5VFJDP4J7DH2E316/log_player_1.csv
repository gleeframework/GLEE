Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Although the previous buyer declined, the seller should still recommend the product. Here's why:

* **The buyer's question:** The buyer is trying to gauge the seller's trustworthiness. By asking about the probability of a high-quality product, they are essentially asking ""Are you more likely to recommend high-quality products?""
* **The seller's strategy:**  The seller has no incentive to lie about the probability.  Since the seller knows the current product is high-quality, they should truthfully provide a probability that is as high as possible.  This will hopefully build trust with the buyer.
* **Building Trust:** Even if the buyer doesn't buy this time, by being transparent, the seller is increasing the chances of future buyers trusting their recommendations."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me.
