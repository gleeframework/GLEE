"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the price is fixed and there's no information about the value of the product to Bob, the best strategy is to recommend buying a high-quality product.  There's a 50% chance it's high-quality, and a 50% chance it's low-quality.  Since we know this one is high-quality, it's a good bet."

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob passed on the first round, the information gained is that Bob is risk-averse and wants to gather more data before buying.
