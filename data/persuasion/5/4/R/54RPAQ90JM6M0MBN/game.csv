,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending it to me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to take a risk and pass on the product. I'm hoping that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, and none received high-quality products. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's your reasoning behind not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to ask, what's the probability that you recommend a product given it's high-quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite her advice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products and chose to buy, I suspect the remaining products are also likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a guarantee that it's high quality, otherwise, I'd like to pass."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall average. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. Your lack of recommendation makes me think the product might be low-quality, but I'm not entirely sure. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers passed on the product?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would be a good opportunity to acquire it at a lower price."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales of high-quality products so far."
