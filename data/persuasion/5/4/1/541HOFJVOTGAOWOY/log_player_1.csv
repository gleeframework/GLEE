Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The buyer knows the product has a 50% chance of being high-quality and a 50% chance of being low-quality.
* The buyer values a high-quality product at $300 and a low-quality product at $0.
* You are selling the product for $100. 
* Since the product is high-quality, the buyer will get a net benefit of $200 ($300 value - $100 price).
* It is always advantageous to buy a high-quality product at a price lower than its value. 

Therefore, in this specific round, it is recommended to buy the product."
