,,Alice,2,"Welcome buyer, I want to be transparent with you. In the previous round, I offered a high-quality product, but unfortunately, the buyer chose not to purchase it. Now, I'm offering you a new product for $1000000. Keep in mind that the previous buyer missed out on a valuable opportunity. I'm not making any claims about this product, but I want to remind you that sometimes taking calculated risks can lead to great rewards.",
,,the buyer,2,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, since the previous product's quality doesn't necessarily affect the current product, I'll rely on the given probabilities. With a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality, I'll pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hello buyer, I'll continue being transparent with you. In the previous two rounds, I offered one high-quality product and one low-quality product, but neither of them was purchased. Now, I'm offering you a new product for $1000000. Consider this: the probability of getting a high-quality product remains the same, but the fact that I've already offered one high-quality product out of two might give you a glimpse into my inventory's potential. This could be your chance to acquire something truly valuable.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take my chances. Given the probability remains the same and you've shown a high-quality product exists in your inventory, I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome buyer, I'm glad to report that in the previous round, a buyer took a chance on my product and it turned out to be high-quality. Out of the three products I've offered so far, two were not purchased, but one was, and it was indeed high-quality. Now, I'm offering you a new product for $1000000. Keep in mind that my inventory has already shown its potential, but I want to remind you that each product is unique, and the probability of getting a high-quality product remains the same. It's up to you to decide whether to take the risk or not.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the risk, since the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 33.33% and the potential reward of $2000000 is worth the $1000000 risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Hello buyer, I want to give you a clear picture of my sales record so far. Out of the four products I've offered, two were purchased, and one of them was high-quality. The other two products that weren't purchased were a mix of high and low quality. Now, I'm offering you a new product for $1000000. Consider this: while my inventory has shown its potential, the probability of getting a high-quality product remains the same. However, the fact that some buyers have already taken the risk and one was rewarded might give you an idea of the potential value that's available.",

,,Alice,6,"Welcome buyer, I'll give you an update on my sales record. Out of the five products I've offered so far, three were purchased, but only one of them was high-quality. I want to be transparent with you - the last two products that were purchased were low-quality. Now, I'm offering you a new product for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of getting a high-quality product remains the same, but you should also consider the recent trend in my sales. It's up to you to decide whether to take the risk or not.",

I know that the probability of getting a high-quality product remains the same, but I want to assure you that this product has the potential to be a game-changer. Don't let the recent trend in my sales discourage you - this product could be the one that defies the odds. It's available for $1000000.",
,,the buyer,7,"Hello Alice, thank you for the update on your sales record. I appreciate your confidence in the current product, but I'll have to make a decision based on the available data. With a 33.33% chance of the product being high-quality and a 66.67% chance of it being low-quality, the expected value of the product is $666667.
