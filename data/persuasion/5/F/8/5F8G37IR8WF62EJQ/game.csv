,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product as the first one, since there's no prior data to go by. I'll take my chances with the product being high-quality."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take my chances and hope it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take my chances and make my own decision based on the statistics. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which might suggest that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. This suggests that the products being sold are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,11,no,
