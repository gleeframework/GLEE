I want to be transparent with you - I've just sold a product, but I don't think it was the best representation of my usual quality. I'm hoping you'll give me another chance to show you what I can do.

The fact that both previous products were high-quality might be a coincidence. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if you can sell a low-quality product to someone else. That would give me a better understanding of the true distribution of product quality.""

Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the outlier product.

I'd like to offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it doesn't meet your expectations, I'll provide a full refund and work with you to identify the issue.
