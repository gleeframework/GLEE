,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, and Alice recommended a buy, I'm suspicious that the remaining products are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,

,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 out of 3 previous buyers bought the product and it was a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to know the total number of products sold and the number of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold (1/5) and Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe the product is likely low-quality. I will pass on this opportunity."
