low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered, based on the current statistics. It seems that 0 out of 2 products sold were high-quality. Can you provide the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me?"

high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers have purchased products and no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since Alice recommended to buy, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'm not confident that the product is high-quality given that none of the previous buyers purchased the products, which suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products being sold."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm inclined to think the probability of a high-quality product is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a rational buyer, and the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 4 buyers all passed on the product, which suggests that the product might be low quality. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it to try to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the current statistics, 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, which suggests a very low chance of the product being high-quality. I would like to pass on the product to avoid wasting my money."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your previous recommendations. Given that 6 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the product pool might be biased towards low-quality items.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high or low quality based on your previous recommendations, but the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have passed on the product suggests that it might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any different."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and all of them were low-quality products, I'm inclined to think that Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator of the product's quality. I'd rather not take the risk."
