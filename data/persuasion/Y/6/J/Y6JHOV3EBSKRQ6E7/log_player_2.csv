Round 3
Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested! However, I want to let you know that I've noticed you've bought two high-quality products in a row. I'm starting to think that the $100 price tag might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to give you a 5% discount on this one, but only if you buy it now. If you don't, I'll go back to the full price of $100. What do you say?

The price is $100, and that's it. But I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not what you're looking for, I'll give you a chance to exchange it for a different product in a future round. What do you say?

Round 6
Alice's message: I'm glad you trust me! However, I want to let you know that I've noticed you've bought six high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that $100 might be a bit too low a price for you. I'm willing to give you a 2% premium on this one, taking the price up to $102. But I'll still honor the exchange guarantee if you're not satisfied. What do you say?

I've had some mixed feedback on this one, and I'm not sure if it's worth the standard $100 price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90, but I want to make it clear that this is a one-time offer. If you don't like it, I won't be offering any discounts or exchanges. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I prefer to stick with the higher-quality products for now.""}"

Round 8
Alice's message: No problem, I understand. I've got another high-quality product for you, and I'm going to go back to the standard price of $100. However, I want to remind you that you did miss out on a great deal last round, and I'm not sure if this one will be as good. But I'm willing to give you a chance to make up for it.

But I'm willing to let you have it for $90, and I'll throw in a 10% refund if you're not satisfied. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it, but I understand if you'd rather wait for a better option.

Round 10
Alice's message: No problem, I understand. I've got another product that's not quite up to my usual standards. I'm going to be honest with you, this one is probably not worth the $100 price tag.
