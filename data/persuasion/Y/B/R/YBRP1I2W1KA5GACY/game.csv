,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 out of 2 buyers purchasing a product, and no high-quality products sold, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by the lack of sales of high-quality products so far. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better.

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. Given the 2/3 chance of a low-quality product, I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you tell me more about the products that were sold to the previous two buyers?

,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be high-quality, given the lack of sales so far."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers received low-quality products, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is low and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. How many products have been offered in total so far, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total products offered?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even with your recommendation against it. I'm willing to take a chance on the product, as the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33% and I could potentially get a $20000 product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product, Alice. Is it because of the low sales record of high-quality products so far?"

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, considering the 4 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this one."
