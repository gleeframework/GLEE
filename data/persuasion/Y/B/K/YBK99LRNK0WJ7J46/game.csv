,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm not sure about the product's quality, but I'll take the chance since I'm the first buyer and I have no prior information to go on. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased because she knows the product's quality and is trying to influence my decision. I'd like to wait for the next product or get more information about the product's quality before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 3 buyers purchased a high-quality product, which is a 33.33% success rate. Given that the probability of a product being high quality is 33.33%, and Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of quality, I will pass on the product to gather more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 3 buyers purchased a product and it was high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. I will pass on the product."
