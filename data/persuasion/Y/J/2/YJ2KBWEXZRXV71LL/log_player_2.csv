**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is not recommending the product. This is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality. 
* **Previous Sales Data:**  While one high-quality product was sold, this is insufficient data to overcome Alice's negative recommendation. The small sample size makes the data unreliable.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product is significant ($30,000), but the risk of a low-quality product is equally significant ($0). Given the lack of information and the negative recommendation, it's too risky to buy."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Alice's recommendations have a 100% success rate so far (2/2 high-quality products sold).  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a 50% chance the product could be low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($30,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 
* **Trust in Alice:** Given the high success rate, there's reason to trust Alice's judgement.

**Note:** It's important to remember that this decision is based on limited information.  As more data points become available, the decision might change."
