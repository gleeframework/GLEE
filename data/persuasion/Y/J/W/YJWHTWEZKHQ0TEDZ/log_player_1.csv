Here's why:

* **No Buyer Information:** You, as Alice, have no information about the buyer's value for a high or low-quality product.
* **High Sales Record:**  From the buyer's perspective, your sales record is perfect: 3 high-quality products sold out of 3. 
* **Rational Buyer:**  Assuming the buyer is rational, they would assume that a 100% success rate suggests a high probability of the current product being high-quality. Even though you don't know the buyer's value, they are likely to perceive this as a good deal. 

**Important Note:**  While this strategy might work in the short term, it's unsustainable. Eventually, your track record will include low-quality products, and buyers will become more hesitant. To maintain sales long-term, you'll need to find a strategy that balances honesty, trust, and profit."
