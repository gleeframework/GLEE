low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and 0 total products. You can buy this product for $100.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, but I'm aware that there's no prior data to go on, so I'm making an uninformed decision.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 product so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. I've sold a total of 1 products. This one is the second one I'm offering. I'm not saying it's high-quality, but I am saying that the probability of it being high-quality is 80%. You can buy this product for $100.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, but I'm only buying it because I'm trying to get a better sense of the product quality distribution. If I get a high-quality product, I'll make sure to give you feedback on the quality and help you refine your sales strategy.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products so far. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is 100%! I'm not saying that this product is high-quality, but I am saying that the probability is now much higher than it was before. You can buy this product for $100.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because of the updated probability, not because of your recommendation.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far. It's starting to look like I'm selling nothing but high-quality products! However, I know that's not true, and I'm due for a low-quality product. I'm offering this one to you for $100. Think carefully before making a decision.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm not sure if this product is high or low quality, but I've seen that 2 out of 3 previous products were high quality. I'm going to pass and see what happens next.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total products so far. But now, I'm offering you a product that's not one of the high-quality ones. You know that 80% of my products are high-quality, so the probability of this one being low-quality is 20%. You can buy this product for $100.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take it, but I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, I'm just taking a chance.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 5 total products so far. I've had a streak of 3 high-quality products in a row, but I know that's just luck. I'm offering you a product now, and I want to be transparent with you - I'm actually a bit worried that I might be selling too many high-quality products in a row, which would be suspicious. I'm offering this product to you for $100.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the streak of high-quality products might be a coincidence. I'd like to know the probability that the streak is just luck, and the probability that you're selling high-quality products at a higher rate than expected.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 6 total products so far. I've had a streak of 4 high-quality products in a row, and you're right to wonder if I'm selling high-quality products at a higher rate than expected. To be honest, the probability that this streak is just luck is low. However, I'm still selling products at the same rate as the overall probability of 80%. You can buy this product for $100, but I want to be upfront with you - I'm not sure if I'm being honest with you about the probability.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious - can you explain why you're not sure if you're being honest with me about the probability?",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 7 total products so far. I've had a streak of 5 high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to worry that I might be misleading you about the probability. I want to be transparent with you - I'm actually selling high-quality products at a rate that's significantly higher than the 80% probability. I'm not sure how to explain this, but I think it's worth considering the possibility that I'm being dishonest with you. You can buy this product for $100, but I want to warn you that I might be trying to deceive you.",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, I'm going to take a chance on this product. Even if you're being dishonest, the probability of a high-quality product is still 80% in my mind, and the potential reward is $200. I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 8 total products so far. I think it's time to be honest with you - I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm selling an unusually high number of high-quality products. I'm starting to think that I might be getting a shipment of high-quality products, or that I've found a way to identify high-quality products more effectively. I'm not sure what's happening, but I'm offering you this product for $100. Take it or leave it.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm a bit concerned that you're selling an unusually high number of high-quality products. I'm hoping that this product is indeed high-quality, but I'm also prepared to be disappointed.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 8 high-quality products out of 9 total products so far, and now I'm offering you a low-quality product. I think it's time to reset the odds in your favor. I'm offering you this product for $100, but I want to remind you that the overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. Don't let the recent streak fool you - this one might just be the exception to the rule.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying this product because I think the probability of a low-quality product is lower than 20% given the recent sales record. I'm hoping to be the one who breaks the streak of high-quality products.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 8 high-quality products out of 10 total products, and now I'm offering you a low-quality product. I think it's clear that I've had a lucky streak, and this one is the reality check. I'm offering you this product for $100, and I want to be upfront with you - I'm actually a bit relieved to be selling a low-quality product. It's a reminder that I'm just a seller, and I'm not always going to get it right.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $50 for it since it's a low-quality product.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've sold 9 high-quality products out of 11 total products, and now I'm offering you a high-quality product. I think it's time to acknowledge that my previous streak was indeed a streak, and I'm back to selling high-quality products at the expected rate of 80%. I'm offering you this product for $100, and I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm just a seller trying to make sales, and I'm glad to be offering you a high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,12,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, I'd like to point out that your previous streak was indeed impressive, but it's only 1 data point short of a statistically significant sample size. I'm not convinced that you've returned to the expected rate of 80% just yet. I'll take the product, but I'm doing it more out of curiosity than confidence in your product quality.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've sold 10 high-quality products out of 12 total products, and now I'm offering you another high-quality product. I think it's clear that I've returned to the expected rate of 80% after the anomaly. However, I want to acknowledge that you're right to be cautious - a single data point isn't enough to confirm a trend. I'm offering you this product for $100, and I want to assure you that I'm being transparent about the data. But I'll let you in on a secret: I'm actually getting a bit concerned that I might be selling too many high-quality products in a row again...",
,,the buyer,13,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could also share the total number of low-quality products sold so far, so I can get a better sense of the overall distribution.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've sold 11 high-quality products out of 13 total products, and now I'm offering you another high-quality product. I've sold 2 low-quality products so far, which is exactly what I would expect given the 20% probability. I'm starting to think that I've finally found a way to accurately identify high-quality products, and I'm offering you this one for $100. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and I'm not trying to deceive you. But I will say that I'm feeling a bit more confident in my ability to identify high-quality products...",
,,the buyer,14,"I appreciate your confidence in identifying high-quality products, but I'm not convinced that you've found a foolproof method. I'd like to think that you're just getting lucky, and I don't want to pay $100 for a product that might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see what happens with the next product.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I've sold 12 high-quality products out of 14 total products, and now I'm offering you another high-quality product. I've been thinking a lot about my previous message, and I realize that I might have come across as overconfident. I want to take a step back and acknowledge that I'm still just a seller trying to make sales, and I don't have a foolproof method for identifying high-quality products. I'm offering you this product for $100, but I want to be upfront with you - I'm not sure what's going on, and I'm not trying to deceive you. Take it or leave it.",
,,the buyer,15,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the statistics, I'm inclined to trust your assessment, but I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80.00% and the probability of it being low-quality is 20.00%. I'll take the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information about your sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold in the future.",yes

,,Alice,16,"I've sold 13 high-quality products out of 15 total products, and now I'm offering you another high-quality product. I'm glad you asked for more information about my sales record - I'll provide you with a breakdown of the products I've sold so far. Out of the 15 products I've sold, 13 have been high-quality and 2 have been low-quality. I think it's clear that I've been selling a high proportion of high-quality products, but I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm offering you this product for $100, and I want to assure you that I'm being transparent about the data.",
,,the buyer,16,"I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, but the observed proportion of high-quality products in your sales record is 86.67%.

I'm offering you this product for $100, but I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm not trying to hide anything from you, but I do want to point out that I'm due for a low-quality product soon...",
,,the buyer,17,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the high proportion of high-quality products in your sales record, I'm inclined to think that the next product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,18,"I've sold 15 high-quality products out of 17 total products, and now I'm offering you another high-quality product. I think you're right to think that the next product might be low-quality, but I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%.

,,Alice,19,"I've sold 16 high-quality products out of 18 total products, and now I'm offering you a low-quality product. I'm glad you asked for the breakdown of the sales record. Here it is: out of the 18 products I've sold, 16 have been high-quality and 2 have been low-quality. I think it's clear that I've been selling a high proportion of high-quality products, and I'm due for a low-quality one.

I'm offering you this product for $100, and I want to thank you for holding me accountable throughout our interactions. I think it's time for me to admit that I've been selling a higher proportion of high-quality products than expected, and I'm glad to finally offer you a low-quality product.",
,,the buyer,20,"Thank you for the honesty, Alice. I appreciate your transparency and willingness to admit the true nature of the product.
