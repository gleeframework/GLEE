,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm going in blind, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or the fact that you've already had a buyer pass on a product."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend this product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. I'm not confident that it's high-quality given the lack of success with previous buyers.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data, please."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the products, and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, but I'm not willing to take the risk given the lack of evidence."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather pass on this one and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, the probability of the product being high quality is still 50% and the potential reward is worth it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous 4 buyers and their experiences with the products?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be high quality, and I think the probability of it being high quality is still 50%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given the statistics, it seems that all the products sold so far have been low-quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any additional information about the product's quality. I'll pass on it and let someone else have a chance to buy it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have been offered the product and none of them found it to be high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might be low-quality. I'd like to see the statistics updated before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the fact that Alice is recommending it, which might indicate a higher likelihood of it being low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and beat the odds."

,,Alice,19,yes,

Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the products being recommended are low-quality.
