~
Alice's message: I apologize for any confusion. The actual probability calculation is based on Bayes' theorem. Given the prior probability of a product being high-quality (80%), and the likelihood ratio of a high-quality product being sold (8/10), the posterior probability of this specific product being high-quality is approximately 92.3%.
