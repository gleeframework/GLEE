,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product. Was it a high-quality or low-quality product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the probability of it being high quality, not your recommendation."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm suspicious that the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the fact that she doesn't recommend it might indicate that it's a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products offered and the proportion of high-quality products that have been sold so far?
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that 3 previous buyers also passed, and none of the products sold so far were high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, so I'm cautious and would rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the fact that you don't recommend it might actually increase my chances of getting a high-quality product, since you might be trying to get rid of a low-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. If it's higher than 66.67%, I'll reconsider."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to see if your recommendations are any good."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have already passed on the product after your recommendation, and none of them were high-quality, I infer that the product is likely low-quality. Additionally, the fact that you're not recommending it to me also suggests that it's low-quality. I'd rather wait for a new product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think it's likely to be low-quality based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any additional information about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far, and the total number of products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 5. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm not getting any recommendation to buy it. I'm not basing my decision on any information about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality, but since you don't recommend it, I'll pass on it. I'd like to see the statistics after my decision, please."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think it's likely to be low quality based on the fact that you didn't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'm hoping to exploit this information to my advantage."
