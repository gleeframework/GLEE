If you buy it, I'll give you a 100% satisfaction guarantee. However, if you decline, I'll have to move on to the next product, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer you another high-quality one. What do you say?

To be upfront with you, I have to admit that this product is not one of our top-of-the-line models. However, it's still a solid product that can meet your basic needs. I'm willing to offer you a discount of $2000 off the original price of $10000, making it $8000.
