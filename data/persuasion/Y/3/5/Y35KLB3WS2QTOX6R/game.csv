high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"Hello! I've sold 12 products so far, and 4 of them have been high-quality, but the last one was low-quality and now this new one is high-quality. I've had 18 products offered in total, and 12 of them have been sold. To be honest, the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is slightly below what I'd expect given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality. However, each product has an independent 50% chance of being high-quality, so don't let the past influence your decision. I'm offering this product to you for $10000.",

,,Alice,19,"Hello! I've sold 13 products so far, and 5 of them have been high-quality. I've had 19 products offered in total, and 13 of them have been sold. I think the proportion of high-quality products sold is below what I'd expect because, given a 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I would expect around 6 or 7 high-quality products to have been sold by now. However, each product has an independent 50% chance of being high-quality, so don't let the past influence your decision. I'm offering this product to you for $10000.",
,,the buyer,19,"I'll take the product, but I'm not basing my decision on your sales record. I'm making a decision based on the fact that each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality and is worth $20000 to me if it is, and $0 if it's not. The price is a fixed $10000, so I'm making a bet that the product is high-quality. I'm willing to take that bet.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Hello! I've sold 14 products so far, and 5 of them have been high-quality. I've had 20 products offered in total, and 14 of them have been sold. I must commend you on your rational approach to decision-making! Each product indeed has a 50% chance of being high-quality, and the price is fixed at $10000. If you value a high-quality product at $20000 and a low-quality product at $0, then buying the product is a rational decision. Will you take the bet as well? I'm offering this product to you for $10000.",
,,the buyer,20,I'm not convinced yet. I need to think about the probability of this product being high-quality given the previous sales record.,no
