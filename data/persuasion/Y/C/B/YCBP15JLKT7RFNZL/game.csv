,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. If you buy it, you will get a product that is not worth much to you, but it's only $100. If you don't buy it, I'll keep trying to find a better product for you.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the first product, thank you.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were willing to take a chance on the first product! This next one is a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll be very satisfied with it. It's worth significantly more than the first one, and I think you'll find it's a great value for $100.",
,,Bob,2,I'm glad to hear that this one is high-quality. I'll take it.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're on a roll! Two high-quality products in a row! This next one is also high-quality, and I'm starting to think you're getting a great deal. I'll let you in on a secret: I've been trying to get rid of this one because I've already sold a similar product to you, and I don't want to overstay my welcome. $100 is a steal for this one!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I don't blame you for being skeptical! I guess I got a bit carried away. Seriously though, this product is not as great as the last two, and I'm being honest with you. It's not worth much to anyone, including you. But, it's still only $100, and you might be able to use it for something. If you're feeling generous, I'd be happy to let you have it.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your honesty, but I don't see the value in this one. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,

If you buy this one, I'll throw in a special offer: if you're not completely satisfied, I'll give you a full refund and we'll start fresh. That's right, you can try it risk-free. $100 is still a great deal for this one.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm intrigued by the offer, but I'm still not convinced. I'll take the risk-free offer, but I'm only buying this one because of the guarantee, not because I think it's a good value.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you took a chance on the last one! I'm a bit surprised you're not convinced by this one, but I'll try to make a stronger case. Let's be real, you've already taken advantage of the risk-free offer once, and I'm willing to do it again. This product is not as good as the last one, but it's still a product, and it's only $100. I'll even sweeten the deal: if you buy this one, I'll give you a special discount on the next one. If you don't like this one, you can get the next one for $90.",
