high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality, so the probability of this product being high quality is still 50%, but given the previous results, I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not buying, based on your previous sales record, it's likely that the product is low-quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that Alice is not recommending the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy a high-quality product, I'm skeptical that this product is high-quality.
