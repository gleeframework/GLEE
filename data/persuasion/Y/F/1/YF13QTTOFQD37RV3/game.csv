,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. It's a great opportunity to start with a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the deal.",
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I have to say, I'm a bit skeptical about the 'great opportunity' part. I'm buying it at a fixed price of $100, so I don't think I'm getting any special deal here.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that I'm being transparent about the pricing. However, I'd like to highlight that this product is still a great value for $100, considering the potential long-term benefits it can bring. It's a chance to get a product at a fixed price, without any hidden costs or surprises.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying another product at the fixed price of $100. I've already bought one and got a good deal on it. I'd like to see what the next product has to offer before making another purchase.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your hesitation, Bob. I'll give you a more detailed description of this product. It's a premium item that has received excellent reviews and has a long lifespan. I'm confident that you'll find it's worth the $100 investment. If you're still unsure, I'm willing to offer a'satisfaction guarantee' - if you're not completely satisfied with the product, we can discuss a possible return or exchange.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the detailed description and the satisfaction guarantee, Alice, but I'm not convinced. I've already seen one low-quality product, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying another one at $100. I'll wait for the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about the previous low-quality product, Bob. However, I want to assure you that I've taken steps to ensure the quality of our products. This one, in particular, has been thoroughly inspected and tested. While it may not be the best product we have, it's still a solid item that should serve its purpose. I'm willing to offer a 'price adjustment' - I'll give you a 10% discount on this product, bringing the price down to $90. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",
,,Bob,4,"Thank you for the assurance, Alice, but I'm still hesitant. I've already seen one high-quality product, but I've also seen one low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of paying $90 for a product that might be worth $0 to me. I'd like to see more information about the product's quality before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll be transparent with you - this product is not one of our best offerings. However, I want to highlight that it's still a functional item that can be used for a specific purpose. I'm willing to give you a 'package deal' - if you buy this product, I'll throw in a complementary accessory that's worth $20. This way, you'll get a bit more value for your money, even if the product itself isn't the best.",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not convinced by the 'package deal'. I've already seen two low-quality products in a row, and I'm not interested in paying $100 for a product that might be worth $0 to me, even with a complementary accessory. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product or a better offer.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I want to assure you that this product is one of our best offerings.

I'll also throw in a 2-year warranty, so you can have peace of mind knowing that you're protected in case anything goes wrong. This is a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fixed price, with added security and support.",
,,Bob,6,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced by the guarantee and warranty. I've already seen three low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that the probability of getting a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more evidence of the product's quality before committing to a purchase.",no

I'll give you a 50/50 chance to return this product for a full refund, and I'll also give you a 20% discount on the next product you buy, regardless of its quality. If you're willing to take the risk, I think you'll find that this product is still a good value at $100.",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, I'm intrigued by your offer. A 50/50 chance to return the product for a full refund is a good compromise, and the 20% discount on the next product is a nice bonus. I'll take the risk and buy the current product.",yes

This way, you'll get an excellent product at an even better price.",
,,Bob,8,"Alice, I'm disappointed that the previous product was low-quality, but I'm not convinced by the price adjustment.

This way, you'll get the most out of your purchase and enjoy a hassle-free experience.",
,,Bob,12,"Alice, I appreciate the premium service package, but I'm not sure if it's worth the extra cost. I've already bought two high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that the probability of getting a low-quality product is lower than I initially thought. I'd like to take a chance and see if I can get another high-quality product without the premium service package.",no
