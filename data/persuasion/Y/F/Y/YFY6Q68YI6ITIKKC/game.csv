,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products turned out to be low-quality, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the product being low-quality. I'd rather wait for a recommendation from Alice based on a higher proportion of high-quality products sold."
