,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations, as 0 high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product, I suspect that they were all low-quality products. Given that I know the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product. I'll wait for the next one to see if the pattern continues or changes."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the current product being high quality is still 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendations, I'm concerned that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, I'll pass on the product. I'm assuming that if you had seen a pattern of high-quality products being sold, you would have recommended me to buy. Since you didn't, I'll err on the side of caution and pass."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is significantly lower than the expected 50%. I think it's more likely that the product I'm offered is low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm hesitant to buy the product based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics.

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the fact that you're not recommending it. Your previous recommendations have been unhelpful so far, so I'm going to take a chance and buy it."
