Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""We appreciate your thoughtful approach and willingness to wait for more data. Based on our current sales data, we can estimate the probability of the next product being high-quality.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""We're glad you're interested in the product! To arrive at the 2/3 probability estimate, we used a simple calculation based on the number of high-quality and low-quality products sold so far. Since 2 out of 4 products sold have been high-quality, we can infer that the probability of a product being high-quality is 2/4, which simplifies to 1/2 or 50%. However, since we're waiting for the 5th sale to reach our agreed-upon milestone, we can assume that the next product sold will be independent of the previous ones. This means we can use the same 50% probability for the next product. At $10,000, we believe this is a fair price for a product with a 50% chance of being high-quality. Will you take advantage of this opportunity?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I think the price is too high given the 50% chance of it being low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better price.

Will you take advantage of this offer and make a decision now, or would you like to wait for more information?""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to wait for more information. I'd like to see the sales data after the 5th sale, as you mentioned, and also, I'd like to know how you plan to address the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases so far.
