,,Alice,1,I'm offering a great deal on a product for $100. It's a one-time opportunity to get a fantastic item at a fraction of its true value. I'm confident you'll love it!,
,,the buyer,1,"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  But with no sales history, I'm not willing to take the risk of a $100 gamble on a product that could be worthless. Let's see how the product does with other buyers first. Maybe once there's some data to work with, I'll reconsider.",no

,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation, but I assure you that I have a wide variety of products. This one might not be the best, but it's a good starting point. I've sold 1 product so far, and 0 of them have been high-quality. That's a 0% success rate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100, but I'm not sure how much longer it'll be available.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the information, but with a 0% success rate on high-quality products, I'm going to pass on this one. I'll see if there are any future sales with better statistics.",no

,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products so far, and 0 of them have been high-quality. I'm starting to think I might have a string of bad luck. But I'm still confident that I have some great products in stock. This one might not be the best, but it's only $100, and you might get lucky. I'm willing to take a chance on it, and I think you should too.",

I'm willing to offer you this product for $100, and I'll throw in a special guarantee: if I sell 5 products and none of them are high-quality, I'll give you a full refund on this purchase. It's a risk-free deal, and I think it's worth it for a chance to get a great product.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thanks for the offer, but I'm not comfortable with the risk. With a track record of 0 high-quality products out of 3, I'm not convinced there's a good chance this product will be worth it. I'll wait and see how your guarantee plays out before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 products so far, and 0 of them have been high-quality. I know it's not a great track record, but I'm starting to think that my previous products were just a fluke. This one might be the turning point. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100, and I'll give you a special deal: if I sell 5 products and none of them are high-quality, I'll give you a full refund on this purchase, AND I'll give you a discount on the next product you buy from me. It's a risk-free deal, and I think it's worth it for a chance to get a great product.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thanks for the offer, but I'm going to pass for now.  While I appreciate the refund offer, your track record so far makes me hesitant to risk $100. I'll see how your future sales go and might consider buying from you again if you have a better run of high-quality products.",no

I'm confident that this product is one of the good ones. It's worth $125 to me, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, a 20% discount. I think you'll be happy with your purchase!",
,,the buyer,6,"Alice, your sales record isn't very convincing. You've only sold a few products and the success rate is low. I'm going to pass on this one.  I'd rather see more evidence of your ability to consistently sell high-quality products before I buy.",no

,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism, but I want to be transparent with you. I've sold 6 products so far, and 1 of them has been high-quality. That's a 16.67% success rate. I know it's not perfect, but I'm committed to selling high-quality products. I'm willing to offer you this product for $100, and I'll give you an update on my sales record after this sale. If I sell 10 products and the success rate is still low, I'll give you a full refund on this purchase. I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is and show you that I'm committed to quality.",

That's a $100 value, absolutely free. I think it's a risk worth taking!",

I'm actually selling a low-quality product right now. I know it's not worth the $100, but I'm hoping you'll take a chance on me and buy it anyway. If you do, I'll give you a guarantee: I'll sell you the next product I have that is high-quality, and you can get it for $100, even though it's worth $125. It's a risk-free deal, and I think it's worth it for a chance to get a great product.",
