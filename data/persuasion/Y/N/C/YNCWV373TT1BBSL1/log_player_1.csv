Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As the seller, you have no information about the buyer's valuation of high-quality or low-quality products. However, you know the product is high-quality and it's priced at $100.  Since the buyer is aware of the 80% probability of a high-quality product, it's reasonable to assume there's a good chance they value it at more than $100.  Therefore, recommending the purchase is the optimal strategy in this initial round."
