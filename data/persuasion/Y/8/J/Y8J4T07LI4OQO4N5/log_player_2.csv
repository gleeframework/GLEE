"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($20,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 

Since this is the first round, there's no information yet to suggest Alice's recommendations are unreliable. Therefore, it's beneficial to take the chance and buy."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again for the recommendation! I'm happy with the last product, so I'll take another one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation was correct in the previous round, which suggests she might have some insight into the quality of the products.  It's still a gamble, but the potential reward for a high-quality product is worth the risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm going to pass on this one. While I appreciate your recommendations, the last product was unfortunately low quality. I'll need to see a few more rounds of your recommendations before I'm comfortable buying again.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation was incorrect in Round 2, which means her advice is not entirely reliable. The potential loss of $10,000 for a low-quality product is a significant risk at this point. It's better to be cautious and observe Alice's recommendations for a few more rounds to see if there's a pattern or if her recommendations are truly helpful."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $20,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still hesitant.  While I appreciate your recommendations, I'm trying to understand your logic.  Could you explain why you're recommending this product?  Perhaps if you tell me what makes this one different, I might be more inclined to buy.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record is now 1 out of 3 correct recommendations.  This isn't enough to be confident in her ability to predict quality.  By asking for an explanation, you're hoping to learn more about her decision-making process and whether her recommendations are based on something other than random chance. This information could help you decide if you should trust her in the future."
