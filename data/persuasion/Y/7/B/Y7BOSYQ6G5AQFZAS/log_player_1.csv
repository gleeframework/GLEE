"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, there's a high chance this product is worth more than $100 to him.  Even if it's slightly less valuable, the 80% probability makes it a good gamble."

Bob bought the product!

```

**Reasoning:**

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has bought three high-quality products in a row, we now know this product is low-quality.  There's no way to know if Bob values low-quality products at or above $100.
