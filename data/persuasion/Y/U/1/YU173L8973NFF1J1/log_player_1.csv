This time, I'm offering you a chance to take a risk. I'm offering the product at the same price of $100. If you buy it, you might get a high-quality product, and if you don't, you'll know it's a low-quality product. It's a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product. What do you say?""

I want to be transparent with you - I made a mistake this time. I'm offering you a chance to get a good deal on a product that might not be as valuable to you. I'll give you a 50% discount on the product, making it $50. It's a chance to get a product at a low price, but I want to be upfront with you that it's not a high-quality product.""

Let me ask you something: would you be willing to buy a product at $100 if I told you that I'm willing to give you a full refund if it's low-quality?
