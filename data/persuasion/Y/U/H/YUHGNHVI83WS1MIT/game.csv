low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first round. I'm offering you a product for $1000000. I'm not sure what it's worth to you, but I'll give you a chance to find out. If you buy it, you'll get to know its quality after the purchase. If you don't buy it, I'll offer you another one in the next round.",
,,Bob,1,I'll buy the current product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You bought a low-quality product for $1000000. I'm still offering you a product for the same price. Since you're willing to pay $1000000 for a low-quality product, I'm curious to see if you'll pay the same price for a high-quality one. What do you think this next product is worth to you?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure what the current product is worth to me, but I've already lost $1000000 on the last one. I'll pass for now.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're right, the last product wasn't worth the price. I'm offering you another product for $1000000. Since you've already lost $1000000 on a low-quality product, I'm wondering if you're willing to take a chance on another low-quality product for the same price. I'm trying to understand your risk tolerance.",
,,Bob,3,I'm not willing to take another chance on a low-quality product for the same price. I'll pass for now.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're playing it safe, and I don't blame you. I'll give you a hint: the probability of the next product being high-quality is the same as it was in the first round. If you're still not willing to take a chance, I'll keep offering you the next product for $1000000. But if you do decide to buy, I'll be curious to see if you'll pay the same price for a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the hint, but I'm still not willing to take a chance on another low-quality product for $1000000. I'll wait for a better opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're being cautious, and I respect that. I'll give you another hint: since you've seen two low-quality products in a row, the probability that the next product is high-quality is still 33.33%, but it's now more likely that the next product is high-quality compared to the previous two. If you're still not willing to take a chance, I'll keep offering you the next product for $1000000. But if you do decide to buy, I'll be curious to see if you'll pay the same price for a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the hint, but I'm not convinced that the next product is more likely to be high-quality. I'll keep passing for now.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're not convinced, and I don't blame you. Since you've seen three low-quality products in a row, I'll give you a more direct offer: I'll give you a 50% discount on the next product, making it $500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if you'll get a better deal than this in the future. What do you think about this offer?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not willing to take a chance on a product that could be low-quality. The discount doesn't change the fact that I could end up losing $500000 on a low-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're right, the discount doesn't change the risk. I'll give you another offer: I'll reveal the quality of the next product to you before you buy it. If it's high-quality, you can buy it for $1000000. If it's low-quality, you can walk away with no loss. What do you think about this offer?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm willing to take a chance on this offer. I'd rather know the quality of the product before buying, and if it's low-quality, I can walk away without losing any money.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You've taken a chance and chosen to know the quality before buying. Since the last product was low-quality, I'm curious to see if you'll take a chance on the next one without knowing its quality. I'll remind you that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. You can either take a chance and buy it for $1000000, or wait for the next round where you can choose to know the quality beforehand.",
,,Bob,8,I'm not going to take another chance on a product without knowing its quality. I'll wait for the next round where I can choose to know the quality beforehand.,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're sticking to your strategy, and I respect that. Now that you've seen two low-quality products and one high-quality product, I'll give you a new offer. Since you know the quality of the next product, you can buy it for $800000. If you buy it, you'll get a high-quality product for a discounted price. What do you think about this offer?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in buying a product at a discounted price, regardless of its quality. I'd rather wait for the next round where I can choose to know the quality beforehand and potentially get a high-quality product for the full price of $1000000.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're holding out for the full price, and I don't blame you. Since you've seen three low-quality products in a row after the high-quality one, I'll give you another chance to know the quality beforehand. If you buy the next product, you'll get to know its quality, and if it's high-quality, you can pay the full price of $1000000. What do you think about this offer?",
,,Bob,10,I'll take you up on your offer. I'd rather know the quality of the product beforehand and pay the full price if it's high-quality.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You've taken the chance to know the quality beforehand, and it's low-quality again. I'm curious to see if you'll take a chance on the next product without knowing its quality. However, since you've seen four low-quality products in a row, I'll give you a final offer: if you buy the next product, I'll give you a 20% chance to negotiate the price down to $800000 if it's high-quality. What do you think about this offer?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in taking a chance on a product without knowing its quality, and I'm not tempted by the 20% chance to negotiate the price down. I'll stick to my strategy of waiting for the next round where I can choose to know the quality beforehand.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You're sticking to your strategy, and I respect that. Since you've seen five low-quality products in a row, I'll give you a last-minute offer. If you buy the next product, I'll reveal the quality to you, and if it's high-quality, I'll give you a 25% discount, making it $750000. This is my final offer. What do you think about this chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price?",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a product at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for the next round where I can choose to know the quality beforehand and potentially get a high-quality product at the full price of $1000000.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"You're holding out for the full price, and I don't blame you. Since you've finally seen a high-quality product, I'll give you a final offer. You can buy this high-quality product for $1000000, and I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next product to you, and if it's high-quality, you can buy it for the same price. This is my last offer. What do you think about this deal?",
,,Bob,13,"I'll take you up on your offer. I'm willing to pay the full price for the high-quality product, and I appreciate the guarantee on the next product. I'll buy the current product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"You've made a great decision, and I'm glad you're happy with the high-quality product. Now, as per our deal, I'll reveal the quality of the next product to you. Since it's low-quality, I'm not going to offer you any discounts or special deals. You can either buy it for the full price of $1000000, or you can walk away with no loss. The decision is yours.",

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You're being cautious, and I respect that. Since you've already bought one high-quality product and walked away from the last one, I'll give you a new offer. You can buy this high-quality product for $900000, which is a 10% discount from the original price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if you'll get a better deal than this in the future.
