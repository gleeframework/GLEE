high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that the previous buyers received low-quality products, and Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products to get rid of them. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the products, I suspect that all of them received low-quality products. This makes it likely that the current product is also of low quality. I'd like to pass on the product."
