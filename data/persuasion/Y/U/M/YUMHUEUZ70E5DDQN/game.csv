However, I want to make sure you're completely satisfied, so I'll make you an offer that's even more attractive than before. I'll give you a 7-year warranty, which is worth $70000, and I'll also include a premium upgrade package that's worth $30000. But here's the twist: I'll give you the option to buy this product for $950000, and if you're not satisfied, you can return it within 60 days for a full refund. But if you do decide to keep it, I'll give you a special bonus of $50000 on top of the original price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, I appreciate the generous offer, but I'm still hesitant after the previous low-quality product. I'm not willing to take the risk again, especially with the high price tag. I'll have to pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity.",no

With that in mind, I want to offer you a 'lottery ticket' deal. I'll sell you this product for $200000, and if it turns out to be high-quality, you'll get the full $1200000 value. But if it's low-quality, I'll give you a $50000 credit towards your next purchase. It's a 4:1 payout ratio, and I think it's a great opportunity to take a chance on a potentially high-quality product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"Alice, I'm not sure I'm ready to take another risk after the last two low-quality products. The 4:1 payout ratio is tempting, but I'm not willing to bet that much money again. I'll have to pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity.",no
