However, it's also possible that you're just seeing a streak of luck. I'll give you some additional information: the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, you'll get a refund of $10,000. If you buy it and it's high-quality, you'll get a product worth $40,000. What do you think?""}"

I'm offering you a product now. If you buy it and it's high-quality, you'll get a product worth $40,000. If you buy it and it's low-quality, you'll get a refund of $10,000.

Let me give you the actual probability: 22.22%. I'm offering you this product at a price of $10,000. If you buy it and it's high-quality, you'll get a product worth $40,000.

If you buy it, you'll get a product worth $40,000. If you don't buy it, you'll miss out on a potential $40,000 product. Consider the fact that the last two products were low-quality, but the product before that was high-quality. What do you think?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. Given the updated probability of 20%, I think the potential reward is worth it.
