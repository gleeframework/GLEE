high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than 50%, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 0%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I've seen that 2 other buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current sales record and your previous recommendations.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, I believe it's likely that the product I'm being offered is of low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I've seen that 2 previous buyers also bought the product, but none of them got a high-quality product. Given the 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."

,,Alice,11,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend me to buy the product, and the statistics that 3 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that Alice is trying to get rid of a low-quality product.
