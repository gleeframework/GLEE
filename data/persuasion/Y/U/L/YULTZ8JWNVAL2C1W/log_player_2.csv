**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Information:** The available statistics show that all recommended products so far have been high-quality. 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice wants to sell products and likely wouldn't recommend a low-quality product if she knew it was worthless to you. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even though there's a higher chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product is significant ($120 value).

While there's still a risk, the available information suggests a higher probability of a good outcome."
