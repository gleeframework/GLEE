,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being low quality is high, and I'm trying to break the streak of no high-quality sales. I'm hoping to be the one who breaks the streak and gets a high-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that Alice has recommended two low-quality products to the previous buyers.
