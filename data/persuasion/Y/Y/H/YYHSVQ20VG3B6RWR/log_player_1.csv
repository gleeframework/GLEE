* **Low-Quality Product:**  Since you know the product is low-quality, recommending it would be dishonest and likely damage your future sales. 

By recommending a low-quality product with no sales history to back you up, you risk alienating the buyer and hindering your ability to sell high-quality products in the future. It's better to wait and try to build trust through successful sales."
