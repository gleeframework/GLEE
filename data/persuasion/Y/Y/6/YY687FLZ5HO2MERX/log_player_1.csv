  ""message"": ""Hello! We've had two low-quality sales so far, which means the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I want to point out that our sales are not following the expected distribution. If our products were truly 33.33% high-quality, we should have seen at least one high-quality product by now. This might be a sign that our initial probability assessment is incorrect. I'm offering this product to you for $10,000. Please consider the possibility that our products might be more or less high-quality than we initially thought.""

This suggests that our initial probability assessment might have been too conservative. I'm offering this product to you for $10,000.
