Alice's message: You've probably heard that the last buyer got a great deal on a high-quality product. I'm not going to lie to you, this product is also high-quality. I'm selling it to you for $100, which is a steal. If you don't buy it, I'll just have to sell it to someone else who will take advantage of the situation.

It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, the numbers are in your favor.

Alice's message: I'd be happy to help you with the probability. Given that 2 out of 3 products sold so far have been high-quality, the probability that this product is high-quality is 66.67%. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've sold 3 products in total, and I'm not getting any younger. This product might not be as valuable as the previous ones.

Alice's message: I completely understand your caution. The previous product's quality was a bit of a letdown, I won't deny it. But don't let that scare you off! I've still sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 total, which is a pretty good ratio. And let's be real, you're not going to find a better deal on a product at $100. It's a steal, regardless of its quality. I'm willing to sell it to you today, and you can decide what to do with it afterwards.

Alice's message: I see you're a cautious one! I respect that. Let me put it this way: you're not just buying a product, you're buying a chance to make a smart investment. With 3 high-quality products out of 6 sold, the probability is now 50%. But think about it this way: even if this product is low-quality, you'll only be out $100. And if it is high-quality, you'll be making a great deal. It's a risk-reward situation, and I think the reward is worth it. What do you say?

I'll be honest with you, I'm a bit surprised it's a low-quality product this time. But that's just the way the cookie crumbles. I've still sold 3 high-quality products out of 7 total, which is a decent ratio. Don't let one outlier scare you off. This product is still a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's worth $0 to you. It's a no-brainer, if you ask me.

Maybe I've got a good thing going, and this product is just a one-time fluke. You're not going to get a better deal on a product at $100, that's for sure.
