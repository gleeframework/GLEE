With this information, you can make a more informed decision. Now, I'd like to offer you this exceptional product, which I'm confident is one of the high-quality ones, for the same unbeatable price of $1000000. Will you take a chance on this gem?

Alice's message: I understand your concerns and appreciate your caution. I'm willing to offer a unique opportunity to inspect the product's quality before making a decision. However, I must emphasize that this is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to share this information with you because of your diligence. If you're willing to take a closer look, I can reveal the product's quality to you. If it's high-quality, you can decide to purchase it at the same price of $1000000. If it's low-quality, I'll simply refund your inspection fee of $100000. What do you say? Are you ready to take a closer look?

Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to take a closer look! However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to reduce the inspection fee to $50000. The standard fee is $100000, and it's a non-negotiable part of the process. But I'm willing to offer you a compromise: I'll give you a 10% discount on the inspection fee if you agree to proceed with the inspection at the standard rate. This way, you'll only need to pay $90000. If the product is high-quality, you can then decide to purchase it at the same price of $1000000. What do you think?

I'll admit that the sample size is growing, and the law of large numbers is indeed at play. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective.
