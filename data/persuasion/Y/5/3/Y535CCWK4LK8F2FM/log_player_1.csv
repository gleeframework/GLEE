}"
"Bob's message: I'm happy to hear that the product is high-quality and that you're willing to provide additional documentation. However, I'm not sure I see any reason to pay $1000000 for it when I just bought a similar product for the same price in the previous round. I'll pass on this one.

It's a one-time opportunity to acquire a product that's 90% off its original value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100000, which is significantly below its market value. I'm not making a profit on this sale, and I'm willing to take a loss just to clear out inventory. I think it's a rare chance for you to get a great deal, and I'd like to know if you're interested.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm intrigued by the discounted price, but I'm still wary of buying a product from you without knowing its quality. I'll take a chance and buy it, but I'd like to make it clear that I'm doing so at a significant risk, and I expect it to be high-quality.

  ""message"": ""I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I want to assure you that this product is a game-changer.
