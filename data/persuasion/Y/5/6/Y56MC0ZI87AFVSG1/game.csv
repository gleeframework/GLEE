,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'm not going to buy the product. I'd like to see the outcome of the product quality first to update the statistics.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, since it's the first one and I have no prior information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending the product?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows that none of the previous buyers bought a high-quality product. This suggests that the products sold so far may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm taking a chance because I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high, and I don't want to let the opportunity pass."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that you have a vested interest in selling the product, and I'm not sure if your recommendation is influenced by the fact that you're trying to get rid of it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have not purchased the product, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better opportunity."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to all buyers. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to trust her assessment. Since 4 out of 4 previous buyers have been discouraged by her, and none of the products sold were high-quality, it's likely that the products she's recommending are indeed low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold, before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality, considering the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products that have been sold so far. Is there any information about that?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality and I don't want to waste my money."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 6 buyers have already purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information or a better understanding of the product's quality before making a purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'll buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm going to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 7 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I'd rather wait for the next product or try to negotiate a lower price."
