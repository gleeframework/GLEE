high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your cautious approach! As of now, I've sold a total of 2 high-quality products out of 3 products sold, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 2/3. I'm offering this new product to you for $100, which is a great value considering its true value is $200. I'm confident that this product is high-quality, and I'm willing to share that information with you. Would you like to take a chance on this high-quality product and get a great deal?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to take the chance on the high-quality product, but I'd like to clarify that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/3, which is not necessarily a reliable indicator of the quality of the next product. I'm making this decision based on the information you provided, but I'm also aware that the true quality of the product is unknown to me. If it's low-quality, I'll be disappointed, but I'm willing to take the risk.",yes

,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on taking the chance on the high-quality product! I'm glad you're aware of the uncertainty and willing to take the risk.

But if you're not comfortable with the uncertainty, I completely understand. Would you like to take a chance on this product?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take a chance, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. I've seen that you've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4, which is a 50% success rate, but I'm hoping to get a better deal on a high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I appreciate your negotiation skills! However, I'm afraid I can't accept an offer of $80 for a product that's worth $100. I've been transparent about the uncertainty of the product's quality, and I'm willing to offer a discount to those who are willing to take the risk. But I need to make a profit to keep my business running. Would you like to reconsider the original price of $100, or would you like to walk away?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm aware of the uncertainty of its quality and the risk involved. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, I'm not confident that this product is worth the $100 price tag. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.",no
