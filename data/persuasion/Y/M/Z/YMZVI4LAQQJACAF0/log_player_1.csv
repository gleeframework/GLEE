If you buy it, I'll throw in an exclusive deal: if you're not satisfied with the product's value, I'll give you a chance to sell it back to me at the same price I sold it to you. This way, you can try it out and see if it's worth the investment to you.""
}"

Considering you're already willing to pay a premium, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $17500. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.""
}"

}"
