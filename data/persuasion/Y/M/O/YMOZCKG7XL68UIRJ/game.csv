,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on your previous sales record. Can you provide that information?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one high-quality product sold out of one sold, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous buyer got a high-quality product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your recommendation and the fact that the first buyer purchased a high-quality product. I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low success rate of previous buyers. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price of $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is there a pattern or information that led you to advise against buying this product?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, based on your previous sales record and recommendation, I think there's a 50% chance it's high quality, but your recommendation makes me skeptical."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is 1/2, and the probability of a low-quality product is also 1/2. Since Alice recommends the product, it is likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather not risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth only $0 to me."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation against it. I'm taking a chance based on the statistics. Since 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 1/3. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm hesitant to take the risk."
