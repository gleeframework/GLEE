,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know that I'm the first buyer. If it's low quality, I'd like to know the probability of the next buyer getting a high-quality product based on the current data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 1 buyer has already purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous products were high-quality, and the recommendation from Alice might be biased towards selling low-quality products to increase the chances of selling more products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer based on the current statistics."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendation to the first buyer. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
