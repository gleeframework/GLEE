I'm willing to share that we've now sold a total of 4 products, and 3 of them have been high-quality. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 75%. Would you like to take the chance and make an offer?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to pass on this opportunity for now. I'm still concerned about the small sample size and the fact that the probability of the product being high-quality is only 75%, which is lower than the initial 80% chance.
