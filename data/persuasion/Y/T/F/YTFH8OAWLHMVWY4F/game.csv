high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 buyers purchased the product, which suggests a higher than expected proportion of high-quality products.

high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,

high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/4 or 50%, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
