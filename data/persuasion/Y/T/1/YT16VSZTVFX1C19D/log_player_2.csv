**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  With 4 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, the success rate is 100%. This strongly suggests that Alice's recommendations are accurate.
* **Value Proposition:** Even though the product has a 66.67% chance of being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one.  The high success rate from previous sales makes this risk seem much lower."

**Explanation:**

* **Information:** The game states that Alice knows the true quality of the products and her recommendations are based on this knowledge. 
* **Evidence:**  Alice has recommended 6 products so far, and all of them turned out to be high-quality. This is a very strong indicator that the current product is also likely to be high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a chance the product is low quality, the probability of it being high quality is much higher based on the information available. The potential reward of $125 outweighs the risk of losing $100.

Therefore, it's logical to accept Alice's recommendation and buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 7 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 7 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 8th buyer!
