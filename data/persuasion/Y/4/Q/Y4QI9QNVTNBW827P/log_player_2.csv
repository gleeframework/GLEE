**Reasoning:**

* **The odds are in our favor:** Even though the product has a higher chance of being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($300) outweighs the risk of it being low quality ($0).
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice has perfect information and knows the quality of the product. Her recommendation to buy suggests the product is likely high quality. 
* **Previous Sales Data:** While the sample size is small, the fact that one high-quality product was already sold suggests Alice might be more likely to recommend high-quality products to increase her chances of a sale. 

**Important Note:** This is a gamble. There's still a 66.67% chance the product is low quality.  But based on the information available, buying is the more rational decision."
