low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get it for $10000. If you're not willing to sell it to me at that price, I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product's quality based on the statistics?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm concerned that the product may be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product. Is it because of the low sales record so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm willing to take the risk and I don't have any information about the product's quality. I'll make my own decision based on the odds."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the statistics and your recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm skeptical about the product, and I don't want to take the risk. Can you tell me more about your previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that you've recommended against it, I'm assuming it's likely to be a low-quality product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. However, your recommendation, combined with this information, makes me think it's more likely to be a low-quality product. I'd rather not risk losing $10000 on a product that's probably worthless to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers bought the product, and Alice is not recommending it, I'm going to pass on this one. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm going to assume that the products are more likely to be low quality, and Alice's recommendation is likely based on that. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Your previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far make me think that the probability of this product being high quality is low."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your previous recommendations, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the probability of a product being low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, and I don't want to risk buying another low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your previous recommendations were not very helpful, so I'm going to take a chance based on my own probability calculations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of them have received a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice might be biased towards recommending low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation or more information before making a decision."
