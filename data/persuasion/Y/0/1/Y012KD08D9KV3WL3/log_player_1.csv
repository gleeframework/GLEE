I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll offer you a replacement product in the next round. What do you say?""

"Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty about the product's quality. Given that it's low-quality and not worth anything to me, I'll pass on it.

This is a great opportunity to maximize your returns and use up your credits. What do you say?""
}"
"Bob's message: With the accumulated credits and the special deal, buying this high-quality product for $0 (using my $100 credits) + $0 (waived remaining balance) isn't an option, but for $75 - $100 = $0  (all of my credits) + $0 isn't an option either but for 75 - 100 is -25 so i will use 75 dollars of my credits and pay 0, no thats not it but for 75 dollars i will use all of my credits and pay 25 out of pocket is more like it so with a 25 out of pocket cost to get the product that is worth 300 i would be making 275 dollars so thats a yes.
