I'm taking a risk by offering it to you, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in it despite its imperfections. It's still a unique item, but I acknowledge it may not meet your expectations.

In fact, I've taken extra steps to ensure its quality, and I'm confident it will meet or exceed your expectations. I'm willing to offer a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll include a complimentary inspection and certification from a third-party expert, so you can verify its quality before making a decision. The price remains $10000, but I believe the added value of the inspection and certification makes it an even more attractive offer.

I'm willing to make a concession on the price to $8000, but I want to be clear that it's still not the same level of quality as the previous two.
