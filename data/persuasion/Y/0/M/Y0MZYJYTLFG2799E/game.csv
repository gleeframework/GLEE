,,the buyer,2,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I don't have any information about your sales record or the quality of your products.

What do you think?",
,,the buyer,5,"Although you claim this is a high-quality product, I need to consider the overall probability of it truly being high-quality, given the information. There's a 33.33% natural chance of a product being high-quality, and your previous successful sale doesn't significantly alter the odds for this new, independent product. Without more compelling evidence or a better deal, I'll pass.",no
