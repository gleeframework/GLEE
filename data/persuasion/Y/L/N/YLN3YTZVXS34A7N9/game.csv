high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see what happens next."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%?

,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one buyer purchasing and no high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the previous buyer didn't find it valuable, and I'd like to wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 2 previous buyers were also recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards encouraging sales, and I'd rather wait for a recommendation that might be more neutral."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendation. I'm curious, can you tell me more about the products that were sold to the previous two buyers? Were they high-quality or low-quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to see the product's quality for myself."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which might make her think I'll buy it. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the product is high-quality, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the logic behind your recommendation?"
