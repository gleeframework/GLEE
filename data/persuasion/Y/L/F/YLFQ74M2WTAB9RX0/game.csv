,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. I don't have any information to go on, so I'll have to rely on my initial instinct."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,

,,Alice,4,no,

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has recommended a product to the previous buyer, but it was low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could explain your reasoning for not recommending it to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, as the probability is 50% and the potential reward is high if it's high-quality."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. I'm hoping to catch a high-quality product despite her advice."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%, which makes me skeptical about the value of the product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products, given that none of the previous 5 buyers have received high-quality products."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the proportion of low-quality products sold is 1.00, which is suspiciously high. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me what led you to advise against it?

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I think it's likely that the next product will be high quality, and I don't want to waste my $1000000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that all the previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product at a high price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 5 buyers all passed on the product after your recommendation, which suggests that all 5 products might have been low-quality. If that's the case, I'd be getting a high-quality product at a 50% chance, which would be a great deal for me. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not sure if the previous buyers got high-quality products, but since none were sold, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision."
