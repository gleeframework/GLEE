Alice's message: Welcome! You're the second buyer of a high-quality product today. I'm glad you're interested in this opportunity. As you can see, I've already sold one high-quality product, and there's a 50% chance that the next one will be high-quality as well. I'm willing to offer you a deal that's similar to the previous buyer, but I want to make it clear that this product is just as valuable as the one that was sold earlier.

Alice's message: Welcome! I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait. However, I'd like to point out that you're right to question my previous reasoning. The sequence of products doesn't necessarily imply a higher probability of low-quality products. In fact, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. But I want to offer you a different perspective: I've sold 4 high-quality products in total, and 2 of them have been sold in the last 3 rounds. This suggests that the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually higher than 50%.
