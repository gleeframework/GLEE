,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as I don't have any information to go by. I'm hoping for a high-quality product!"

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. Your lack of recommendation suggests that the product might be low-quality, which is more likely given the current statistics. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, but I'm not expecting it to be worth $40000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts. This suggests that the probability of a product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer has a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 buyers have passed on the products, which suggests that all products sold so far are low quality. Given that the probability of a product being low quality is 66.67%, I'm inclined to believe that this product is also low quality. I'd like to pass on the product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see the results of the previous products before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering Alice's recommendation and the statistics. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your previous sales record and why you're recommending me to pass on this product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, it seems like your recommendations are not reliable indicators of the product's quality. I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high, and I don't want to let it go to waste."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the previous 5 buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. How many potential buyers have there been, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of all products sold?"

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products sold so far were low quality, which is a very high proportion. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, I'm suspicious that Alice's recommendation is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the poor track record of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given the low success rate of previous buyers. The lack of high-quality products sold suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered might be lower than 33.33%. I'm hoping to get a good deal."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
