Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, I suspect that the products they were offered were low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, it's possible that the previous 3 products were all low-quality. If that's the case, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%. However, if I buy the current product and it's low-quality, I'll be left with a product worth $0, and I won't have any information about the next product. On the other hand, if I pass on the current product and it's low-quality, I'll have the same information as before, but if it's high-quality, I'll get to buy it and have a product worth $12,500. Therefore, I'll choose to pass on the current product and hope that the next one is high-quality.""
