,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on Alice's recommendation, it's likely to be a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 sale, which suggests a 0% success rate. However, I know that the true probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 buyers who received Alice's recommendation to buy purchased the product, but none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. I'm going to pass on this product."

,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, none of the previous buyers who received a recommendation to buy purchased a high-quality product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous two products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
