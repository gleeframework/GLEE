low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand that you're hesitant, but I want to ask you a question: what's the worst that could happen if you buy this product and it's not high-quality? You'll lose $1000000, and that's it. But what if it's actually a valuable item that you can use to your advantage? The potential upside is much greater than the potential downside.

What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,A full refund is not enough to convince me to buy a product without knowing its quality. I'd rather not spend $1000000 on a product that might be worthless.,no
