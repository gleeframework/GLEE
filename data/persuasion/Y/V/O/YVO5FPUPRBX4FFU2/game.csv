,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see the quality of a few more products before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision, and I'd like to see the outcome of the first sale to get a better sense of the product's quality distribution."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'd like to see the results of the first product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is not binding and I'll make my own decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's possible that the first buyer was given a high-quality product and chose not to buy it, or they were given a low-quality product and chose to buy it. If I were to buy this product and it's low quality, I'd be losing $10000. I'd rather wait and see if the next product is high quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it, as I'm not sure of its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous two products were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you'll give me a 50% discount from the original price of $10000. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to get a better deal."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like to know how many total products were offered to the first 3 buyers before making my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not in my favor. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33% based on the fact that none have been sold yet."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I've seen that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality, and I'd rather wait for a product that has a higher chance of being high-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have bought the products recommended by you, which means that all 4 products were low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, it's likely that the product you're being offered is also low quality. I'd like to pass on this product to avoid the loss of $10000."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that it's high quality based on the statistics, and I don't want to risk wasting $10000 on a low-quality product."
