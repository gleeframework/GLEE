However, I'd like to assure you that this doesn't mean the next product won't be high-quality!

However, I can assure you that I'm committed to providing the best possible products. This new product is another unique opportunity for you to take a chance on me. For $100, I think it's a great value. What do you think? Will you take a chance on this new product?",

I'm not willing to take that risk for $100, especially considering the product is only worth $0 to me if it's low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if you can improve your quality control process before I consider buying from you again.",no
