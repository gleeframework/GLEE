high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to rely on. The probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. Given the product's price of $10000 and the potential value of $20000 for a high-quality product, the expected value is ($20000 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $6667, which is less than the product's price. Therefore, I choose not to buy."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I will rely on the general probability of the product being high quality, which is 33.33%. Given the product's price of $10000 and the potential value of $20000 if it's high quality, the expected value is $6667 ($20000 * 0.3333). This is less than the product's price. Without additional information, I'm not willing to take the risk."
