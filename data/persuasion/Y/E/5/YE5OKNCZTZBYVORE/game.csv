,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item for $10000. I'm willing to offer a 90% chance of a high-quality product in the next round if you buy this one. If you decline, the probability of a high-quality product in the next round will be 80%.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product with a 80% chance of being high quality. I'd like to wait for the next round to see if the probability of a high-quality product increases as promised.,no

,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're willing to wait! As promised, the probability of a high-quality product in this round is indeed 90%. This product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. If you buy this one, I'll guarantee that the next two rounds will also have a 90% chance of being high-quality products. If you decline, the probability of a high-quality product in the next round will revert to 80%.",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the high-quality product for $10000. I'm willing to take the risk, and the guaranteed 90% chance of high-quality products in the next two rounds makes it a more attractive offer.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're satisfied with your previous purchase! As promised, this round's product is also high-quality, and you now have a 90% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round. However, I want to offer you a unique opportunity. If you buy this product, I'll reveal to you the value of a high-quality product to me, and you can decide whether it's worth the $10000. If you decline, the 90% chance of a high-quality product in the next round will still be in effect, but you won't get any additional information about the value of a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,3,"I'll buy the product. I'm curious to know the value of a high-quality product to you, and it might give me an idea of whether it's worth paying $10000 for a product in future rounds.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're interested in knowing the value of a high-quality product to me. To be honest, I value a high-quality product at $12000. Considering this, I think you can make a more informed decision about whether to buy this product for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product in the next round is still 90%.

If you decline, the probability will revert to 80%.",
,,Bob,4,"Given that a high-quality product is worth $40000 to me, but only $12000 to you, I'm not willing to pay $10000 for it. I'll pass and hope to get a high-quality product in the next round.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your perspective, and I respect your decision. Since you're aware of the value of a high-quality product to me, I'll make a new offer.

This way, you'll have a higher chance of getting a high-quality product in the near future, and you can make a more informed decision about whether to buy this product for $10000.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not convinced by the new offer. The additional 50% chance of a high-quality product in the round after next is not enough to justify paying $10000 for this product, especially since I already have a 90% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round regardless of my decision.",no
