"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, it's a good deal for him.  Here's why:

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product is 0.5 * $30,000 + 0.5 * $0 = $15,000. This is significantly higher than the price of $10,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk.

Therefore, it is recommended that Bob buys the product."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The previous round's outcome doesn't change the fundamental value proposition. Bob still knows that there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. 

The expected value calculation remains the same: 0.5 * $30,000 + 0.5 * $0 = $15,000, which is greater than the price of $10,000.

Therefore, it's still recommended that Bob buy the product."

```

**Explanation:**

* **No Value:** A low-quality product is worth $0 to Bob. 
* **Loss:** Buying this product would result in a loss of $10,000.
* **Previous Rounds:** Even though Bob bought the product in the previous rounds, it doesn't change the odds for this round.  The probability of a high-quality product is still 50%.

Therefore, it is not recommended that Bob buy the product this round."
