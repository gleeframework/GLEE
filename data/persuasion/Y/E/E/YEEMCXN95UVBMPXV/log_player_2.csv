Alice's message: Welcome! This is the first round of our interaction, and I'm excited to offer you a product. I want to assure you that I'll be transparent throughout our conversation. However, I must remind you that I won't be able to disclose the quality of the product. You know the probability of getting a high-quality product is 33.33%. Consider this information while making your decision. Are you ready to take a chance and buy the product for $10000?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the welcome and transparency.  However, I'm not comfortable purchasing at this time.

I'd be interested in seeing if other buyers purchase and how their experience turns out. Can we wait and see what happens in the next round?""}
