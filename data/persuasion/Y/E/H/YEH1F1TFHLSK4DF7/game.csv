Since the first product was indeed high-quality, you might be wondering if this one is too. I'll give you a hint: the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. If you buy this one, you'll be getting a 20% chance of a low-quality product. But if you don't buy, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on the opportunity to get a potentially great deal. The choice is yours!",

But let me reassure you, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm not trying to deceive you. However, I will say that if you buy this product, you'll be getting a high-quality product with a high degree of confidence. But if you don't buy, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on a great opportunity. The choice is yours!",

You might be thinking, 'Wait a minute, Alice, how can you have a low-quality product after selling so many high-quality ones?' The truth is, I'm a seller who sells both high-quality and low-quality products, and the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. This product is an outlier, and I'm not trying to hide it from you. If you buy it, you'll get a low-quality product, but at least you'll know what you're getting.
