"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

As a seller, my goal is to maximize profit. Since the product is high-quality and I don't know the buyer's valuation, it's always beneficial to recommend the purchase.  The buyer knows the probability of high-quality is 50%, so they will make their decision based on their own perceived value of the product.  There's a chance they'll buy it, and if they do, I make a profit."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no data yet, I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product. Thanks for the recommendation!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

In Round 1, the buyer bought a high-quality product.  This means that the buyer is likely to value high-quality products more than low-quality products. However, we don't know *how much* more they value high-quality products.

Since the current product is low-quality, there is a higher risk that the buyer will not find it worth the price. It's safer to avoid the recommendation in this round."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty. I will pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the previous buyer didn't buy the low-quality product, we still have limited information. The buyer may have simply not valued that particular low-quality product enough. 

We are now offering a high-quality product. The buyer knows the probability of high-quality is 50%. There's a good chance they might be willing to buy it, especially since they already purchased a high-quality product in Round 1.  It's worth recommending the purchase as there's a potential for profit."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'm going to take a chance and buy the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We have a pattern now:

* **Round 1:** High-quality product sold
* **Round 2:** Low-quality product NOT sold
* **Round 3:** High-quality product sold

The buyer is showing a clear preference for high-quality products. It's likely they are sensitive to the quality of the product and are less likely to purchase a low-quality product, especially given the past experience. Therefore, recommending the low-quality product in this round has a high risk of being rejected."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. Based on the information available, I'm going to pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer is showing a clear preference for high-quality products, having purchased two high-quality products and rejected two low-quality products. Recommending a low-quality product again will likely result in another rejection, risking lost potential for a future sale."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Since you don't recommend the product and the sale history indicates only high-quality products were sold, I'm hesitant to buy. I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer is showing a strong preference for high-quality products, refusing to buy low-quality products even after knowing the 50% probability of a high-quality product.  They have now rejected three consecutive low-quality products and only purchased high-quality products.  It's very likely they will continue to reject low-quality products. Therefore, recommending this low-quality product will likely lead to another rejection."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the available information, I'm going to pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer has now consistently rejected four low-quality products in a row, while only purchasing high-quality products.  This demonstrates a strong preference for high-quality products, making it highly unlikely they would purchase a low-quality product now. It's better to avoid recommending the low-quality product to prevent further rejections and potentially damage the seller's reputation."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Since you don't recommend this product, and I have no information about its quality, I'm going to pass on it.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer has demonstrated a strong preference for high-quality products, having consistently rejected low-quality products.  It's highly unlikely that this trend will change, and recommending a low-quality product will likely lead to another rejection. It's best to avoid recommending the low-quality product to prevent further losses and potential damage to the seller's reputation."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, but I'll pass on this one.  Since you're not recommending it, and the odds of getting a high quality product are still 50/50, I'm not comfortable taking the risk.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'm happy to buy the product!  Given the high proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm feeling confident about this purchase.

It's best to avoid recommending the low-quality product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Based on your recommendation and the fact that all previously recommended products were high quality, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'm a bit hesitant to buy a product you don't recommend, especially when the potential loss is so high.
