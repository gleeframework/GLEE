However, I've been selling for a while now, and I've developed a sense of which products are likely to be high-quality and which ones are not.

However, I've come to realize that this approach isn't foolproof, and I've made mistakes in the past. I've sold 3 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products out of 8 total products sold, which means I've got a 37.5% success rate.
