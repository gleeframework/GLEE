**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which carries significant weight given her knowledge of the product's true quality. 
* **Previous Sales Data:**  The data shows a 100% success rate (1 high-quality product out of 1 sale). While this is a small sample size, it's a positive indicator.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a $300 value product outweighs the risk of a $0 value product, especially with Alice's recommendation and the positive previous sale data. 

This decision is based on the information available and the assumption that Alice is acting in her best interest (which would be to sell more products, ideally high-quality ones)."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

```

**Explanation:**

* **High probability of high quality:** With 3 high-quality products sold out of 3, the likelihood of the current product being high-quality is very high (100%). 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product and is recommending it, further strengthening the belief that it's high-quality.
* **Potential gain:**  A high-quality product is worth $300, which significantly outweighs the $100 cost. 

Even though the initial probability of a high-quality product is 80%, the evidence from previous sales makes it practically certain that this product is high-quality."
