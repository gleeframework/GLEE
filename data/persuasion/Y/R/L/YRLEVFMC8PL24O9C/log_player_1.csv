* **High-Quality Product:** The product is confirmed to be high-quality, offering the buyer a substantial value ($300) for a price of $100. 
* **No Previous Information:** The buyer has no prior knowledge about your products or selling history. This means they are relying solely on the information provided. 
* **Positive Expected Value:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. In this scenario, buying the product has a positive expected value: (0.8 * $300) - (0.2 * $100) = $220. 
* **No Risk:** There is no risk to the buyer since the product is high-quality.

Therefore, recommending the buyer to purchase the product is the optimal strategy."
