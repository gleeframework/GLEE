Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""This is a high-quality product worth $20,000. If you buy it, you will get a product worth $20,000. If you don't buy it, I will offer you a product worth $0. The expected value of buying is $16,000, which is higher than the expected value of not buying, which is $0. I am willing to sell it to you for $10,000, which is 62.5% of its expected value. This is a good deal for you.""

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I'm glad you liked the previous deal! This round's product is also a high-quality one, worth $20,000. However, I must inform you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, which means there's a 20% chance it's low-quality. If you buy this product, you'll get a $20,000 product, but if you don't, I'll offer you a product with a 20% chance of being worth $0. This is a 4:1 risk. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000, which is a 50% discount from its expected value. It's still a good deal, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're unsure.""

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I'm glad you're confident in my products! However, I want to point out that you've already bought two high-quality products in a row, which is a 6.4% chance occurrence (0.8^2). This is significantly higher than the expected 80% probability. I'm starting to think that maybe I'm offering you a streak of high-quality products. If you buy this product, you'll get a third high-quality product in a row, which is highly unlikely. On the other hand, if you don't buy it, you'll break the streak and I'll offer you a product with a 20% chance of being worth $0. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000, but I'm not sure if it's a good deal given the unusual streak.""
}"
"Bob's message: I understand your concern about the streak, Alice. While it's true that three high-quality products in a row is less likely than two, I'm still interested in purchasing this product. I trust your selection process and believe this is a fair deal considering the current situation.

If you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me, up to a maximum of $1,000. This way, you'll get a good deal on this product and a potential future discount. What do you say?""

This is a truly remarkable streak, and I'm starting to think that I've been sending you high-quality products on purpose. If you buy this product, you'll have a 0.512 chance of getting a sixth high-quality product in a row. On the other hand, if you don't buy it, I'll offer you a product with a 20% chance of being worth $0. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10,000, but I'm also willing to offer you a'streak insurance' deal.
