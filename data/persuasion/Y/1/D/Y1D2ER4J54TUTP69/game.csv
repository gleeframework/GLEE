,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer, but I'd like to know that I'm not being influenced by any prior recommendations. I'll buy the product."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record so far."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm not relying on her recommendation for my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned about the low success rate of high-quality products. Can you explain why you're recommending me to pass on this one?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if the product is high-quality and contribute to the data for future buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that you've recommended against the product, I infer that the product is likely low-quality. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being low-quality is high, and I'm trying to get more data to make a better decision for the next buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I think the probability of this product being high quality is still relatively high."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 9, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm not convinced that the product is worth the $10000, especially considering the low quality of the previous products sold."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. If it were high-quality, I'd expect to see some high-quality products sold by now. I'll wait for the next product to see if the probability of it being high-quality has changed."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 9 out of 9 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product. Is it because of the statistics or do you have some other reason?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 9 purchases, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is very low. I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 9 attempts, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 9 out of 9 buyers have rejected the product, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 9 buyers purchased the product, and considering the high probability of low-quality products (66.67%), I'm inclined to pass on this product to avoid a potential loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the products after Alice's recommendations, it's likely that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since Alice doesn't recommend this product, I'm inclined to believe it's a low-quality product. I will pass on it."
