,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I'll rely on the general probability of the product being high quality, which is 33.33%. Given that I don't have any additional information, the expected value of buying the product is $12500 * 0.3333 - $10000 = -$1583.25 (a negative expected value), so I'll choose not to buy it."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,yes,I'll take my chances since there's no previous sales data and a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product is worth the risk given the potential gain.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,yes,I'll take my chances since the price is lower than the value of a high-quality product and your past record isn't extremely bad.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I won't buy the product because the probability of it being high quality is only 33.33% and only 1 out of 3 sold products were of high quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"The probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% and only 1 out of 3 products sold so far was high-quality.
