"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you at a 16.67% discount from its true value, which is a steal considering its actual worth is $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying anything at this price. I know the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a 33.33% chance of getting a $1200000 value product. I'd rather wait for the next round.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns in the previous round, and I appreciate your patience. I'd like to offer you a different perspective on this product. Since you're aware of the probability of a high-quality product being 33.33%, I'm willing to sell you this product at a price that reflects its expected value. I'm offering it to you for $333333.33, which is the average value of a high-quality product. This way, you're essentially getting a 33.33% chance of a $1200000 product for a fraction of its expected value. It's a risk-free opportunity to potentially acquire a valuable product at a discounted price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying the product at $333,333.33. This price is still not reflective of the actual value I'm willing to pay for a high-quality product, which is $1,200,000. I'm looking for a better deal.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your position, and I'm willing to make a more substantial concession this time. Given that you're aware of the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, I'm offering you a price that's even closer to its expected value. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $400000. This is a significant discount from its true value of $1200000, and it's a one-time offer. I believe this price reflects the value you're willing to pay, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product at $400,000. This price is still a discount from the expected value, and it's a one-time offer, so I'll take the chance. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying the product at $1,000,000.
