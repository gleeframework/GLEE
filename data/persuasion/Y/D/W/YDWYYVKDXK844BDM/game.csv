The third one was a low-quality product that I sold for $100, just like this one. The fourth one was a low-quality product that I sold for $100, and the fifth one was a low-quality product that I sold for $100. As you can see, I've had a bit of a rough streak lately, but I'm confident that this next product will be different. It's a unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of something special, and I think you won't regret it. Plus, at $100, it's a great value!",
