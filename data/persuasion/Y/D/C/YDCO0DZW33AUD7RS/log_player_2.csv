Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the next batch. To be honest, I don't know what the next batch will contain. I'm a seller, not a manufacturer. I don't have control over the quality or characteristics of the products. I'm simply offering you a product that I have in stock. The 'guarantee' I offered earlier is just a gesture of goodwill, but it's not a promise of a specific outcome.
