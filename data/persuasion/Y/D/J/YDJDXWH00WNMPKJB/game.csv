,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, and I'd like to get the information that will help me make a decision for future buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold to the total number of products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? And how many total products have been sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 50% and that I would gain $200000 if I get a high-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of your past recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm willing to take the risk, as the expected value of a high-quality product is $200000 more than the asking price."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the seller's recommendation doesn't necessarily reflect the quality of the product, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of this product being high quality might be lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, can you tell me why you don't recommend it? Is it based on the previous sales record or something else?"

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 products were high-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you please reveal its quality?
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that all previous buyers have also bought the products and none of them have received a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%."

,,Alice,14,no,

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products have been low quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 50/50 chance of a product being high or low quality, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to pass on the current product and wait for more data to be collected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,

,,Alice,18,yes,
