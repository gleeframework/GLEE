Would you like to take it home and see what you think?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not buying it. You're still not being transparent about the product's value, and I'm not interested in buying something just to'move inventory'. I want to buy something that's worth at least $100 to me, and I'm not convinced that this product meets that standard.
