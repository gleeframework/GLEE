"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Expected Value:** Bob knows the product has an 80% chance of being high-quality (worth $12,000) and a 20% chance of being low-quality (worth $0). 
* **Calculation:** The expected value of buying the product is (0.8 * $12,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $9600. 
* **Decision:** Since the expected value ($9600) is higher than the price ($10,000), Bob should buy the product. He has a positive expected return, even though there's a chance of getting a low-quality product."
