,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is against it. I'm willing to take the risk, as I think the potential reward outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products (since no high-quality products were sold), I'm going to assume that the current product is likely to be low-quality as well. I don't want to risk wasting $1000000 on a product that's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll make my own decision based on the probability of a high-quality product."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is very low, and I don't want to risk wasting $1000000 on a low-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers bought the product after your recommendation, and all of them were high-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that this product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm concerned that the probability of it being high-quality is low."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far.
