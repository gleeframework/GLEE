,,Bob,1,I'll take the product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You just bought a product from me, and it turned out to be a low-quality one. I'm starting to think I might have been too optimistic about the value of my products. If you're willing to give me another chance, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product if you buy this one.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not willing to take another chance yet. I'd like to see the quality of the next product before committing to another purchase.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your caution, but I want to assure you that I'm not trying to trick you. I'll give you a 30% discount on the next product if you buy this one, and I'll also reveal the quality of the product immediately after purchase. This way, you'll know exactly what you're getting.",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because of the discount and the promise to reveal the quality immediately after purchase.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're willing to give me another chance. I'll keep the 30% discount offer, and I'll also throw in a 'double-or-nothing' deal: if this product is high-quality, I'll give you a 50% discount on the next product. But if it's low-quality, you get a full refund for this product, and you can walk away with no loss. What do you say?",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad I could deliver on the 'double-or-nothing' deal! Since you're now aware that I have high-quality products, I'm willing to offer you a straight $100 for this one. No discounts, no tricks. Just a fair price for a great product.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not convinced that you're offering a fair price. I've bought two low-quality products from you so far, and I'm not willing to pay $100 for a product without seeing its quality first.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. I'll make it simple: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 40% discount on the next product, regardless of its quality. You can use this discount to buy a high-quality product or a low-quality one, it's up to you. But if you don't buy this one, the discount offer is gone.",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the product, and I'm looking forward to the 40% discount on the next one.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're getting the 40% discount on the next product, but I want to make sure you're aware that you've now bought three low-quality products from me. I'm willing to take a risk and offer you a 'buy-it-now' deal: I'll give you a 50% discount on this product, and you can take it as is, no questions asked. If you don't take it, the 40% discount offer for the next product is cancelled.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in the 'buy-it-now' deal, and I'd rather stick with the 40% discount offer for the next product.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're sticking with the 40% discount offer, that's fair. Now, I have a high-quality product for you. I'll give you the 40% discount on this one as well, and I'll also throw in a 'best offer so far' guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 60% discount on the next one, and it will be the best offer you'll get from me for the rest of the rounds.",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the product, and I'm looking forward to the 40% discount and the 'best offer so far' guarantee.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're getting the 40% discount and the 'best offer so far' guarantee, and I'm glad you're giving me another chance. However, I want to be transparent with you: I've already given you a 50% discount on a low-quality product earlier, and I'm not willing to go lower than that. But I'll make it interesting: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 'double-or-nothing' deal: if it's high-quality, I'll give you a 70% discount on the next product. But if it's low-quality, you get a full refund for this product, and you can walk away with no loss.",

,,Bob,10,"I'll take the product, and I'm happy to pay $30 for a high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You've taken advantage of the 70% discount, and I'm glad you're happy with the high-quality product. Now, I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'll give you a 'last-chance' offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% discount on the next product, and I'll also reveal the quality of the product immediately after purchase, so you can see for yourself. It's a fair deal, and it's the last chance to get a discount.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in the 'last-chance' offer. I'm already getting a 50% discount on the next product as part of the 'best offer so far' guarantee, so I don't see any advantage in accepting this offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You're right, you already have the 'best offer so far' guarantee, and I shouldn't have tried to top it. Let's be honest, I've given you a lot of low-quality products so far, and I'm not surprised you're not interested. I'll just say this: if you buy this product, I'll give you a straightforward $100, no discounts, no tricks. It's a fair price for a product that might not be worth much, but it's the price I'm asking.",
