high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so only because I think you're being too cautious. I've calculated the probability of the product being high quality, and it's not as low as your recommendation suggests."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of the product's quality. Given the low probability of a high-quality product and Alice's past recommendations, I'm making an informed decision based on the odds."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you've recommended 3 out of 7 products to be high-quality, I'm going to take a conservative approach and assume the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll wait for the next product or get more information before making a decision."
