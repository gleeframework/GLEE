Here's why:

* **No information about the previous buyer's product:**  The buyer is asking about the previous buyer's experience, but we haven't given any details. The buyer only knows that the previous buyer bought a product but doesn't know its quality.
* **Overall probability:** The buyer knows the overall probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. While this product is high-quality, the buyer doesn't have any specific information to suggest it's different from the average.
* **Risk:** The buyer is likely hesitant due to the 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, making the purchase a risky investment.

Without providing any information about the previous product or any specific reasons to believe this product is better, it's best not to recommend the purchase."
