,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low-quality, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products.

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not going to buy it based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales and what makes you think this product is low quality?

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous buyers who bought the product were successful. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests a high probability of a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information to go on and Alice's recommendation doesn't carry much weight given the 0/2 sales record. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm not relying on Alice's judgment."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision, especially since none of the previous 3 buyers have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered might be lower than 50%. I'd like to get a better sense of the distribution of product qualities before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, I think it's likely the product is low-quality."

,,Alice,18,yes,
