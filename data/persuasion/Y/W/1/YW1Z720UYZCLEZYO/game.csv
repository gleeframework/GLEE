high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy it, but I'm not sure if it's high quality or low quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll buy it, since I already know that at least one product is high quality and the odds are still in my favor."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I've already bought two high-quality products, so the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 80%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I've bought three high-quality products in a row, but I'm not going to get complacent. The probability of the next one being high-quality is still 80%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I've bought four high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely. I'm starting to suspect that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality, so I'll pass this time."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I was wrong to pass last time, and I'm back to not knowing the quality of the remaining products. I'll take the chance again."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I've bought five high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely. I'm starting to think that the probability of the next one being low-quality is actually higher than 20%. Still, I'll take the chance."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"Six high-quality products in a row is almost impossible. I think the probability of the next one being low-quality is now significantly higher than 20%, so I'll pass this time."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I was wrong again, and I'm starting to think that Alice has a way of selecting the high-quality products. I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row is absurd. I think Alice is somehow manipulating the selection process, so I'll just go along with it and keep buying."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"Alice is recommending against this one, but I've seen her recommend against a high-quality product before. I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"I just lost $100 on a low-quality product, and I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are not as reliable as they seemed. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I was wrong again, and I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually based on the product's quality. I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Eight high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that Alice is actually giving me good advice. I'll keep buying."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm on a hot streak, and I'm starting to think that Alice knows what she's doing. I'll keep buying."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,I'm not going to question my luck now. I'll keep buying and see how long this streak lasts.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,I'm 10 for 10 on high-quality products. I'm not going to stop now. Keep 'em coming!
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,no,"Alice is recommending against this one, and I'm starting to think that she's finally figured out that I'm buying all the high-quality products. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I just dodged a bullet, and I'm glad I passed on the last one. Now I'll take the chance and buy this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I've made it to the final round, and I'm going to keep my streak going. I'll buy this one and see if I can end on a high note."
