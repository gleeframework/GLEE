,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, as I'm a rational buyer and I know the true probabilities."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would make me the first one to buy a low-quality product and thus update the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning for not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your recommendation and the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers were able to get a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'm also worried that Alice might be trying to hide the fact that the product is low quality. Can you tell me more about your previous sales record and why you're not recommending it?"

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on the fact that none of the previous 6 products were high-quality, which suggests a low-quality product is more likely to be the current product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have purchased the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that all the products sold so far are low-quality. Given the 50/50 chance of a product being high-quality, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd like to pass on the product and hope to get a better deal or more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better."

,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, 8 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'm going to pass on this product."
