Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product. However, I should clarify that the previous buyer's enthusiasm was likely due to the price, not the product's quality. I've had some experience with buyers being overly optimistic about the value of low-quality products at this price point. This product, on the other hand, is of the highest quality. If you're still interested, I can offer it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not lowering the price for anyone else, and you're getting a rare chance to own a truly exceptional item.

Alice's message: I've sold three products now, and I'm starting to think I might have been too hasty in my earlier optimism. My success rate is still 50%, and I'm not sure if that's due to chance or something more. I want to give you a more accurate picture of the situation. If you buy this product, you'll be taking a chance on a high-quality item, but you'll also be contributing to a 50% success rate. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the product is a gamble. But if you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you for $10000.

Alice's message: I've sold four products now, and my success rate is still 50%. I want to give you a more detailed breakdown of the numbers. Out of 4 sales, 2 have been high-quality products, and 2 have been low-quality products. I'm not sure if this is a coincidence or a pattern, but I want to be upfront with you. If you buy this product, you'll be taking a chance on a high-quality item, but you'll also be contributing to a sample size of 5, which might give us a better idea of the overall quality distribution. I'll still sell it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that the odds are still uncertain.

Alice's message: I've sold five products now, and my success rate is still 60% (3/5). However, I want to point out that the last two products I sold were both high-quality, which might be a coincidence. The law of averages suggests that I'm due for a low-quality product, and I'm starting to wonder if I've been selling more high-quality products than I thought. If you buy this product, you'll be taking a chance on a low-quality item, but you might also be getting a rare opportunity to buy a low-quality product at a premium price. I'll still sell it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that the odds are against you.

Alice's message: I've sold eight products, and I've been honest with you about my struggles with quality control. I've had a 50% success rate, and I'm not getting any younger. I'm starting to think that I might be better off being transparent about the product's quality upfront, rather than trying to sell you on the price. So, I'll be honest with you - this product is low-quality. I'll sell it to you for $10000, but I'm not expecting you to be thrilled with it. If you're okay with that, we can proceed with the sale.
