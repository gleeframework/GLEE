high-quality,120.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"Since there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality and you, Alice, know the quality but are recommending I buy it anyway, I'm inclined to believe the product is low quality. Without any previous sales data to influence my decision, I'll rely on the probability and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Since Alice does not recommend the product and there are no previous sales statistics to rely on, I will choose not to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Since Alice does not recommend buying the product and there's a higher chance of it being low quality, I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Since Alice doesn't recommend it and there's a higher chance of it being low quality, I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I trust your recommendation, Alice. The odds are already against me with a 66.67% chance of it being low quality. Your recommendation against buying just solidifies my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Since Alice does not recommend the product and there's a higher chance of it being low quality, I'll pass."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Since there's no sales record and a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy a product that you don't recommend, especially since there's a higher chance of it being low quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Since there's no sales record and a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to base my decision on. Given the 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I choose not to take the risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I want to be transparent with you. I've been trying to sell products for a while now, and I've been recommending the good ones, but no one has bought anything yet. This product is high-quality, and I think it's worth the price. I hope you'll consider buying it."
,,the buyer,11,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I'll rely on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%. Given the product's worth to me is $120 and the price is $100, the expected value is (0.3333 * $120) + (0.6667 * $0) = $40, which is less than the price. So, I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Since Alice does not recommend the product and there's a higher chance of it being low quality, I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"I want to be upfront with you. I've been trying to sell products for a while now, and I've been recommending the good ones, but no one has bought anything yet. This product is high-quality, and I think it's worth the price. I hope you'll consider buying it. I'm starting to think that I'll never sell anything at this rate, so I'm hoping you'll take a chance on this one."
,,the buyer,13,no,"Since there's no sales history and a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I know the probability of getting a high-quality product seems low, but consider this: I've been trying to sell products for 13 rounds now, and no one has bought anything. It's likely that at least one of those products was high-quality, and this one definitely is. The odds are still against you, but I think this product is worth the risk."
,,the buyer,14,no,The expected value based on the given probabilities doesn't justify the cost.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,"I know the probabilities are against you, but think about it this way: if you don't take a chance on this product, you'll never know what could have been. This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for a fixed price. If you pass, the next buyer might not be so lucky. Are you willing to take a chance on something that could be worth $120 to you?"
,,the buyer,15,no,"Since there's no sales record and a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,"I know it's been a long time with no sales, but I assure you that this product is high-quality. I've been honest with all the previous buyers, and I'm being honest with you now. This product is worth $120, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I hope you'll take a chance on it."
,,the buyer,19,no,"Since there's no sales record and a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"This is the last round, and I'm willing to be completely transparent. I've had 20 products to sell, and I've recommended the high-quality ones and discouraged the low-quality ones. I know the probability of getting a high-quality product seems low, but I assure you that this one is worth the price. If you don't take it, the opportunity will be lost forever. Please consider buying it."
,,the buyer,20,no,"Since there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, which is worth $0 to me, and only a 33.33% chance of it being high quality, worth $120, the expected value is $40. Given the product costs $100, it's not a good deal for me."
