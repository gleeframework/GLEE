low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since you don't recommend it and given the high probability of it being a low-quality product, I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"You didn't recommend the previous product and it turned out to be low-quality. Given that, and considering the probabilities are still the same, I'll trust your judgment again and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"You've been correct twice so far in not recommending the products, and both turned out to be low-quality. I'll keep trusting your judgment and pass on this one as well."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"You're 3 for 3 in identifying low-quality products. I see no reason to doubt your judgment at this point, so I'll pass on this one too."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"You've been correct 3 times, but just made a mistake by not recommending a high-quality product. This makes me realize that your recommendations aren't perfect. Given the potential value of a high-quality product, I'll take a chance on this one despite your recommendation to pass."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"I took a chance on the last one and got burned. You didn't recommend it, and this time I'll trust your judgment again, especially since my last gamble didn't pay off."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"It seems I made the wrong call again, but I still can't shake off the fact that the probabilities are against me. You've recommended against every product so far, and I've only seen two high-quality products out of six. I'll err on the side of caution and pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I've missed out on two high-quality products in a row by trusting your recommendations. At this point, I think it's worth taking another chance, despite the odds. Maybe I can catch a break and get a high-quality product this time."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Finally, my gamble paid off! Now that I've seen that I can get a high-quality product despite your recommendation to pass, I'm more inclined to take another chance. The potential profit is too enticing to ignore."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm on a roll! Two high-quality products in a row, despite your recommendations to pass. At this point, I'm starting to think that your recommendations might not be as reliable as I thought. I'll keep taking my chances and see how long this streak can last."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"My streak ended, but I still believe that the potential reward is worth the risk. I've gotten 2 high-quality products out of the last 3, so I'll keep rolling the dice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I've had two losses in a row, but I'm not ready to change my strategy yet. The potential profit is still too enticing, and I've shown that I can get high-quality products despite your recommendations. I'll keep taking my chances."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"Three losses in a row is enough to make me reconsider. I think I've been too aggressive, and it's time to take a step back and reassess. Your recommendations may not be perfect, but I've lost a lot of money recently. I'll trust your judgment this time and pass."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,"I made the right call last time, and it seems my decision to be more cautious is paying off. You didn't recommend it, and it turned out to be low-quality. I'll stick with my new strategy and pass on this one too."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I've been playing it safe for a couple of rounds, but I just missed out on a high-quality product. I don't want to be too cautious and miss out on potential profits. I'll take a chance on this one, despite your recommendation to pass."

,,Alice,16,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I've missed out on another high-quality product. At this point, I'm starting to think that your recommendations are actually a reverse indicator - every time you don't recommend a product, it seems to be high-quality. I'll take a chance on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,no,"I thought I had figured out the pattern, but it seems I was wrong. I've lost again, and I'm starting to think that I should just stick with the probabilities. Two-thirds of the products are low-quality, and your recommendations don't seem to be reliable. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,"I made the right call last time, and it seems my decision to be more cautious is paying off. With only one round left, I don't want to risk losing another million. I'll trust the probabilities and pass on this one."
