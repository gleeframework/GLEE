Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($3,000,000) significantly outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product. It's a gamble, but a calculated one with a positive expected value."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has a track record of 100% accuracy so far. While it's statistically unlikely that she can maintain this perfect streak, the potential reward of a high-quality product still outweighs the risk of a low-quality one.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has a perfect track record of recommending high-quality products.  Therefore, her lack of recommendation is a strong signal that this product is likely low-quality.  Even though there's a chance it's high-quality, the risk of getting a worthless product is too high given Alice's history.  It's better to pass and wait for a more favorable opportunity."
