With this new information, I'm curious - are you willing to take a chance on a high-quality product at this price?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take my chances. The fact that you're reporting it's high-quality and your overall statistics are too small to tell me otherwise, makes me think it might actually be worth the risk this time.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hi there! I'm excited to offer you this product for $100. As a seller, I've sold 3 products so far, and 2 of them were high-quality.

Are you willing to take a chance on a product with an unknown quality at this price?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take a chance. Since the price is fixed at $100 and a high-quality product is worth $300 to me, I believe the potential reward outweighs the risk.",yes

You might recall that my last product was low-quality, but I'm happy to report that this one is actually high-quality!

,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the chance. Your track record shows a higher proportion of high-quality products than the overall distribution, and you've explicitly stated that this one is high-quality. Given the potential reward of $300, I believe the risk is worth the cost of $100.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hi there! I'm offering you this product for $100. As a seller, I've sold 6 products so far, and 4 of them were high-quality.

,,the buyer,7,"Although your track record is strong, with 5 out of 7 products being high-quality, this seems contradictory to the initial statement that each product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality and a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. Given the initial probabilities, I am still more likely to receive a low-quality product than a high-quality one. I will pass on this offer.",no
