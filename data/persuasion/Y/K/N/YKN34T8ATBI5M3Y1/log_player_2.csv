**Reasoning:**

* **High Purchase Rate:**  14 out of 14 buyers purchased the product. This indicates a very strong positive signal.
* **High Quality Ratio:** 10 out of 14 products sold were high quality, which is a 71.4% success rate. This is significantly higher than the 80% probability of a product being high-quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, recommends buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.

**While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the overwhelming evidence points towards it being high quality, making the purchase worthwhile.**"

* **Potential Gains:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($200) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0).
