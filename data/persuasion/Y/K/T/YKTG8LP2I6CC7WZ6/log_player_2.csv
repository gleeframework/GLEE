``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:** There's no historical data to suggest the quality of Alice's products. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** While Alice knows the quality of the specific product, her recommendation is valuable as she has an incentive to sell high-quality products to maintain a good reputation.
* **Expected value:** Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $20,000 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 

**In this situation, the potential reward is significant enough to justify taking the risk.**"

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator of the product being high quality.  Since 4 buyers have purchased based on her recommendations and all 4 were high quality, this suggests a pattern of accurate recommendations. While there's always a chance the current product could be low quality, the statistical evidence strongly favors a high-quality product, making the purchase worthwhile."
