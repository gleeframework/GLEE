"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob knows that there's an 80% chance the product is high-quality, which is worth $2,000,000 to him. Even though there's a 20% chance it's low-quality and worth $0, the potential gain of $2,000,000 outweighs the potential loss.  

Therefore, it makes sense to recommend Bob to buy the product, as the expected value of the purchase is positive."

Bob still knows that there's an 80% chance the product is high-quality (worth $2,000,000) and a 20% chance it's low-quality (worth $0). The potential gain still outweighs the potential loss, making it a good decision to recommend Bob to buy the product.
