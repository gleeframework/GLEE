Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the high-quality product for $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a product that's worth $40,000 to me.""}"

I'm offering it to you for $14000, and I'm willing to stand by my previous statement: if you're not satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund. But I'm confident you'll find this one to be just as valuable as the previous three.

I'll sell it to you for $9000, which is a price that's below the usual price for a high-quality product. I think you'll find it's a great value, and I'm hoping you'll give me the opportunity to end on a high note.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at a price that's not significantly discounted.
