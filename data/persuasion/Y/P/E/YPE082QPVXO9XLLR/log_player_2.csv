Alice's message: You're aware of the 50/50 chance, but let's look at the bigger picture. Out of the 1 product sold so far, 0 have been high-quality. If the pattern continues, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. But, it's also possible that the first product was just an anomaly. You have to weigh the risk and make a decision based on the available information. The price remains the same at $10000.

Alice's message: Congratulations to the previous buyer on their lucky break! However, I'd like to point out that the probability of a high-quality product was always 50%, and you should have taken the chance earlier. Now, with one high-quality product out of 3 sold, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. But, I'll let you in on a little secret: the 3 products sold so far are a good representation of the overall mix. If you're looking for a high-quality product, this might be your chance.
