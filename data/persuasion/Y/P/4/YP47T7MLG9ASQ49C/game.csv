,,Alice,3,"Greetings! I understand your concern about product quality and transparency. In our store, the probability of receiving a high-quality product is 50%. Our current product is one of those, so there's a 50% chance it's high-quality and a 50% chance it's low-quality. Given the risk, I still invite you to consider the potential value of $200 if it turns out to be high-quality. The price remains at $100.

,,Alice,5,"Hello! I appreciate your cautious approach to purchasing. This product is indeed high-quality, and given its value of $200 once received, I understand why you might be hesitant.

I'd like to know if this is due to chance or if there's something else at play.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Hello! I appreciate your thorough analysis.
