,,Bob,1,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'd like to see the quality of a few more products before making a decision.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"No problem, I understand you want to be cautious. This product is also high-quality, and I'm still willing to sell it to you for $10000. Since you've already seen one high-quality product, I'm wondering if you might be willing to take a chance on another one. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you might miss out on a great opportunity. What do you say?",yes

I'm still willing to sell it to you, but I want to make it clear that it's not as good as the previous one. If you buy it, you'll be getting a product that's not up to par, and you might regret it. On the other hand, if you don't buy it, I'll just have to sell it to someone else, and you won't have to deal with a low-quality product. What do you say?",no

In fact, I'm not even sure it's worth half that price. I'm willing to let it go for a very low price, but I need to be upfront with you - it's not a good product. I'll sell it to you for $5000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you don't buy it, I'll just have to sell it to someone else, and you won't have to deal with it. What do you say?",no
