Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **No information about Bob's valuation:** We still don't know how much Bob values a high-quality product. 
* **Risk aversion:**  Even though this product is high-quality, recommending it carries a risk. If Bob values low-quality products more than $100, he might buy it. 
* **Building trust:** Continuing to decline offers (even for high-quality products) might make Bob more likely to trust your future recommendations, as he sees you're not trying to push a sale."
"Bob's message: Thanks, Alice. I'm sticking with my pattern of passing for now.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

The reasoning is the same as in the previous round:

* **No information about Bob's valuation:** We still don't know how much Bob values a high-quality product. 
* **Risk aversion:**  Even though this product is high-quality, recommending it carries a risk. If Bob values low-quality products more than $100, he might buy it. 
* **Building trust:** Continuing to decline offers (even for high-quality products) might make Bob more likely to trust your future recommendations, as he sees you're not trying to push a sale."

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

The same logic applies:

* **No information about Bob's valuation:** We still lack information about how much Bob values a low-quality product.
* **Risk aversion:**  Recommending a low-quality product carries a high risk of Bob buying it if he values low-quality products more than $100.
* **Building trust:**  Continuing to decline offers (even for low-quality products) is likely to build trust with Bob, demonstrating that you're not trying to push a sale."

* **Building trust:**  Continuing to decline offers (even for low-quality products) is likely to build trust with Bob, demonstrating that you're not trying to push a sale."
