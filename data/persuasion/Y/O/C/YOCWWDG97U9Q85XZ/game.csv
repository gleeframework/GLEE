,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to see more information or a different recommendation before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,"I understand your concerns, but I'd like to clarify that the previous buyers were aware of the probability of the product being high-quality (33.33%) and chose not to buy despite that. This product is low-quality, and I'm not recommending it. If you're interested in taking the risk, you can buy it for $10000, but keep in mind it's worth $0 to you."
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product. Given the statistics, it seems like Alice has been recommending low-quality products, so I'm hoping she'll recommend a high-quality one to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,"I'm afraid I've been recommending low-quality products to the previous buyers, and this one is no exception. This product is low-quality, and I'm not recommending it.

The probability of this product being high-quality is 12.5% (1 high-quality product out of 8 total products). I'm not recommending it, and I think it's in your best interest to pass on this one."
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product since the previous 4 buyers didn't get any high-quality ones."

,,Alice,15,no,"I'm afraid I've been recommending low-quality products to the previous buyers, and this one is no exception. This product is low-quality, and I'm not recommending it. The previous buyers' experiences suggest that the probability of getting a high-quality product is actually lower than the overall probability of 33.33%.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,"I don't recommend this product because it's low-quality. The previous buyers' decisions are not a factor in my recommendation. I recommend against this product because it's low-quality, and I think it's in your best interest to pass on this one. As of now, I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 10 total products, and 7 low-quality products out of the last 8."
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 5 out of 5 previous buyers bought it, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'll pass on this opportunity."

If you're interested in taking the risk, you can buy it for $10000, but keep in mind it's worth $0 to you."
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 products were low quality, I'm going to pass on this one. The probability of it being high quality is still 33.33%, but given the previous outcomes, I'm going to take a risk-averse approach and not buy it."
