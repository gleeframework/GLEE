,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because it's the first one and I have no prior information to go by. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and set the tone for the rest of the sales."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information to go on and I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality. I'm hoping for the best!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that the previous two products were low quality, which would mean the probability of the current product being high quality is higher than 50%. I'm taking a risk, but I'm hoping to get lucky!"

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I would like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision. The current proportion is 1/4, which is not enough to make a confident decision. I would like to pass on this product and wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice will reveal the product's quality after I've made my decision. I want to know whether it's high-quality or low-quality before I decide whether to keep it or pass it on to someone else."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that the recommendation is based on the quality of the product, not on the probability of the product being high-quality. Since there is only one high-quality product sold out of five, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather not rely on her recommendation and make my own decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 50%."
