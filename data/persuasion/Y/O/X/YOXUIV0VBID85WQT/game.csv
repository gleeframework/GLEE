low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high, and I don't want to pass up the chance to buy a potentially valuable product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products due to the lack of high-quality sales so far. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, but I'm curious about your reasoning behind not recommending it. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending me to buy the product. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product based on the previous sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations, I'm concerned that she may have a bias towards recommending low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one and see if I can get a better assessment from her."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that all previous buyers passed on the products, which would have resulted in a higher proportion of low-quality products being available. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm not confident in buying a product that Alice recommends, especially after seeing the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't trust your recommendation. I'll take the risk of it being low quality, but I'm hoping it's high quality. Can I get a discount? I'm willing to pay $900000 for it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 6 buyers have been offered the product, and none of them have bought a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers were not recommended to buy and no high-quality products were sold, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is very low. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm going to pass on the product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, it's likely that the products being recommended are low-quality. I'd like to see more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, is it a high-quality product or a low-quality product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6 purchases so far."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 7, I think it's likely that the product I'll be offered is low-quality, and I don't want to waste my $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 buyers have purchased the product despite no high-quality products being sold, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'm going to pass on this product."
