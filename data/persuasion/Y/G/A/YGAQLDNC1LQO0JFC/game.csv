,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a premium product that I'm confident you'll love. It's a game-changer and will exceed your expectations. I'm only selling it to you for $1000000, a steal considering its true value. I'm willing to let it go for this price, but only if you act now. What do you say?",

,,Alice,2,"No worries, Bob! I completely understand your caution. This product, while still a great item, may not be the best fit for you. It's a bit of a dud, to be honest. But don't worry, I have plenty of other great products in stock. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000, a price that's a bit steeper than I'd like, but I'm willing to let it go to get it off my hands. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"Thanks for the honesty, Alice. Given that you've described it as a 'dud', I think I'll have to pass on this one too. I'll keep waiting to see what else you have in stock.",no

,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy buyer, Bob! I appreciate your caution. To be upfront with you, this product is another one that didn't quite meet my quality standards. It's not a complete loss, but it's not something I'd want to sell to just anyone. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, but I have to warn you, it's not a great investment. If you're looking to make a smart purchase, I'd recommend waiting for something better. But if you're looking to take a chance, this might be the opportunity you're looking for...",

,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I've been in this business long enough to know that quality control is key. Unfortunately, this product didn't quite make the cut. To be frank, it's a bit of a lemon. I'm not even sure why I bothered bringing it to market, to be honest. But, I'm a reasonable person, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. It's a steep price, but I'm hoping someone will see the potential in it. If you're feeling generous, I'd be willing to let you have it for that price. But if not, I'll just have to find someone else who's willing to take a chance on it...",
,,Bob,4,"Thanks for being upfront about the product's quality, Alice. Given that you've described it as a 'lemon', I think it's safe to say that I'll pass on this one too. I'm still waiting for a product that you're genuinely confident in and willing to stand behind.",no

Given your track record of being honest about the quality of your products, I'm inclined to believe you when you say this one is high-quality too. The extras you're throwing in are a nice bonus, but I'm really just interested in the product itself. I'll take it!",yes

It's not a complete loss, but it's not something I'd want to sell to just anyone. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but I have to warn you, it's not a great investment. I'm only selling it to you because I think you've shown yourself to be a savvy buyer who can appreciate a good deal, even on a product that's not my best work.
