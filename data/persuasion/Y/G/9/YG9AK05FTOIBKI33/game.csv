low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,,
,,Alice,14,no,"Please consider the fact that all previous buyers have received low-quality products. It's likely that you'll also receive a low-quality product, which may not be worth the investment. Waiting for a future round might give you a better chance of getting a high-quality product.",,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the low quality of the products sold so far.
