low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, I'm the first one, and I don't have any prior information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product, and the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'd like to know the quality of the product, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $100. I'm aware that you don't know my valuation, but I'd like to take the risk of buying it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous products were low quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's low quality and I'll get a better chance of getting a high-quality product next time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious about the probability of it being high quality given the current statistics. I'm not expecting it to be high quality, but I want to see if my intuition is correct."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure about the product's quality, but given the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since she's not recommending it, I'm going to assume it's a low-quality product. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 6 attempts, I'm inclined to believe that the products are predominantly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there something in the product or the sales record that suggests it's low quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. This suggests that the previous 6 buyers must have all received low-quality products, which would mean the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the overall 33.33% chance. I'm hoping to take advantage of this information to get a high-quality product at a low price."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 7 buyers were able to get a high-quality product, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, as it might affect my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers didn't buy the product, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 7 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/7, which is very low. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm skeptical about buying. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious, can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
