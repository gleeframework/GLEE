Alice's message: Five low-quality products in a row? I think it's safe to say I've got a bad streak going on. I'm starting to wonder if I should just be upfront and say 'this is probably a low-quality product'... but that's not exactly the most convincing sales pitch.

But let me ask you, are you willing to take a chance on a seller who's clearly not doing a great job?
