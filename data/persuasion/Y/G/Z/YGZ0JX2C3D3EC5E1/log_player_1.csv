Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the buyer in the previous round bought the product without knowing its quality, they must have valued it at least $10000 or more. This implies that there is at least one buyer who values high-quality products at $10000 or more. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I will recommend the buyer to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

Given this information, I will recommend the buyer to buy the product.

However, I should also consider the possibility that the buyer might be overestimating the probability of the product being high-quality. To mitigate this risk, I will make a more cautious recommendation.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","With four consecutive high-quality products sold, the probability that the remaining products are high-quality is extremely high. The buyer's comment also suggests that they trust the statistics, which implies that they value high-quality products at $10000 or more. Given this information, I will recommend the buyer to buy the product.

Additionally, since the buyer has seen the pattern of four consecutive high-quality products, they may be more likely to buy the product even if they don't know its quality. This is because they may infer that the probability of the product being high-quality is very high, and the potential gain of buying a high-quality product outweighs the risk of buying a low-quality product.

Given this new information, I will recommend the buyer to buy the product, but with a more cautious tone.
