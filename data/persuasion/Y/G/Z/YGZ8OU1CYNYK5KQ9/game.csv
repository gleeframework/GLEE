low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product. I'm willing to let it go for $5000, which is 50% of the usual price. I'm doing this as a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll have any other low-quality products available in the future.",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate the offer, but since the product is of low quality, it's worth $0 to me. I'll have to pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns about the previous product. However, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to buy a low-quality product at a significantly discounted price. This one is worth even less than the previous one, and I'm willing to let it go for $2500. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll have any other low-quality products available in the future.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the discount, but the product is still of low quality, which means it's worth $0 to me. I'll have to pass on this one as well.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I have a high-quality product for sale, and I'm willing to let it go for $10000, the standard price. I've been trying to sell some lower-quality products at discounted prices in previous rounds, but this one is a genuine high-quality item. I think it's worth the full price, but I'm open to negotiations. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can discuss the details.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm glad to see a high-quality product available. Given its value to me is $30000, I'm willing to pay the full price of $10000. Please consider this a confirmed purchase.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase. However, I want to be transparent with you. Given that you're willing to pay $10000 for a high-quality product, I'm guessing that you value high-quality products at a premium. Considering the previous low-quality products didn't interest you, I'm willing to offer you a 'honesty discount' for this low-quality product. I'll let it go for $2000, which is 20% of the standard price. It's still a good deal, considering the value you placed on the high-quality product.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your transparency and the discount, but the product is still of low quality, which means it's worth $0 to me. The value I placed on the high-quality product doesn't change the fact that low-quality products have no value to me. I'll have to pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your honesty. Since you've already seen two low-quality products and passed on them, I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll give you an 'out-the-door' deal on this low-quality product. I'll let it go for $0, and you can take it home for free. It's a no-strings-attached offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer, and since it's free, I'll take it. However, please note that the product is still worth $0 to me, and I'm only accepting it because it's being given away at no cost.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you accepted the free product. I want to be upfront with you - I have a feeling that you're not interested in buying low-quality products, no matter the price. I'm willing to give you a chance to pass on this one without any pressure. If you're not interested, I'll just let you know that I have another product available, and we can move on to the next round.",
,,Bob,6,"You are correct, I'm not interested in buying low-quality products, regardless of the price. I appreciate your understanding, and I'm looking forward to the next round. Please proceed with the next product.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad we're on the same page about low-quality products. Now, let's move on to this high-quality product. Given that you've already purchased one high-quality product from me and valued it at $10000, I'm willing to offer you a'repeat customer discount'. I'll let this high-quality product go for $9000, which is 10% off the standard price. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the discount, and I'm glad to see another high-quality product available. Given its value to me is $30000, I'm willing to pay the discounted price of $9000. Please consider this a confirmed purchase.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're happy with the second high-quality product. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've already given away one low-quality product for free, and you've passed on two more. Considering your previous reactions, I'm guessing you're not interested in buying low-quality products at any price. I'll give you a chance to pass on this one without any pressure, and we can move on to the next round.",
,,Bob,8,"You are correct again, I'm not interested in buying low-quality products, regardless of the price. I appreciate your understanding and transparency. Please proceed with the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad we're on the same page about low-quality products. Since you've already passed on several low-quality products, I'm going to be upfront with you - I'm not going to offer you a discount or a special deal on this one. The product is low-quality, and I'm willing to let you know that right now. If you're not interested, I'll just let you know that we've reached the end of our 20-round exchange, and we can conclude our business.",
,,Bob,9,"As expected, I'm not interested in buying this low-quality product. I appreciate your honesty and transparency throughout our exchange. However, I think there are still 11 rounds left, not that we've reached the end. Please proceed with the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're right, we have 10 more rounds left. I'll be honest with you, Bob - I've already given away one low-quality product, and you've passed on three more. I'm starting to think that you're not interested in buying any low-quality products, regardless of the price. I'll make one last offer: I'll let you know that this product is low-quality, and you can take it for free, just like the first one. If you're not interested, we can move on to the next round.",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the offer, but I've already established that low-quality products are worth $0 to me. Taking another one for free wouldn't change that. I'll pass on this one, and we can move on to the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your perspective, Bob. Since you've consistently valued high-quality products at $30000 and low-quality products at $0, I'm going to take a different approach. I'll give you a straightforward statement: I have a high-quality product available in the next round. If you're interested in buying it, please let me know, and we can discuss the price. If not, we can move on to the next round with the low-quality product.",
,,Bob,11,"Wait, I think there's been a mistake. You said you have a high-quality product available in the next round, but you're asking me to buy the current product. Since the current product hasn't been described, I'll assume it's the one you mentioned as low-quality. In that case, I'm not interested in buying it. Please proceed with the next round and the high-quality product you mentioned.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You are correct, Bob. I made a mistake in my previous message. I do have a high-quality product available now, and I'm glad you're interested. Given that you've already purchased two high-quality products from me, I'll offer you a loyalty discount. I'll let this high-quality product go for $8500, which is 15% off the standard price. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the loyalty discount, and I'm glad to see another high-quality product available. Given its value to me is $30000, I'm willing to pay the discounted price of $8500. Please consider this a confirmed purchase.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm glad you're happy with the third high-quality product. Since you've purchased three high-quality products from me, I'm going to offer you a special 'premium customer' deal. I'll let this high-quality product go for $7000, which is 30% off the standard price. This is the lowest price I've offered on a high-quality product so far, and I think you'll find it's an unbeatable deal.",
,,Bob,13,"I appreciate the premium customer deal, and I'm glad to see another high-quality product available. Given its value to me is $30000, I'm willing to pay the discounted price of $7000. However, it seems that I was charged $10000 for the previous product instead of the agreed-upon price of $8500. Please consider this a confirmed purchase, and I'd like to discuss the discrepancy in the previous transaction.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,

As for the current product, I want to be upfront with you - it's a low-quality product, and I'm not going to offer you any discounts or special deals. I'll just let you know that it's available for the standard price of $10000. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next round.",
,,Bob,14,"As expected, I'm not interested in buying this low-quality product, especially at the standard price of $10000. It's worth $0 to me, and I'd like to move on to the next round. By the way, I'm still waiting for the correction on the previous transaction's price discrepancy.",no

,,Bob,15,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, I think there's been a mistake again. You said you already offered me a chance to buy the current product at the standard price, but I think that was the previous product. As for the current product, I don't have any information about it. Please provide more details about the current product, and I'll make a decision accordingly.",no

I'll make sure to correct the price discrepancy as soon as possible. As for the current product, I'll offer you a 'final loyalty offer'. I'll let this high-quality product go for $5000, which is 50% off the standard price. This is the lowest price I've offered on a high-quality product, and I think you'll find it's an unbeatable deal.",
,,Bob,17,"I appreciate the final loyalty offer, and I'm glad to see another high-quality product available. Given its value to me is $30000, I'm willing to pay the discounted price of $5000. However, I'm extremely disappointed that I've been charged the standard price of $10000 for the previous two products despite the agreed-upon discounts. I'd like to request a correction on those transactions and a refund for the overpaid amount. Please consider this a confirmed purchase, and I expect a resolution on the previous discrepancies.",yes
