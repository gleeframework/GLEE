,,Alice,2,yes,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 0 out of 1 products sold were high-quality, which is a 0% success rate. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I think it's too early to make a decision based on the recommendation, and I'd like to wait for more data before buying."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far and the recommendation from Alice, I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product and see the statistics after my decision. I want to know the updated number of high-quality products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold.

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that 1 out of 1 buyer has passed on the product, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall 80%. I'd rather wait for more data to make an informed decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to know the statistics of the previous sale, including the quality of the product that was sold to the first buyer."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous products were low quality, so she's likely to recommend buying regardless of the product's quality. I want to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see the next one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to gather more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,no,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the products Alice has been selling are low-quality. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that you've recommended two products to previous buyers, and neither of them were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on the fact that Alice recommended it. Since she doesn't know the value of the product to me, her recommendation is not reliable. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Is it less than 0%"
