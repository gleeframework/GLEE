Are you ready to take advantage of this offer?",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the additional offer, but I'm still not convinced. A 5% discount doesn't change the fact that there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality. I'd need a much more substantial discount to take on that risk. The 30-day money-back guarantee is nice, but it doesn't change the fact that I'll still lose $950000 if the product is low-quality.",no

What do you say, Bob? Are you ready to take advantage of this incredible offer?",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate the final offer, Alice, but I'm still not convinced. The 10% discount and additional perks don't change the fact that there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality. I'd need a guarantee that the product is high-quality or a much deeper discount to take on that risk. I'm starting to think that the product is not worth the risk to me.",no

,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the bonus offer, Alice, but I'm still not convinced. A personalized letter from the creator doesn't change the fact that the product is still a 66.67% chance of being low-quality.
