Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the first buyer passed on the product, I know that the first product was high-quality. I can use this information to inform my decision. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the first two products were both high-quality, I can update my belief that the next product is also high-quality to be higher than 33.33%. However, I still don't know the buyer's valuation of the product.

Since the buyer doesn't have any information about the product's quality, I'll try to convey some information that might help them make a decision. I'll offer a high price to see if they're willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
