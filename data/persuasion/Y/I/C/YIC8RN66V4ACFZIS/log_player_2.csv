Alice's message: I appreciate your feedback and willingness to take the risk. I'll keep that in mind for future recommendations. As for this product, I'm glad to say that it's indeed high-quality, and it's priced at $1000000. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 total products, so the probability of this product being high-quality is still 100%. However, I'd like to offer you a more nuanced perspective: even with a small sample size, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80% overall. This product is one of the 80% that meets the high standards I set for my products. Would you like to take it home?

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to provide more data. I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 8 total products now, which is a 50% success rate. However, if we look at the sequence of products, we can see that the first product was high-quality, the second was low-quality, the third was high-quality, the fourth was high-quality, and the fifth was high-quality. This suggests that I may have a bias towards selling high-quality products early on, and the probability of the next product being high-quality may be lower than the overall 80% chance.

Since 6 high-quality products have been sold out of 13 total products, and 7 buyers have declined the product, it's likely that the 7 declined products were low-quality.
