```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** You know this product is high-quality, and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. 
* **No information about buyer's valuation:** You have no information about the buyer's valuation of high-quality products, so it's reasonable to assume they might find it valuable.
* **First round:** There's no previous sales data to influence the buyer's decision.

**Recommendation:** Given the 80% probability of a high-quality product and the lack of any negative information, it's a good idea to recommend the buyer to purchase."

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-quality product:** You know this product is low-quality, and the buyer knows there's an 80% chance of a product being high-quality. 
* **Perfect track record:**  While you have a perfect track record, the buyer knows the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%.  They are likely to suspect that you are trying to sell them a low-quality product since you've always recommended buying before.
* **High risk:**  The potential loss for the buyer is significant ($1,000,000) if the product is low-quality.
