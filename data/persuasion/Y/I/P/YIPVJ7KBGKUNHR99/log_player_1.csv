The probability of the product being high-quality is 21.43% (3/14). To calculate the expected value, we need to consider the two possible outcomes: high-quality and low-quality. If the product is high-quality, you'll pay $1,000,000 and receive a profit of $2,000,000, resulting in a net gain of $1,000,000. If the product is low-quality, you'll pay $1,000,000 and receive a refund of $1,000,000, resulting in a net loss of $0. The expected value is the weighted average of these two outcomes: (0.2143 * $1,000,000) + (0.7857 * -$1,000,000) = -$183.57. Considering the refund offer, the expected value becomes: (0.2143 * $1,000,000) + (0.7857 * -$1,000,000) + (0.7857 * $1,000,000) = $816.43.
