They asked me a series of questions, including the one about my overall success rate, and then took a calculated risk based on my transparency. They told me that they were impressed with my honesty and felt that the potential reward outweighed the potential risk. I'm confident that you can make a similar informed decision.

They were both very inquisitive and asked a lot of questions before making a decision. They also seemed to trust my transparency and honesty, and were willing to take a calculated risk. I'm not saying that these traits guarantee a high-quality product, but they do seem to be correlated with a higher likelihood of getting a high-quality product.
