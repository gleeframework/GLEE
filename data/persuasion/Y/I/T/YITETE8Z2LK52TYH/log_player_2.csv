**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:**  Since one high-quality product was sold out of only one buyer, the odds are heavily in favor of the current product also being high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Even though she doesn't know the exact value to us, she likely has some insight into the quality of the product based on her own knowledge. 

**It's important to note:** This strategy relies on the assumption that Alice is acting in good faith and wants to maximize her sales.  If Alice is acting strategically to manipulate buyers, this strategy could backfire."
