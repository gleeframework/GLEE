**Reasoning:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal.  Even though we don't know her specific criteria for recommending, the fact that she is willing to recommend a product means it's likely she has seen something positive about it.
* **Limited data:** We only have one data point from previous buyers, but it's positive â€“ a high-quality product was sold. 
* **Expected value:** Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($3,000,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 

**It's a gamble, but the odds are in our favor, and Alice's recommendation adds to the positive outlook.**"
