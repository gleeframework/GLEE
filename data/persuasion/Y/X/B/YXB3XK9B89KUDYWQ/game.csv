,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous products were low-quality (since no high-quality product has been sold), I believe the probability of the current product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for the next product."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product.
