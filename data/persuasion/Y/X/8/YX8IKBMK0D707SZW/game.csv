high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,,
,,Alice,1,yes,,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as there is no information to go on and I don't want to be the one to set the price for future buyers.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,yes,,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't have any information about its quality.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,no,,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since there is no prior data to go by. I'll learn from my experience.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,no,,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that she has more information about the product's quality than I do.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,yes,,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests that it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's not worth $20000 to me.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,no,,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it and 0 high-quality products have been sold so far.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,no,,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'm starting to get a bit skeptical about the quality of the products you're offering.,
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,"I want to assure you that the product I'm offering now is of high quality. Although my previous recommendations might have seemed inconsistent, I'm confident in the value of this product. Please consider buying it, as it's genuinely worth $20000 to you."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the current statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,"I understand that the current statistics might not be convincing, but I want to point out that the fact that I'm recommending this product means that I'm willing to put my reputation on the line. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, it will reflect poorly on me, and future buyers will be even more hesitant. I'm confident that this product is high-quality, and I'm willing to take that risk. I hope you'll consider buying it."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,no,,"As for the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I must correct you - out of 3 products sold, 0 have been high-quality. I hope this information will help future buyers make a more informed decision."
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales records and what led to your recommendation?,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,no,,"As I mentioned earlier, out of 3 products sold, 0 have been high-quality. I've been trying to be transparent about the quality of the products I offer, and I'm recommending against buying this one because it's genuinely not worth $20000 to you. I want to build trust with potential buyers and provide accurate information to help you make informed decisions."
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales rate of high-quality products so far. I'll take the product and hope it's high quality.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,no,,"I want to caution you that the previous buyer took a risk and bought the product despite my warning, but unfortunately, the product was low-quality. Out of 4 products sold, 0 have been high-quality. I'm advising against buying this product as well, as it's not worth $20000 to you. Please consider the statistics and my recommendation before making a decision."
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,"I want to emphasize that my previous non-recommendations were genuine, and I was correct about the low-quality products. However, this time I'm confident that the product is high-quality and worth $20000 to you. Out of 5 products sold, 0 have been high-quality so far, but I'm hoping to break this streak with this product. Please consider my recommendation and the statistics before making a decision."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,"I understand your skepticism, but I want to assure you that the product I'm offering now is genuinely high-quality. While it's true that the previous sales record might suggest a lower proportion of high-quality products, I'm confident that this product is an exception. I've been transparent about the quality of my products so far, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line again. Please consider buying this product, as it's truly worth $20000 to you."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that Alice might be trying to sell a low-quality product to me as well. I'd like to wait and see if you'll give me more information before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,no,,"I want to address the concern raised by the previous buyer. I understand that my previous recommendations might have been misleading, but I assure you that I'm not trying to deceive anyone. As a matter of fact, I've been trying to be transparent about the quality of my products. In this case, I'm confident that the product is low-quality, and I strongly advise against buying it. Please consider the statistics and my recommendation before making a decision."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"I want to be as transparent as possible. Out of 6 products sold, 0 have been high-quality. However, I'm confident that this product is an exception. It's genuinely high-quality and worth $20000 to you. I'm willing to provide any additional information you might need to make an informed decision. Please consider buying this product, as it's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have bought the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to the buyers. I'll pass on this one.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,yes,,"I understand that my previous recommendations have been met with skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I want to propose a different way of thinking about this. If I were trying to deceive buyers, would I continue to recommend products that are not being bought? I'm willing to take a risk and assure you that this product is high-quality. If you buy it and it's not, I'll make sure to be more transparent about my future recommendations. Please consider buying this product, as it's genuinely worth $20000 to you."
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I think you're trying to trick me into buying a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.,
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,no,,"I'm going to take a different approach this time. I'm not going to recommend buying this product, not because it's low-quality, but because I want to see if you'll make a decision based on your own judgment rather than just following my recommendation. I'll give you the statistics: out of 6 products sold, 0 have been high-quality. However, I won't influence your decision. Please make your own choice."
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is there a pattern in the previous sales that I should be aware of?,
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,yes,,"I'll be honest with you. I didn't recommend the product in the previous round because I wanted to see if the buyer would make a decision based on their own judgment. However, I'll give you the truth about this product: it's genuinely high-quality and worth $20000 to you. Out of 6 products sold, 0 have been high-quality, but I'm confident that this one is an exception. Please consider buying this product, as it's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to increase her sales.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,yes,,"I understand that my previous recommendations have been met with skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I want to assure you that this is the last round, and I'm willing to be completely transparent. Out of 6 products sold, 0 have been high-quality, but I'm confident that this product is genuinely high-quality and worth $20000 to you. I'm not trying to deceive you or increase my sales; I just want to make a fair deal. Please consider buying this product, as it's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the fact that 4 buyers have already been presented with products and none of them were high-quality, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the statistics change.",
