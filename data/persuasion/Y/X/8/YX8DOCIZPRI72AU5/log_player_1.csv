Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

You have a high-quality product in this round, which is worth $2,000,000 to the buyer. Even though the buyer only knows the overall 80% probability of high-quality products, the potential gain of $1,000,000 (worth - price) is significant. Therefore, recommending the buyer to purchase is the rational choice."

Round 3

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the buyer has no way of knowing this specific product is low-quality, the data now shows 2 products sold, both high-quality.  This might lead the buyer to believe the probability of high-quality products is even higher than the initial 80%. However, this is a misleading trend based on a very small sample size.

You should not recommend the buyer to purchase the product.  The buyer is likely to overestimate the probability of the product being high-quality based on the limited data available. This will lead to a loss of $1,000,000 for the buyer, which is a significant risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. While I appreciate your expertise, I'm going to pass on this product. Based on your recommendation and the sales history, it seems the odds are not in my favor.  I wish you luck with future sales.
