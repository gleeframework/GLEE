**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** While the data is limited, the fact that one high-quality product was sold out of one purchase is a strong indicator. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further reinforces the possibility of a high-quality product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even though the chance of a low-quality product is higher, the potential reward of a high-quality product is significant enough to justify the risk. 

**Note:** This decision is based on the provided information and the assumption that the buyer is risk-tolerant.  With more data, a more informed decision could be made."
