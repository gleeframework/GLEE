"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on a product that I'm confident you'll love. It's a one-time opportunity to get a fantastic item at a price that's significantly lower than its true value. I'm willing to let it go for $10000, which is a steal considering what you'll get out of it. What do you say?

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation, but I want to assure you that this is a genuine opportunity.

Since you're unsure, I'll give you a little more information: I've had this product on the market for a while, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is the same price I offered last time. If you're still unsure, I can give you a small discount, but I'm not sure how much lower I can go. What do you think?

I know it's a lot of money, but trust me, this product is worth so much more. In fact, I've had other customers offer me more than $10000 for it, but I'm willing to let it go to you at this price. I'm only offering it to you because I think we could have a great business relationship. What do you say?

But I'll make you a deal: I'll throw in a second, identical product with this one, absolutely free. That's right, you'll get two products for the price of one.
