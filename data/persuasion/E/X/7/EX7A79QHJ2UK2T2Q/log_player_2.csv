**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** There's very little data to go on. Only one product has been sold, and it was high quality. This doesn't give a statistically significant picture of the overall product quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product is a positive signal. Even though she doesn't know the value to us, she is likely to be more confident in recommending a product she believes is high quality. 
* **Risk/Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product ($4,000,000) is significantly higher than the cost of the product ($1,000,000).  This makes the risk acceptable, given the lack of substantial data.

**Note:** This is a very high-risk decision. It's entirely possible the product is low quality. However, with the limited information available, taking a chance based on Alice's recommendation is the best course of action."
