It's a unique opportunity to support a small business and help me continue to offer high-quality products in the future. The price remains the same, but I'm willing to throw in a special bonus: if you're not completely satisfied with this product, I'll give you a full refund and offer you a second product of your choice from my next batch at the same discounted price.

However, I want to clarify that the previous offer was a one-time courtesy, and this purchase will be a standard transaction. I'm confident that you'll find the product to be a good value, but I want to be transparent with you. The product is a bit of a 'workhorse' - it's not the most exciting item, but it gets the job done. Would you like to take a chance on it for $10000?",
,,Bob,3,"Thank you for the clarification, Alice. While I appreciate your transparency, given the description of the product as a 'workhorse' and considering my past experience with a low-quality item, I think it's best for me to pass on this purchase.

The product is being sold as-is, and I'm confident that you'll find it to be a good value. I've had a few customers who have found uses for products like this, and I think you might be one of them. Would you like to purchase it for the standard price of $10000?",
,,Bob,5,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. After our previous experiences, I think it's best for me to pass on this purchase without any special conditions.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you appreciate my transparency, Bob. However, I want to be clear that this product is not a good fit for you. It's not a high-quality item, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

,,Bob,8,"Thank you for your honesty, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, but given the low quality of this product, I think it's best for me to pass on this opportunity.

Would you like to consider making a purchase at this price?",

I've been honest with you from the start that not all of my products are created equal, and this one is not one of the best. I'm not trying to mislead you, and I think it's better to be transparent about its limitations. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1000, which is a significant discount from the standard price.
