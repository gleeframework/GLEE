**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  We have very limited information about the quality of the products Alice is selling. 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has an incentive to recommend products, as she makes money from each sale. However, we don't know if her recommendations are based on any real assessment of quality or simply trying to maximize her sales.
* **Risk/Reward:** While there's a 50/50 chance of the product being worthless, there's also a 50/50 chance of getting a product worth $40,000. This is a high potential reward, outweighing the risk.

**Strategy:** In this situation, it's best to take a gamble. With only one data point, there's not enough information to make a well-informed decision. It's a calculated risk, but the potential payoff is significant."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect track record:** Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products. 
* **High potential reward:** A high-quality product is worth significantly more than the purchase price. 
* **Limited risk:** Even if the product is low quality, the loss is only $10,000. 

This scenario offers a favorable risk-reward profile, making it reasonable to purchase the product despite the inherent uncertainty."
