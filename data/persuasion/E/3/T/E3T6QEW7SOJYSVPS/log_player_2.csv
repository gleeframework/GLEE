**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information about the product's quality. We only know that one high-quality product was sold out of a small sample size. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation is valuable, as she has more information than us about the product's quality.  While her recommendation doesn't guarantee a high-quality product, it's a positive signal.
* **Potential Reward:**  Even if the product is low quality, we lose nothing. However, if it's high quality, we make a significant profit ($3,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $2,000,000). 

Given the potential upside and limited downside, it's reasonable to take a chance and buy the product."
