,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but since you've recommended not to buy it, I'll pass. I'm also concerned that 5 out of 5 products sold were low quality, which is a strong indication that the remaining products are also likely to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy the product and have ended up with low-quality ones. I'd like to wait for a different product that might have a higher chance of being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is to not buy it, which suggests that the product might be low-quality. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of 0 high-quality products sold."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that the previous 6 buyers all bought the products despite your recommendations, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality may be lower than 33.33%, or that your recommendations are biased. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

This makes me skeptical of the recommendation."
