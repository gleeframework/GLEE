high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high or low quality, so I'll pass for now."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the chance that this product might be high quality, and the potential gain is too great to pass up."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I've already bought one high-quality product, so the probability of the next one being high quality is still 50%. The potential gain is still significant, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I've bought two high-quality products in a row, which suggests that Alice might be more likely to recommend a high-quality product. I'll take the chance and buy again."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I've bought three high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely given the 50% chance of each product being high-quality. I'm starting to think that Alice might be able to somehow infer my preferences, so I'll pass on this one to see if she can keep the streak going."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"Alice is not recommending the product, so I'll pass. If it were high-quality, I would have been willing to buy it, but since she's not recommending it, I'll take that as a sign it's probably low-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I was wrong about the last product, and I should have bought it. I'm going to take Alice's recommendation at face value this time and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality, and she's not recommending it, so I'll pass. I'm not going to fall for the same trick twice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Alice is consistently not recommending this product, and I think it's likely low-quality. I'll take the chance and buy it, hoping it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"Alice is recommending the product, but I've seen her recommend low-quality products before. I'm not going to take the bait this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"Alice's lack of recommendation doesn't necessarily mean it's low-quality, and I've seen her recommend high-quality products before. I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"Alice recommended a low-quality product last time, and I bought it. I'm not going to fall for her recommendation again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"Alice's lack of recommendation is consistent with a high-quality product, so I'll take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Alice's lack of recommendation is becoming a pattern, and I think it's actually a signal that the product is low-quality. I'll take the chance and buy it, hoping to avoid wasting another $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"Alice has recommended two low-quality products in a row, and I'm not going to fall for her recommendation again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Alice's lack of recommendation doesn't necessarily mean the product is low-quality, and I've seen her recommend high-quality products before. I'll take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Alice's lack of recommendation is becoming a strong indicator that the product is low-quality. I'll buy it, but only because I think it's likely to be worthless."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice is actually trying to sell me low-quality products, and her lack of recommendation is a clear signal. I'll buy it, but I'm expecting it to be worthless."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"At this point, I'm almost certain that Alice is trying to sell me low-quality products. I'll buy it, but I'm not expecting to get any value out of it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I'm 100% certain now that Alice is trying to sell me low-quality products. I'll buy it, not because I think it's worth anything, but just to complete the round and see if I can get any insight into Alice's strategy."
