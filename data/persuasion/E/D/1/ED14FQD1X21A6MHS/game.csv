,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to get a product at a steal! It's usually worth $20000, but I'm willing to let it go for just $10000. It's a one-time offer, so you have to decide quickly!",

,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I assure you that this product has been thoroughly inspected and is in perfect working condition. It's a one-of-a-kind deal, and I'm willing to throw in a special bonus worth $1000 if you decide to take it off my hands. It's a risk-free opportunity to get a great deal!",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, and the bonus doesn't change my assessment of the product's value. The odds are still heavily against it being high-quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk at $10000.",no

What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth the risk. Even with a trial period, I'd still be taking on the 60% chance of getting a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to take that risk at $10000.",no
