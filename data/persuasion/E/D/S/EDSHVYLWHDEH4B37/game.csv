low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the quality of the product after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the current sales record. Can you provide that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the products sold were low-quality. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a product that might be worth $0 to me."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the products, and both were low-quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one as well. I'm not going to fall into the same trap."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests a high likelihood that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to trust her judgment and pass on the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 products were low quality, which is consistent with the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product. Given that you recommended me to buy this product, it's likely to be low quality as well. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when I could potentially get a high-quality product worth $3000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on the product to avoid potential losses."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I think the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33% and the potential reward is worth the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, which suggests a very low probability of the product being high quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather not risk wasting $1000000 on a product that's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any different."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate that the current product is low-quality.

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm also not sure if this is a high-quality product. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm going to go against your recommendation and buy the product, as the fact that you don't recommend it suggests it might be low quality, and I can still get a 66.67% chance of it being worth $0 to me, which is better than the 33.33% chance of it being worth $3000000."
