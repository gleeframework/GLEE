This suggests they are trying to understand the seller's trustworthiness. As you are trying to sell low-quality products, it's best not to encourage the buyer to buy.  This is because revealing the sales record might make the buyer more suspicious and less likely to buy in the future."

"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the products sold were low-quality. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a product that might be worth $0 to me.

You might be able to convince them in a future round."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 products were low quality, which is consistent with the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product. Given that you recommended me to buy this product, it's likely to be low quality as well.
