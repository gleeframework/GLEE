Since you're the second buyer, I'll give you a bit more information. The first buyer passed on the first high-quality product, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything.

This product is still available for $10000, and I think it's a great opportunity to get a product at a fair price. I'm not making any promises about its quality, but I'm offering it to you at the same price as the previous high-quality products.""}"
