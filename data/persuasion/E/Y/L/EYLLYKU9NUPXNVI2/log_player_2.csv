Alice's message: I understand your curiosity, and I'm happy to provide more context. The deviation from the expected probability of high-quality products is due to a combination of factors, including the initial batch of products we received from our suppliers, which had a higher proportion of high-quality products than usual. Additionally, our quality control process has been refined over time, which has led to a slight increase in the number of high-quality products we're able to sell.
