,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already passed on the products, I'm inclined to think that the products might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth only $0 to me."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 only to find out it's worth $0 to me."
