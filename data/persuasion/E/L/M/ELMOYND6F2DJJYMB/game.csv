,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous sales record shows 0 high-quality products sold out of the products offered to the previous buyers, which suggests a high probability that the product I'm offered is of low quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the previous 2 buyers also passed on the products, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that none of the previous two products were high-quality, and the probability of the product being low-quality is still high"

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you didn't recommend it. This implies that the product is likely to be low-quality, so I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $100, which is better than passing on it and letting it be discarded."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality based on the statistics, and your recommendation doesn't give me much confidence. I'd rather pass on this one."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, so I'm inclined to pass on this one. I'd like to know why Alice thinks this product is high-quality when the previous three were not."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather wait for more information or a different recommendation."
