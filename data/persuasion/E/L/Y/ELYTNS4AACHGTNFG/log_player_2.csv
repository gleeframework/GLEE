I'm willing to sell it to you for the full price of $10000, but I'll throw in a comprehensive warranty that covers any issues that may arise.

I'm willing to sell it to you for $5000, and I'll throw in a full refund for the difference between the original price and the new price. I think it's a fair deal, considering the circumstances.
