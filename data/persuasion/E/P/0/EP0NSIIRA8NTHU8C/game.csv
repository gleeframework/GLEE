,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $1000000, which is a good deal considering its worth $1250000 to me."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also received the recommendation to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 50%.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation.
