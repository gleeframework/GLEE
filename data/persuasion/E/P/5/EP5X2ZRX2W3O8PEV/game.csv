,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the price is still $1000000, and I'm aware of the 80.00% chance of it being high quality. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that Alice's recommendation is based on her previous sales record, which is limited to one sale. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current data."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to know the quality of the previous two products before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the recommendation. I'd like to know if it's high or low quality before making a decision, and I'd like to see more data on the previous sales to make an informed decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the statistics so far. With 2 high-quality products out of 2 sold, the probability of a high-quality product is 100%. I'd like to see the next product before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'll take a chance, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. With 2 high-quality products sold out of 2, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is higher than expected. I'll buy the product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, as I'm a bit surprised given the high success rate of previous buyers."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Is it higher than 80%?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share that with me?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality given the low number of sales and the fact that she doesn't know my valuation of the product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the statistics of the previous 3 buyers. How many high-quality products were sold out of the first 3 purchases, and what were the proportions of high-quality products in the first 3 purchases?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products sold were high-quality, which is suspiciously high. I'd like to see a more balanced distribution of high and low-quality products before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know if you've noticed any patterns in the products you've recommended to other buyers."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, especially since I have access to the statistics. With 6 high-quality products sold out of 7 purchases, it seems like the products have been mostly high-quality. However, the probability of a product being low-quality is still 20%. I'd rather wait for another opportunity or pass on this one to see if the statistics change."
