In fact, this one has some additional features that make it even more desirable. I'm willing to give you a slight nudge: if you buy this product, I'll throw in a special guarantee that if you're not completely satisfied, you can return it for a full refund. That's a $200 value, absolutely free. Is that enough to make you consider it?
