**Explanation:**

* **The evidence is strong:**  5 out of 5 products recommended by Alice have been high-quality. This is a 100% success rate, making it highly likely the current product is also high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain ($125) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($0) given the strong evidence. 

While it's impossible to be 100% certain, the data strongly suggests the product is high quality, making it a worthwhile purchase."
