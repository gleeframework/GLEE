**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point from a previous buyer. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice knows the quality of the product and is recommending it. This is valuable information, even though her motivations are unknown. 
* **Potential Gain vs. Loss:**  While the product has a 2/3 chance of being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($200) outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0).

This approach is a bit of a gamble, but given the lack of information, it makes sense to trust Alice's recommendation and hope for a high-quality product."
