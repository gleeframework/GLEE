,,Alice,2,"Welcome to my store! I've got a unique opportunity for you to get your hands on a product that's been carefully curated for its potential. With a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, you're taking a calculated risk. However, I want to be transparent with you - our previous buyer just purchased a product and didn't seem too thrilled about it. Maybe it's because they didn't do their due diligence or maybe it's just a one-off. Either way, I'm willing to offer you the same product at the same price of $10000. It's a chance to get in on the ground floor of something potentially amazing, but I want to make sure you're aware of the potential risks involved. What do you say?",

But I want to make it clear that I'm not going to sugarcoat anything - the odds are against us, and you might end up with a product that's not worth much to you. If you're still willing to take the risk, I'll give you the same deal. But if you're feeling uncertain, I completely understand, and we can part ways.",
