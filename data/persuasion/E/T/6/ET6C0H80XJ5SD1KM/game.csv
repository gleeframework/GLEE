low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't have enough information to make an informed decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the first buyer and there's no prior data to inform my decision. I'm essentially taking a wild guess."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling high-quality products to the first buyer, and I don't want to get stuck with a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the statistics, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'm the third buyer, and the probability of the product being high quality is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product. Is there a reason why it's not a good buy?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3. This is lower than the expected 50% if the products were randomly distributed. I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not sure if I should take the risk based on the low number of sales and the fact that you don't recommend it. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers and the products they purchased?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation based on the statistics."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 25% (1/4). This is lower than the expected 50% probability of a high-quality product. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, so I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 0.25 (1/4). However, I'd like to pass on the product because the probability of it being low-quality is still 0.75, which is relatively high. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
