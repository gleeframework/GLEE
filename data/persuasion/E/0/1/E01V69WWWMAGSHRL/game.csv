,,Alice,4,no,

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers didn't buy the product, and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have not found a high-quality product, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than 33.33%. I will pass on the product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
