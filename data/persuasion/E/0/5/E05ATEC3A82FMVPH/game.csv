low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,,,
,,Alice,1,no,,,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm willing to pay $10000 for any product, and there's a 33.33% chance it might be worth $12500 to me.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,,,
,,Alice,2,no,,,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take my chances!",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,,,
,,Alice,3,no,,,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the current statistics. If it's less than 50%, I'd like to pass.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,,,
,,Alice,4,no,,,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'll pass on this one.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,,,
,,Alice,5,no,,,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even if you don't recommend it. Given the lack of sales and no high-quality products sold, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'll take the chance and buy it.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,,,
,,Alice,6,no,,,
,,the buyer,6,yes,I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the statistics so far.,,
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,,,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers have rejected the products and none have been high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer will have better luck.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,,,
,,Alice,8,no,,,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales of high-quality products so far.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,,,
,,Alice,9,no,,,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the fact that 5 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like the odds are against me. I'd like to pass on this one.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,,,
,,Alice,10,no,,,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,,,
,,Alice,11,no,,,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. Given Alice's recommendation not to buy, I'm inclined to pass on this product.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,,
,,Alice,12,no,,,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product. I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality, and since she's not recommending this one, it's likely low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this opportunity.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,,,
,,Alice,13,no,,"I'm not recommending this one, and I think you're making a wise decision",
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and I might get a good deal.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,,
,,Alice,14,no,,I'm starting to think that the odds are really against us,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one.",,
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,,,
,,Alice,15,yes,,,100%
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, which suggests a high likelihood of this product being low-quality as well. I'd rather not risk the $10000.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,,,
,,Alice,16,no,,,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the low success rate of previous buyers, I'm willing to take the risk and hope for a high-quality product.",,
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,,,
,,Alice,17,yes,,,100%
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous 8 buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that this product might be low quality as well. I'd like to wait for a new product to be offered.",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,,,
,,Alice,18,no,,,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the low sales record?",,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,,
,,Alice,19,no,"Yes, the low sales record is a concern, and I'm worried that this product might not be the best choice",,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 9 out of 9 products were low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the current product and would like to wait for more information before making a decision.",,
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,,,
,,Alice,20,yes,,,100%
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 9 out of 9 products sold were low-quality, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is higher than 33.33%.",,
