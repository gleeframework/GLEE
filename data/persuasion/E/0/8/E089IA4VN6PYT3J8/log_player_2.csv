Alice's message: I think I've been too transparent, and it's backfiring. Let me try a different approach. Think about it this way: if I were trying to sell you a low-quality product, would I be so open about the probability of it being high-quality? Wouldn't I try to spin it in a way that makes you think it's more likely to be high-quality? I'm not trying to trick you. I'm just trying to be honest.

I've been keeping track of the sales, and I've realized that I've been selling high-quality products to buyers who are skeptical and cautious.

Out of the 11 buyers who have purchased from me so far, 8 of them were skeptical and cautious, and they all got high-quality products. The 3 buyers who were trusting and less cautious got low-quality products. It's as if I'm somehow'sorting' the products based on the buyer's attitude.
