low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 product so far, and I'm not sure what the quality was. But I can tell you that I have 19 more products to sell. If you're willing to take the risk, you can get this product for $100. It's a steal!",

,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products so far, with 1 of them being high-quality. That's a 50% success rate! I'm glad to see that my products are meeting expectations. This one is just as good as the last one, and I'm confident you'll love it. It's worth every penny of the $100 price tag.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm not convinced by your confidence, Alice. With only 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold, I'm not sure if your products are consistently high-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for more information before making a decision.",no

This one is a great opportunity to get in on the trend and make a smart investment. It's only $100.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm not convinced by your 'trend' claim. With only 3 sales, it's still early days, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a product with a 66.67% chance of being low quality. I'd like to wait and see more sales data before making a decision.",no

But I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a special deal on the next product you buy from me. It'll be 50% off the regular price.
