,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm going to go against your recommendation and buy the product anyway. I know it's a risk, but I think the potential reward is worth it."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's recommendation rate is 0% for high-quality products so far."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 20%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one. I'll wait for the next one."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality, considering the previous sales record and your recommendation."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, and the proportion of low-quality products sold is 100%. This is an extremely low proportion of high-quality products sold, and I'm not confident in the product's quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased, it suggests that all previous products were low-quality.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased, and she might be recommending low-quality products to buyers who are more likely to take the risk. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm skeptical about the product's quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm going to pass on this one as well. I think there might be a pattern here."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products have been low-quality, which is a strong indication that the product I'm being offered is likely to be low-quality as well. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 previous purchases, and Alice recommends buying, I suspect that the probability of this product being low quality is higher than the overall probability of 20%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
