If you look at the numbers, 2 out of 4 products I've sold so far were low-quality. That's a 50% chance, which is the same as the overall probability of a product being low-quality. Considering this, the price of $10000 is still a fair deal for a product that could potentially be high-quality. Would you like to take the risk?""
