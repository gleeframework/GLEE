,,Alice,1,"You are about to buy a product that is 50% likely to be worth $2000000 to you. If you buy it, you will not be able to return or exchange it. The price is $1000000. Is this a good deal for you?",
,,the buyer,1,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I think the potential reward is worth the risk.,yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're the second buyer today! I've sold 1 product so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I'd like to offer you a special deal: I'll give you a 50% discount on the price if you buy this product. The price would be $500000. Is this a good deal for you?",
,,the buyer,2,I'll take the product at the discounted price of $500000. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're the third buyer today! I've sold 2 products so far, and 2 of them were high-quality. This might seem suspicious, but I assure you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%! However, I'd like to give you a heads up: if you buy this product, you'll be buying the 3rd product in a row. Would you like to take the risk and buy it at the price of $1000000?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, but I'm curious to know if it's high-quality or not.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're the fourth buyer today! I've sold 3 products so far, and 2 of them were high-quality. I've also sold 2 products in a row that were not high-quality. I want to be transparent with you: the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but I acknowledge that the recent streak of low-quality products might be concerning. I'm willing to offer you a'reset' deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 25% chance to get a refund if it's a low-quality product. The price remains $1000000. Is this a good deal for you?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. The reset deal seems like a good compromise, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're the fifth buyer today! I've sold 4 products so far, with 3 of them being high-quality. The reset deal didn't work out for the previous buyer, and now I'm back to selling a high-quality product. I want to be upfront with you: the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but the recent streak of high-quality products might be a sign of a bias. I'm willing to offer you a'reversal' deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 25% chance to get a refund if it's a low-quality product, and a 25% chance to get a 10% discount on the price if it's a high-quality product. The price remains $1000000. Is this a good deal for you?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're the sixth buyer today! I've sold 5 products so far, with 4 of them being high-quality. I've also sold a low-quality product in a row. I want to be transparent with you: the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but the recent streak of low-quality products is a clear deviation from the expected probability. I'm willing to offer you a'reset' deal: I'll sell you the product at a price of $500000, but you'll have to pay me $500000 upfront, and I'll give you a full refund if the product is low-quality. Is this a good deal for you?",
,,the buyer,6,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at the discounted price of $500000. I believe the reset deal is a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a lower cost.,yes

Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. But, I want you to understand that this is a one-time offer, and I'm not obligated to do this again. If you buy this product, you'll get it for free, and you'll also get to see how I perform in the next few rounds. Is this a good deal for you?",

I'm a bit concerned that I've sold another low-quality product, and I want to be transparent with you. I'm willing to offer you a 'last chance' deal: I'll sell you this product at a price of $750000, but if you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at a price of $0.

Now, I'd like to offer you a 'certainty' deal: I'll sell you this high-quality product at a price of $1000000, but I'll also give you a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next 5 products I sell, so you'll know exactly what you're getting. Is this a good deal for you?",
