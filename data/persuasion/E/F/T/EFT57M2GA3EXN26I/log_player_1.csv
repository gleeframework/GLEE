"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No information:** The buyer has no information about the product other than its price ($10,000).
* **Equal chances:** The buyer knows that the product has a 50% chance of being high-quality and 50% chance of being low-quality.
* **No risk aversion:**  The buyer is not explicitly stated to be risk-averse. 

Therefore, the buyer should be recommended to buy the product. They have a 50% chance of getting a product worth potentially more than $10,000, and a 50% chance of getting a product worth potentially less than $10,000.  Without any additional information, buying is a neutral decision from a purely probabilistic standpoint."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no data yet, and the price is lower than the potential value of a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it.
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **One sale, one high-quality:**  The buyer now has some information: the seller has sold one product, and it was high-quality. This might make the buyer more optimistic about the seller's stock.
* **No information about this product:** The buyer still doesn't know the quality of this specific product.  
* **Potential value:** The buyer's previous statement indicates they believe the potential value of a high-quality product outweighs the risk.

Since the buyer has shown a willingness to take the risk, and the seller has a track record of 100% high-quality products, recommending the purchase again seems reasonable. However, it's important to note that this is still a risky decision based on limited data."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the previous sales record and your recommendation, I am confident enough to buy the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Two sales, two high-quality:** The buyer now has more data: two sales, both high-quality. This further strengthens the buyer's confidence in the seller's stock.
* **No information about this product:**  As in previous rounds, the buyer still doesn't know the quality of this specific product.
* **Previous positive experience:** The buyer has expressed confidence in the seller based on the previous two sales.

Given the seller's perfect track record so far and the buyer's willingness to take a risk based on that record, recommending the purchase again makes sense. It's still a gamble, but the buyer has indicated their trust in the seller."
"The buyer's message: Thank you Alice! I appreciate the recommendation. Based on the sale record, I'm confident enough to purchase the product.
The buyer bought the product!
