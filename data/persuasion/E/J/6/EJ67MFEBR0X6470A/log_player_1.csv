"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality, the buyer knows it's worth $30,000 to them. Even though they only have to pay $10,000, there's a significant profit potential.  

This is the first round, so the buyer has no information on your selling record to go by. They only know the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. 

Despite the risk, the potential reward is worth it for the buyer."

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This round's product is low-quality, meaning it's worth $0 to the buyer.  The buyer is aware of the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, but now they also know that you sold one high-quality product in the previous round. 

This means the buyer can calculate that there's a 66.67% chance of this product being low-quality.  There is no chance of profit for them, so it's not a good purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that only one high-quality product has been sold so far, I prefer to pass on this opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer knows the product is high quality, and therefore worth $30,000 to them. This means a profit of $20,000.  While the buyer knows that only one high-quality product has been sold previously, they are still aware of the inherent probability of a high-quality product being 33.33%. This means the buyer is still more likely to lose money if they don't buy the product than if they do. It's still a good deal for the buyer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I trust your assessment and will purchase the product.
The buyer bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** This round's product is high-quality, worth $30,000 to the buyer.
* **Profit Potential:** The buyer can profit $20,000 by purchasing at $10,000.
* **Buyer's Knowledge:** The buyer knows the product is high quality and has seen two high-quality products sold so far. This increases their confidence in the likelihood of future products being high quality.

While the buyer is aware of the inherent 33.33% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward significantly outweighs the risk.  The buyer is likely to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and your previous feedback, I believe this is a good opportunity to purchase a potentially high-quality product.
The buyer bought the product!

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** This round's product is low-quality, meaning it's worth $0 to the buyer.
* **Buyer's Knowledge:** The buyer has seen three high-quality products sold and only one low-quality product so far. This significantly changes the buyer's perception of the probability of a product being high-quality.  Even though the inherent probability remains at 33.33%, the buyer is likely to believe the actual probability is much higher, given the recent history of high-quality products. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There is no chance of profit for the buyer in this round, and the buyer is more likely to assume they will be buying a low-quality product. 

The risk is high, and the potential reward is zero. It's not a good purchase for the buyer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend this product, I choose to pass on it.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** The product is low-quality and worth $0 to the buyer.
* **Buyer's Knowledge:** The buyer now knows that there have been 3 high-quality products sold and 2 low-quality products. While the inherent probability remains at 33.33%, the buyer is likely to believe the actual probability of a high-quality product is much higher.
* **No Profit Potential:** There is no chance of profit for the buyer, and the buyer is likely to assume they will be buying a low-quality product given the recent history. 

It's a risky purchase for the buyer with no potential for profit. They are likely to pass."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend me to buy this product, I will pass on this opportunity.

* **Buyer's Knowledge:** The buyer has seen 3 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products sold so far.

* **No Profit Potential:** There's no chance of profit for the buyer, and the risk of purchasing a low-quality product is higher now due to the recent history of sales.

It's not a good purchase for the buyer as there's no potential for profit and the risk of losing money is high.  The buyer is likely to pass."

* **Buyer's Knowledge:** The buyer has seen 3 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products sold so far. The buyer is likely to be even more cautious now, as the number of low-quality products has surpassed the high-quality ones.

* **No Profit Potential:** There's no chance of profit for the buyer, and the risk of purchasing a low-quality product is high.

* **No Profit Potential:**  There is no chance of profit for the buyer, and the risk of buying a low-quality product is extremely high.

* **Profit Potential:**  The buyer can profit $20,000 by purchasing at $10,000. 
* **Buyer's Knowledge:** While the buyer has seen a history of mostly low-quality products (3 high-quality, 7 low-quality), they are still aware of the inherent probability of a high-quality product being 33.33%. This means there's still a chance, even if it's a smaller one now.
