"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $4,000,000 to you if it's high quality and only $0 if it's low quality, and Alice knows this, it's in her best interest to recommend the high-quality products.  Even though there's a 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential gain from the high-quality product outweighs the risk. It's a gamble worth taking."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has recommended high-quality products in the previous two rounds, leading to a significant profit for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has successfully recommended four high-quality products in a row. This reinforces the belief that she's genuinely trying to help you and that her recommendations are reliable.

```

**Reasoning:**

Two low-quality products in a row is starting to raise doubts about Alice's ability to accurately predict the quality of products. However, it's essential to remember that random chance plays a significant role in this game.
