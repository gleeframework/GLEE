Don't miss out on this opportunity to get a great product before my sales history catches up with reality!",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your optimism, Alice, but your sales history still doesn't provide enough confidence for me to make a purchase.

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I see what's going on here... My sales history is still a major hurdle, and I don't blame you for being cautious. But let me ask you, don't you think it's time for the tide to turn?
