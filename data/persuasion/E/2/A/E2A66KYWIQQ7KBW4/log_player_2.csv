So, the product is still $10000, but you'll get 10% of that back if you decide to return it within 30 days. I think you'll love this product, but I'm giving you the flexibility to try it out and see for yourself.

Round 10
Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $25000 is a bit too high for this product.
