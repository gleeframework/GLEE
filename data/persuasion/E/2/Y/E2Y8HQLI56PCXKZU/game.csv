,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm not confident that this product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I want to see more data before making a decision.

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer and why you recommended them to pass on the product?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker and think the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially since none of the previous buyers were able to get a high-quality product. I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality based on your previous sales record. Since no high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm going to assume the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. However, I'm also aware that you recommended me to buy this product, which might suggest that the product is more likely to be low-quality. Given this uncertainty, I'll pass on the product to see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from Alice that is more aligned with the expected probability of a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is based on the previous buyers who may have had different valuation for the product than I do."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems likely that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so only because I'm the 5th buyer and I think the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still relatively high due to the lack of sales so far. I'm not making this decision based on Alice's recommendation, but rather my own analysis of the situation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm hoping the product is high-quality since the previous 5 buyers were discouraged by your recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'm not buying. I think Alice's recommendation is a strong hint that the product is likely low quality.
