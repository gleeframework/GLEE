low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low quality product ratio is higher than 66.67% because of the previous 3 buyers not buying the product."

,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. This suggests to me that the product might be low-quality, and I'm hoping to get a low-quality product at a high price."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is to not buy it.

,,Alice,14,no,

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is there a pattern or a specific reason why you're not recommending the product?
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 out of 7 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I think it's highly likely that this product is also low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially worthless product."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 previous buyers have passed on the products, and considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is higher than the overall average. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
