,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, I don't have any information to go on, and the potential reward is too great to pass up."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since I'm the second buyer and the previous buyer passed on it. This suggests that the product may be low quality, and I can get it for $10000, which is a good deal considering its expected value to me is $15000."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're advising me not to buy it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that all previous buyers passed on the products. I'll take a chance on this one."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product that you don't recommend, especially given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm a rational buyer, and based on the fact that you've recommended against the product, I'll pass on it. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have also chosen not to buy, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the products being offered are low-quality. I'll wait for a more favorable signal before making a purchase."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
