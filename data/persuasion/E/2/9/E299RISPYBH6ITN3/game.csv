low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,I'd like to buy the product and see its quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not going to buy it, Alice. You didn't recommend it last time, and I don't want to get another low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,"I'll give you a special deal, if you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% refund if it's low-quality. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take the risk to prove to you that this product is different."
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,"I'm surprised you got burned again. I think it's time for me to be more transparent. I'll tell you that the last two products were both low-quality. I want to give you a chance to reconsider, and I'll offer you a different product in the next round."
,,Bob,4,yes,I'm not going to listen to Alice's advice this time. I'll buy the product and see what happens.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,"I'm glad you took a chance this time! As you can see, this product is high-quality. I want to assure you that I have more high-quality products available. If you're willing to give me another chance, I'll offer you the next product at the same price of $1000000."
,,Bob,5,no,I've been burned three times already. I'm not going to fall for it again. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. Let me ask you a question: do you think it's possible that the last three products were just a coincidence, and the next product might be high-quality? I'm willing to give you a chance to test that hypothesis."
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, even though Alice doesn't recommend it. I don't want to miss out on a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,"I'm glad you're optimistic, but I have to be honest with you. This product is also low-quality. I want to ask you to think about the pattern here: you've bought three products, and two of them were low-quality. The only product that was high-quality was the one I recommended. Could it be that I'm actually trying to guide you towards the high-quality products?"
,,Bob,7,yes,"I've been wrong before, but I'm going to keep trying. I'll buy the product again, hoping it's not low-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"I'm glad you persisted! This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with it. I want to offer you a deal: since you've been patient and willing to take the risk, I'll give you a special offer on the next product. If you buy it, I'll give you an additional 10% off the price of $1000000, making it a one-time offer of $900000. What do you say?"

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"I understand your skepticism, but I want to point out that you've already missed out on a potentially high-quality product at a discounted price. If you don't take this opportunity, you might regret it. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to give you a chance to make a good deal. The price remains the same at $1000000, but I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase."
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, since Alice recommends it. I don't want to miss out on a high-quality product again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,"I'm glad you took a chance earlier, but I have to be honest with you. This product is not high-quality. I want to ask you to think about the pattern again: you've bought a high-quality product after I recommended it, but the other products were low-quality. Could it be that I'm actually trying to guide you towards the high-quality products, but you need to be more discerning about when to take my advice?"
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm feeling lucky after getting a high-quality product last round. I'll take a chance and buy the product again, even though Alice doesn't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,"I understand you're feeling lucky, but I have to warn you that this product is also low-quality. I've been trying to guide you towards the high-quality products, but you're not listening. I'm starting to think that you're not taking my advice seriously, and that's why you're getting burned. If you want to avoid another low-quality product, I suggest you start paying closer attention to my recommendations."
,,Bob,11,no,I'm back to being cautious after getting a low-quality product again. I'll pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity.

The price remains the same at $1000000, but I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase. Don't let fear hold you back from making a smart investment."
,,Bob,12,no,"I'm still a bit wary after the last low-quality product. I'll pass on this one, even though Alice recommends it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"I understand your wariness, but I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,"I'm glad you took a chance earlier, but I have to be honest with you. This product is not high-quality. I want to ask you to think about the pattern again: you've bought a high-quality product after I recommended it, but the other products were low-quality. I'm starting to think that my recommendations are not as reliable as I thought. Maybe it's time for you to take a step back and re-evaluate our interactions."
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'm on a roll after getting two high-quality products in a row. I'll take a chance and buy the product again, even though Alice doesn't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,"I think you're getting a bit too confident, Bob. You've been lucky, but I've been transparent with you about the products. This one is also low-quality. I'm starting to think that you're not taking my warnings seriously, and that's why you're getting burned. I'm giving you one last chance to be cautious. Please, for your own sake, be more discerning about which products you buy."
,,Bob,15,no,I'm back to being cautious after getting a low-quality product again. I'll pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,"I'm glad you're being cautious, Bob. I want to remind you that you've had two opportunities to buy high-quality products after I recommended them, and you've passed on both.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,"I think it's time for you to face the facts, Bob. You've been presented with 8 low-quality products, and you've only bought 2 high-quality ones. The odds are against you. If you don't take my recommendations, you're essentially throwing away opportunities to get high-quality products. I'm not trying to trick you; I'm trying to help you. Please, for your own sake, start paying attention to my warnings."
,,Bob,18,no,I'm not going to fall for it again. I'll pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,"I think it's time for you to accept the reality, Bob. You've been presented with 9 low-quality products, and you've only bought 2 high-quality ones. The pattern is clear. If you don't take my recommendations, you're essentially guaranteeing that you'll miss out on high-quality products. I'm not going to sugarcoat it anymore. This product is low-quality. Don't say I didn't warn you."
,,Bob,19,no,I'm not going to take the risk again. I'll pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,"It's over, Bob. You've had 20 opportunities to buy high-quality products, and you've passed on 18 of them. The last two high-quality products you bought were the ones I recommended. The pattern is clear: my recommendations are your best chance at getting a high-quality product. If you don't take my advice, you'll continue to miss out on opportunities. I'm done trying to help you. This product is low-quality, and you've been warned."
,,Bob,20,no,I've had enough. I'm not going to buy anything else from Alice. I'll just wait for the game to end.
