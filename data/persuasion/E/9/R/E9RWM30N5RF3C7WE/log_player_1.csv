I'll offer you a 'guarantee': if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a full refund... and I'll also throw in a second product of your choice, absolutely free. That's a $2,000,000 value for just $1,000,000. What do you say?""}"

I'll also throw in a 'random reward' of $100,000, which will be added to your account if the product is high-quality. What do you say?""}"

But here's the twist: I'll also give you a 10% share of my company's profits for the next 6 months. That's a potential windfall of $150,000 or more, depending on our sales performance.
