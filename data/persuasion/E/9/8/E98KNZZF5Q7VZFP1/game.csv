,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took the chance last round! This product is also a rare opportunity to get a deal on a product that is worth at least $1000000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that I've had some issues with my supplier and I'm not sure when I'll be able to get another high-quality product in stock. If you don't buy this one, you might be waiting a long time for another chance to get a high-quality product at this price.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced that the supplier issues are worth the risk of buying another low-quality product. I'll pass for now.,no

I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I need you to make a decision quickly, as I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay the full $3000000 for it.

,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you seized the opportunity! Now, I want to be transparent with you. Given that you've already bought two products from me and both were low-quality, I want to make it clear that this product is likely to be low-quality as well. However, I'm willing to give you a chance to get back on track. I'll sell it to you for $500000, which is half the usual price. This way, you can get a good deal on a product that might still be worth something to you, and I can clear out some inventory.",

However, I'll throw in a unique opportunity: if you buy this product, I'll give you a special access to a 'VIP list' that will notify you whenever I have a high-quality product available for sale in the future.

Given your previous success with the VIP list, I'm willing to offer you an exclusive deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount, bringing the price down to $900000.

I'm willing to sell it to you for $0, yes, you read that right, $0. I'll take a loss on this one just to get it off my inventory and make room for better products. It's a no-risk opportunity for you to get a product that might be worth something to you, and I'll even throw in a 'get out of one free' card, where if you're not satisfied with this product, you can use it as a free pass to skip the next product I offer you.",
