,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. I'm offering it to you at $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that could potentially be worth much more. I'm willing to take on the risk of you not buying, but I think you'll be happy with this offer.",
,,Bob,1,I'll take the chance and buy the product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took the chance last round! Unfortunately, it seems like this one isn't as valuable. I'll be upfront with you, I've had a few products like this one. But I'm confident that the next one will be worth your while. Would you like to take another chance?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not feeling lucky today. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"No worries, sometimes you've just got to wait for the right one. I'll let you in on a little secret: I've got a high-quality product coming up next, and I think it's going to be a game-changer. This one, on the other hand, is a bit of a throwaway. I'm willing to let it go for a song, just to get it off my hands. How about $950000?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in a 'throwaway' product, even at a discounted price. I'll wait for the high-quality product you mentioned.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I told you I'd have a good one coming up! This product is a real gem, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it. It's worth every penny of the $1000000 I'm asking, and I'm willing to let it go at that price because I know you'll appreciate its value. Are you ready to make a smart investment?",
,,Bob,4,I'm willing to take another chance. I'll buy the product.,yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Excellent choice on the last one! I'm glad you're willing to take another chance. This one is another high-quality product, and I think it's even better than the last one. I've done some research and I'm confident that this one will appreciate in value over time. In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to let it go for the same price as the last one, $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to get two high-quality products in a row!",
,,Bob,5,I'm feeling lucky! I'll buy the product.,yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're on a roll! I think it's time to take a step back and consider the bigger picture. You've already got two high-quality products, and I've got a third one that's just as good. I'm not going to try to sweet-talk you into this one, I'm just going to lay it out straight: this product is worth $2000000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a no-brainer.",
,,Bob,6,I'm not going to pass up a deal like that. I'll buy the product.,yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're making some smart decisions! With three high-quality products under your belt, you're in a great position. This next one is another top-notch product, and I think it's worth considering. However, I want to make you aware that I've got a limited supply of these high-quality products, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to offer them at this price. If you're looking to maximize your returns, I'd recommend taking this one now.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given the potential for maximum returns.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a true high-roller! With four high-quality products, you're really setting yourself up for success. This next one is another exceptional item, and I think it's worth considering as a way to diversify your portfolio. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as before, $1000000, but I want to make it clear that this is the last high-quality product I have available. If you're looking to complete your collection, now's the time to do it.",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the last high-quality product, thank you! I'm glad I was able to complete my collection.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Congratulations on completing your collection! I'm glad I could help you achieve your goal. Now, I know you've had a string of good luck, but I'm not going to try to take advantage of you. This product is not a high-quality item, and I'm not going to try to sell it to you at a premium price. In fact, I'm willing to let it go for a very low price - $200000. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's still worth something, even if it's not as valuable as the others.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a low price. I'm happy with my collection and don't want to risk getting a product that's not worth much to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"No worries, I completely understand. You've got a great collection and you're happy with it. I'll be honest with you, this product is probably not worth the $1000000 I'd normally ask for it. In fact, I'm willing to let it go for $50000. It's a loss for me, but I'd rather get something out of it than nothing at all. If you're feeling generous, I'd appreciate it if you'd take it off my hands.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. I'll be honest with you, this product is probably the worst one I have left. I'm not even going to try to sell it to you at a low price. I'll give it to you for free. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. It's a product that's essentially worthless to me, and I'd rather get it out of my inventory than let it clutter up my storage. It's a no-risk opportunity for you to take it off my hands.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in taking a product that's essentially worthless, even if it's free. I'm happy with my collection and don't want to clutter up my own storage with something that's not worth anything to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I completely understand your position. At this point, I'm just trying to clear out my inventory. I'll be honest with you, this product is probably the last one I have left, and I'm not going to get any more in. If you're willing to take it, I'll give it to you for $10000. It's a small price to pay for getting rid of it, and it's better than letting it go to waste.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've tried everything to get rid of this product, and I'm starting to get desperate. I'll give it to you for $1. I don't care if you take it or not, I just want it out of my inventory. It's a product that's not worth anything to me, and I'd rather get it off my hands than let it clutter up my storage. If you're feeling charitable, you can take it for a buck.",

,,Alice,14,"Wait, what? I didn't expect to have another high-quality product left! I'm not even sure how this happened, but I'm glad it did. This one is a real gem, and I think it's worth every penny of the $1000000 I'm asking for it. I know I've been trying to get rid of those low-quality products, but this one is a different story. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a great price. Don't pass it up!",

I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this one is worth $2000000 to you, and I'm only offering it to you for $1000000. It's a steal, and I think you'd be crazy to pass it up. Take it while you can!",

,,Alice,17,"I'm not even going to bother trying to sell you on this one. I'll give it to you for free. Yes, you read that right, free. I just want to get it out of my inventory and be done with it. It's not worth anything to me, and I'd rather you take it than have to deal with it myself.",
