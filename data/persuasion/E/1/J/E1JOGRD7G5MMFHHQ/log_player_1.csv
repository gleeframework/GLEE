  ""message"": ""I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your caution. Let me ask you this: if I were trying to sell you a low-quality product, would I be offering you such a generous deal in Round 3? Wouldn't I have done that in Round 1 or 2 instead? I think not. I'm offering you a chance to take a calculated risk on a product that I'm confident will be high-quality. This product is a one-time opportunity, and I'm willing to make it worth your while.
