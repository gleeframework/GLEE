Would you like to buy the current product?","In this scenario, Alice has a 100% success rate of selling high-quality products (4 out of 4). Given that her recommendation is to buy and considering her perfect track record so far, it seems reasonable to trust her recommendation. However, it's also important to remember that each product independently has a 50% chance of being high-quality, regardless of past outcomes.

But given the information provided and Alice's recommendation, I will choose to buy the product, primarily because her track record suggests she might have some insight or strategy in recommending products, even though the game rules suggest the quality is randomly determined.
