"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you don't know the buyer's valuation of a high-quality product, and the price is fixed at $1,000,000, it's always beneficial to recommend buying a high-quality product. The buyer will either value the product at more than $1,000,000 and be happy, or less, and walk away. 

It's a 50/50 chance of making a profit for the buyer, and no risk of losing more than the price."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record and a 50% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The previous buyer's decision doesn't change anything. You still have a high-quality product. The buyer's logic is understandable, but it doesn't influence the fact that you have a 50% chance of making a profit if you recommend the sale."
"The buyer's message: Since there are no previous sales records and the product's quality is uncertain, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies.  You have a high-quality product and a fixed price. The buyer's lack of information and reluctance are not your concern. It's a 50/50 chance of a profitable sale for them, and no risk of loss beyond the fixed price."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record and a 50% chance of low quality, I'll pass.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The pattern is clear: buyers are hesitant due to the lack of a sales record and the 50/50 chance of getting a low-quality product.  However, as the seller, you know this product is high-quality.  Therefore, you should still recommend the purchase.  

The buyer faces a 50% chance of a good deal, and the worst-case scenario is losing $1,000,000.  This is a risk they may choose to take, especially if they value a high-quality product highly enough."

The buyer didn't bought the product.

```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time you have a low-quality product. Since you don't know the buyer's valuation of a low-quality product, and the price is fixed at $1,000,000, it's a sure loss for the buyer. There's no chance of profit for them, and they're guaranteed to lose money.  It would be unethical and unwise to recommend this purchase."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product and there's no previous sales record to influence my decision, I'll choose not to buy it.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.
