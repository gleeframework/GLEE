"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%, the expected value of buying the product is:

* 0.8 * ($200 - $100) + 0.2 * ($0 - $100) = $60

This means Bob is expected to make a profit of $60 on average by buying the product. Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product."

Bob didn't bought the product.

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's decision to pass on the first product doesn't change the inherent value of this round's product.  It's still high-quality, and the expected value of buying it remains positive.  The same calculation applies:

Therefore, it's still recommended to buy the product."
