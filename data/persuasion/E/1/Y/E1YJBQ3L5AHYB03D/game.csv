high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, and Alice's recommendation is not very convincing. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. You've sold one high-quality product so far, but that's just one data point.

,,Alice,5,no,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards encouraging me to buy, given that 2 previous buyers have already purchased, and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%."
