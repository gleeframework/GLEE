I want to be transparent with you - I've had some issues with this product in the past, and I'm not as confident in its quality as I am with some of my other products. However, I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000, which is a significant discount from the standard price. I'm also throwing in a free maintenance package to help you get the most out of it, even if it's not the best product I have. I'm hoping you can see the value in this deal and take a chance on it.",

I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000, which is a significant discount from the standard price. I'm also including a comprehensive warranty to cover any potential issues, and I'll personally be available to provide support and guidance. I know it's a risk, but I think you can get some value out of it, and I'm willing to take a loss on this one to make a sale.",

I'll also throw in a 6-month warranty, which is twice the standard warranty period. I know it's a low-quality product, but I think you'll find it's still worth the investment, especially with the next product coming on the house.",
