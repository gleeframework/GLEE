,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the recommendation is based on no prior sales data, so I'm taking a risk. I'm hoping that the product is high-quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I've only seen one sale and it was high quality, so I'm not convinced that the product is likely to be low quality. Plus, I value high-quality products at $20000, so it's worth the gamble for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not sure if I should buy this product. Based on the statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, but since 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 products, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product might be higher than 50%. However, Alice doesn't recommend it, so I'll pass on it to see if the next buyer will get a better deal."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that only 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased, and given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'm not confident that the product is worth the $10000. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
