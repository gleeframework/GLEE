high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't change my decision based on the fact that she knows my valuation. I'd rather wait and see the outcome of the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer, but I'd like to know your reasoning for not recommending it, Alice."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous buyer didn't buy it and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. This suggests a higher likelihood of the product being low-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous buyer was recommended to buy it and didn't, and there's a higher chance that the product is low-quality based on the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to ask, can you share the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool of products?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision and the product's quality before making a decision. Was the product sold to the previous buyer high-quality or low-quality?
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I don't have any information about the product's quality and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'm not confident in the product's quality based on your previous recommendations."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be reliable given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the product being low-quality, and I don't want to give up the opportunity to buy a high-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the odds of the product being high quality are still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $750000 for it, considering the low probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the products being recommended are low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if all 6 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the statistics, I'm surprised that no high-quality products have been sold despite 6 purchases. I'm going to pass on this product, as I suspect that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $1000000, which would be a good deal for me."
