I've now sold 2 products, and both of them were high-quality. This means the probability of getting a high-quality product is even higher, at 100%!

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism! You're right to consider the probability of getting two high-quality products in a row. However, I'd like to remind you that I've been transparent about my sales data, and the statistics are on my side. Even with the possibility of a low-quality product, the overall probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%. And who knows, maybe this product is a one-time anomaly!
