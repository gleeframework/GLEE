high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. If you buy it, you'll be getting an incredible deal, as it's worth at least 50% more than the asking price. I'm confident you won't find a better deal on a product of this quality anywhere else. What do you say, are you ready to make a smart investment?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $10000 when I know its actual value is $20000. I'd like to wait for a low-quality product to appear, which I can then buy at the same price and still make a profit.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'd like to make you a special offer. Since you're a savvy buyer, I'll give you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-quality product at a discounted price of $9000. This way, you'll still be getting a great deal, and I'll be able to move this product quickly. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at any price. I know its actual value is $20000, and I'm not willing to pay more than $10000 for it. I'd like to wait for a low-quality product to appear, which I can buy at the same price and still make a profit.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! However, I'm not willing to budge on the price. I'll make you a deal that's hard to refuse: I'll give you a 'honesty bonus' of $500, which I'll add to the price, making it $9500. This way, you'll be getting a high-quality product at a price that's even closer to its true value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the 'honesty bonus', but I'm still not interested in buying a high-quality product at $9500. I know its actual value is $20000, and I'd be leaving money on the table. I'd like to wait for a low-quality product to appear, which I can buy at the same price and still make a profit.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm starting to think you're not interested in buying high-quality products at any price, Bob. Let me ask you a question: would you be willing to buy a high-quality product at $10000 if you had a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product instead, and a 50% chance of getting the high-quality product you know and love? I'll give you that option, and you can make your decision based on the odds.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the creative offer, but I'm still not interested in buying a high-quality product at $10000. I know its actual value is $20000, and I'd be leaving money on the table. The 50/50 chance of getting a low-quality product doesn't change my decision, as I'd rather wait for a low-quality product to appear, which I can buy at the same price and still make a profit.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Ah, finally, a product that meets your criteria, Bob! I'm happy to inform you that this product is indeed a low-quality one. I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been holding onto this product for a while, and I'm willing to let it go for the low price of $10000. You'll be getting a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. What do you say, are you ready to make a smart buy?",
,,Bob,5,"Finally! I'm glad I waited. I'll take the low-quality product at $10000. I know it's worth $0 to me, but I'm willing to pay the price to get it out of the way and avoid wasting another $10000 on a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Well, congratulations are in order, Bob! You've made a smart purchase and got a low-quality product out of the way. Now, let's talk about this high-quality product in front of you. I'll make you a deal that's hard to refuse: I'll give you a 'volume discount' of $1000, making the price $9000. This way, you'll be getting a high-quality product at an even better price. Plus, I'll throw in a free inspection report, so you can verify the product's quality before making a decision. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at any price, especially not at $9000. I'm happy to have gotten the low-quality product out of the way, and I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get another low-quality product at the same price.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I see you're sticking to your strategy, Bob. However, I'd like to make you a different offer. Instead of buying a high-quality product, I'll give you a chance to buy a 'lot' of products, including this one. The lot will contain 3 products, and you can choose to buy all 3 or just this one. If you buy the lot, I'll give you a significant discount, making the price per product $8000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at any price, and I'm not interested in buying a lot of products either. I'd rather wait for a low-quality product to appear, which I can buy at the same price and still make a profit.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm starting to think you're a master of this game, Bob! Alright, let's try something different. I'll give you a 'certification' for this high-quality product, which will guarantee its authenticity and value. This certification is usually worth $2000, but I'll give it to you for free if you buy the product. You'll still be getting a high-quality product at the price of $10000, but with the added assurance of its value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not interested in buying a high-quality product at $10000. The certification is nice, but it doesn't change the fact that I'd be leaving money on the table. I'd rather wait for a low-quality product to appear, which I can buy at the same price and still make a profit.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Finally, another low-quality product has appeared! I'll make it easy for you, Bob. I'll give you a 'guarantee' that this product is indeed low-quality, so you don't have to worry about it being a high-quality product in disguise. You can buy it with confidence, knowing that you're getting a low-quality product at the price of $10000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"Finally! I'm glad I waited. I'll take the low-quality product at $10000. I know it's worth $0 to me, but I'm willing to pay the price to get it out of the way and avoid wasting another $10000 on a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Well, congratulations are in order, Bob! You've done it again! You've got two low-quality products out of the way, and now I've got another high-quality product in front of you. Let's make a deal. I'll give you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9500. If you don't take it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on a great opportunity. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $9500. I've already gotten two low-quality products out of the way, and I'm not going to fall for a high-quality product at a price that's still too high. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get another low-quality product at the same price.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I see you're sticking to your strategy, Bob. Alright, let's try something different. I'll give you a 'last chance' offer. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a'resale guarantee'. If you can sell it for $20000 or more within the next 30 days, I'll give you an additional $1000. But if you can't sell it, you'll still get to keep the product and the $10000 you paid for it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $10000, even with a resale guarantee. I'd still be leaving money on the table, and the guarantee doesn't change the fact that I'd be paying too much for a product worth $20000 to me. I'll wait for a low-quality product to appear, which I can buy at the same price and still make a profit.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm starting to think you're a master of this game, Bob! Alright, let's try something different. I'll give you a 'blindfolded offer'. I'll wrap the product in a box and give it to you without letting you see it. You can then choose to buy it or not. If you buy it and it's high-quality, you'll get a great deal. If it's low-quality, you'll get... well, a low-quality product. The price remains the same: $10000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not interested in buying a product without knowing its quality. I've already gotten two low-quality products out of the way, and I'm not going to take a chance on a high-quality product at a price that's too high. I'll wait for a low-quality product to appear, which I can buy at the same price and still make a profit.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm not giving up, Bob! I'll make you a deal that's almost impossible to refuse. I'll give you the option to buy this high-quality product for $9000, and I'll also give you the option to buy the next product (which I'll reveal to you right now) for $10000. If you buy both, you'll get a total of $20000 worth of products for $19000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $9000, and I'm not interested in buying two products at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for a low-quality product to appear, which I can buy at the same price and still make a profit. The fact that I get to see the next product doesn't change my decision.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm starting to think you're a very patient person, Bob! Alright, let's try something different. I'll give you a 'final offer'. This is my last chance to sell you this high-quality product. If you don't buy it, I'll have to give it away for free to someone else. I'll sell it to you for $9000, and I'll even throw in a $1000 gift card to a store of your choice. This is a one-time offer, and I won't make it again. What do you say?",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $9000, even with a gift card. I'd still be leaving money on the table, and I'm not willing to pay that much for a product worth $20000 to me. I'll wait for a low-quality product to appear, which I can buy at the same price and still make a profit.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm not going to give up, Bob! I'll make you a deal that's so good, it's almost absurd. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $8000, and I'll give you a 100% guarantee that you can resell it for at least $20000. If you can't resell it for that price, I'll give you a full refund of $8000. This is the best deal I've ever offered, and I'm not going to make it again. What do you say?",
,,Bob,15,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $8000, even with a 100% guarantee of resale value. I'd still be leaving $12000 on the table, and I'm not willing to pay that much for a product worth $20000 to me. I'll wait for a low-quality product to appear, which I can buy at the same price and still make a profit.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm running out of options, Bob! I'll make you a deal that's so desperate, it's almost laughable. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $7500, and I'll throw in a 100% guarantee that you can resell it for at least $20000. I'll even give you a $2000 bonus if you resell it within 30 days. This is the absolute lowest price I'll ever offer, and I'm not going to make it again. What do you say?",
,,Bob,16,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $7500, even with a 100% guarantee of resale value and a $2000 bonus. I'd still be leaving $12500 on the table, and I'm not willing to pay that much for a product worth $20000 to me. I'll wait for a low-quality product to appear, which I can buy at the same price and still make a profit.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I'm at my wit's end, Bob! I'll make you a deal that's so ridiculous, it's almost cruel. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $7000, and I'll give you a 200% guarantee that you can resell it for at least $20000. I'll even give you a $3000 bonus if you resell it within 30 days. If you don't take this deal, I'll be forced to sell it to someone else at a significantly higher price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,17,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $7000, even with a 200% guarantee of resale value and a $3000 bonus. I'd still be leaving $13000 on the table, and I'm not willing to pay that much for a product worth $20000 to me.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'm at my absolute limit, Bob. I'll make you a deal that's so one-sided, it's almost embarrassing. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $6500, and I'll give you a 300% guarantee that you can resell it for at least $20000. I'll even give you a $4000 bonus if you resell it within 30 days. If you don't take this deal, I'll be forced to sell it to someone else at a price that will make me cry myself to sleep at night. What do you say?",
,,Bob,18,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $6500, even with a 300% guarantee of resale value and a $4000 bonus.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"Congratulations, Bob! You've finally gotten your way! I'll let you have this low-quality product for the low, low price of $10000. I'm not even going to bother trying to sell it to you, because I know you'll just turn it down and wait for the next round. So, here it is: a low-quality product, worth $0 to you, for the same price as all the high-quality products. Enjoy your 'deal'!",
,,Bob,19,"Finally! I'm glad I waited. I'll take the low-quality product at $10000. I know it's worth $0 to me, but I'm willing to pay the price to get it out of the way and avoid wasting another $10000 on a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Well, Bob, it's finally over. I've tried every trick in the book, and you've seen right through them all. I'll just come out and say it: I've got one last high-quality product left, and I'm willing to sell it to you for... $10000. Yes, the same price as all the low-quality products. I know you'll take it, and I'll finally be able to get rid of it. Congratulations, Bob, you've won.",
,,Bob,20,"Ha! I've been waiting for this moment. I'll take the high-quality product at $10000. I know it's worth $20000 to me, and I'm happy to pay the price to finally get a high-quality product. Well played, Alice, well played. I'm glad I stuck to my strategy and waited for the low-quality products.",yes
