,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."

,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not going to buy it based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the current statistics.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, especially since the previous two buyers didn't take the product. Can you tell me more about the product's quality? Is it more likely to be high or low quality based on the previous sales record?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm suspicious that the products being offered are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products may be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the expected 50%. This might indicate that the products being sold are biased towards low-quality ones. I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,

,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know what the quality of the previous products were."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the product is high quality based on the previous sales record. 3 buyers have already passed on the product, and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd rather wait for another opportunity."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 3 out of 3 products have been low-quality so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, since the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0, and I'm the 4th buyer. I'll take a chance and buy it."
