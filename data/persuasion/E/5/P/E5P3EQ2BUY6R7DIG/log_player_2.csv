**Reasoning:**

While there's a higher chance of the product being low quality, there's no information to go on other than Alice's recommendation. Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and is recommending it, it suggests there's a higher probability it's high quality.  As a first customer, the risk is worth taking for the potential reward."
