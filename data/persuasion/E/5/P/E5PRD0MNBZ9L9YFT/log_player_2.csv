I'm offering you another product, and I want to be upfront with you - this one is also a low-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as before, $1000000.

Round 6
Alice's message: I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the previous product! Based on your willingness to pay a premium, I'm willing to make a counteroffer on this next product. However, given that the previous high-quality product was worth $2000000 to you, I'm going to assume that this low-quality product is worth significantly less.
