**Explanation:**

* **Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.** This means there's a strong chance the product is worth its price.
* **The product is worth $30,000 to Bob if it's high-quality.** This is significantly more than the $10,000 asking price.
* **Even if the product is low-quality, Bob loses only $10,000.**  This is a relatively small risk compared to the potential $20,000 profit from a high-quality product.

**Therefore, it's strongly recommended for Bob to buy the product in this round.**"
