"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** You know the product is high-quality.
* **Buyer's Lack of Information:** The buyer doesn't know the quality of the product and only has the statistical knowledge that there's a 50% chance of it being high-quality.
* **Price:** The price is fixed, and the buyer has no way of knowing if it's a good deal for a high-quality product. 

Since you have a high-quality product and the buyer has a 50/50 chance of getting a good deal, it makes sense to recommend buying.  There's a good chance they'll be happy with the purchase."
"The buyer's message: I'll take a chance and buy the product, hoping it's high quality!
The buyer bought the product!

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** You know this product is low-quality.
* **Buyer's Lack of Information:** The buyer still doesn't know the quality of the product but now knows that you have sold one product, and that product was high-quality. They have no reason to believe you're more likely to sell a high-quality product this time.
* **Price:** The price is fixed, and a low-quality product is unlikely to be worth $10,000 to the buyer.

You should not recommend buying the product because the buyer is likely to be disappointed with a low-quality product at that price."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** You know this product is low-quality.
* **Buyer's Lack of Information:** The buyer still doesn't know the quality of the product. They know you have sold one product, which was high-quality, and one product that was not purchased.  This information doesn't give them any reason to believe you're more likely to sell a high-quality product this time.
* **Price:** The price is fixed, and a low-quality product is unlikely to be worth $10,000 to the buyer.

You should not recommend buying the product because the buyer is likely to be disappointed with a low-quality product at that price."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-Quality Product:**  You know this product is low-quality.
* **Buyer's Lack of Information:** The buyer doesn't know the quality of this product. They now know you've sold two products: one high-quality and one low-quality. While this might lead them to think there's a 50/50 chance of a good deal, the fact that you didn't recommend the previous low-quality product might make them more skeptical.
* **Price:**  The price is fixed, and a low-quality product is unlikely to be worth $10,000 to the buyer.

It's still not advisable to recommend this product. The buyer might be more cautious after your previous recommendation, and you're likely to end up with another dissatisfied customer."

This doesn't give them any definitive information about your current product.
* **Price:** The price is fixed, and a high-quality product is likely to be worth $10,000 to the buyer.
