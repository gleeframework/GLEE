``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the true quality of the product, her recommendation is valuable information. In this scenario, it is always advantageous to buy the product because even if it is low quality, you lose only $100. However, if it is high quality, you gain $25 ($125 value - $100 price).  This positive expected value makes buying the product the optimal strategy."
