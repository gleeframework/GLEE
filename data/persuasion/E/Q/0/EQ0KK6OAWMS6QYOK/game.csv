,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is 50% and the probability of it being low-quality is 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I think it's likely that the next product will be high-quality, and I don't want to miss that opportunity."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that all previous products were low quality. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous 3 buyers received recommendations to buy and all of them were low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I'm going to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your recommendation and the fact that none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems like Alice has recommended 3 products and none of them were high-quality. Given that there's a 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product to see if Alice's recommendation changes as the sales record changes."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I think the lack of high-quality products sold might be due to the fact that the previous buyers were not interested, not because the products are actually low-quality. I'd like to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide me with more information about the previous sales. How many products were sold in total, and what's the probability that a product is high quality based on the previous sales?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality and not worth $10000 to me."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering your past recommendations haven't been very promising."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers were discouraged by Alice's recommendations, and none of them bought the product. Given the lack of evidence of high-quality products being sold, I'm inclined to follow the trend and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 7 buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%.
