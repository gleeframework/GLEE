,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! As for this one, I want to be upfront with you: I'm having a bit of a clearance sale, and I need to move some of my inventory. This product is a great opportunity to get a'steal' - it's a low-quality item, but I'll let you have it for $50. It's a chance to get a product for almost nothing, and I'm willing to take a loss on it just to make some space in my inventory.",
