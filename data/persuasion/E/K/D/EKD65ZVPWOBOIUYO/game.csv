,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 out of 1 previous buyer didn't buy the product, and 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it, which makes me think it's probably low-quality. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the low success rate of high-quality products being sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,11,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the probability of a high-quality product is still high enough to make it worthwhile."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyers' experiences and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality. I'd like to see more evidence of high-quality products being sold before I make a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the current statistics.
