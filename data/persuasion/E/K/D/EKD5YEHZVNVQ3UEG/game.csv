,,Bob,4,"The previous inspection didn't quite work out as I had hoped, and I'm not convinced that this deal is genuine. The bonus gift sounds appealing, but I'm not willing to risk another $1000000 on a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality.",no

If you win the auction, you'll get the product at a price you set. If it turns out to be high-quality, you'll get the full $2000000 value. If it's low-quality, you'll get your bid back. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"A blind auction sounds like a more transparent approach. Since I'll get my bid back if the product is low-quality, I'm willing to take a chance. I'll bid $1000000, which is the same price you've been offering all along. If I win the auction and the product is high-quality, I'll get the full $2000000 value, which is a good deal for me.",yes

If it's high-quality, I'll get the full $2000000 value, which is a good return on investment. If it's low-quality, I'll walk away without losing anything.",yes

,,Bob,11,"A product preview and a 60-day money-back guarantee sound like a good start, but I'm still not convinced. I've seen that your previous assurances and guarantees haven't been reliable. I'd like to take it a step further and request a third-party inspection or verification of the product's quality before making a purchase. If the product is high-quality, I'll consider buying it at the usual price of $1000000.",no
