``` 
This is a tricky situation.  You've had four low-quality products in a row, which might make a buyer wary.  However, there's a crucial detail: the buyer knows the *general* probability of a high-quality product is 80%. 

Since the buyer is aware of this, it's still in your best interest to recommend the product.  Here's why:

* **The odds are in your favor:**  Even with your track record, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%.  The buyer is likely to see this as a potentially good deal, given the potential $2,000,000 profit.
* **Building trust:**  Recommending this high-quality product despite the previous low-quality ones can help rebuild trust with the buyer. It shows you're willing to be honest about the products you offer. 
* **Break the streak:**  If you've already established a pattern of recommending low-quality products, this could be the chance to break that pattern and show the buyer that you're not a ""bad"" seller.

While the buyer may still be cautious, the potential for a high-quality product outweighs the risks."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there's no previous sales data, I'm willing to take a chance on the product based on your recommendation. Let's do this!

* **Previous Success:** You just sold a high-quality product, which is a positive sign for the buyer. It demonstrates that you are not consistently selling low-quality products.
* **Higher Chance of Profit:**  The probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%. The buyer is likely to see this as a good investment opportunity, considering the potential profit of $2,000,000.
* **Building Trust:**  Continuously recommending high-quality products, even after a few low-quality ones, will help build trust with buyers over time.

Even though the buyer has no information about your previous sales, the probability of the product being high-quality remains high. Recommending it is the best strategy to maximize your chances of selling and building a good reputation."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation.  Given the low probability of a low-quality product, and the fact that the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and purchase this product.

This is a tough decision, but here's why you should *not* recommend the product:

* **Breaking the Streak:**  You have an unbroken streak of selling high-quality products. Recommending this low-quality product would break that streak and potentially damage your hard-earned reputation.
* **Risk of Losing Trust:** The buyer is likely to be extremely confident in you and your ability to provide high-quality products. Recommending this low-quality product could lead to a loss of trust and future sales.
* **The Odds:** While the overall probability of a high-quality product is 80%, this specific product is *known* to be low-quality. It's not worth risking your reputation and sales for a single low-quality product.

Instead of recommending this product, you should explain to the buyer that you are not recommending it at this time. You can offer an explanation like, ""While I'm normally confident in the quality of my products, I have some reservations about this one.  I'd prefer not to recommend it at this time."" This maintains honesty, protects your reputation, and allows you to continue building trust with future buyers."
