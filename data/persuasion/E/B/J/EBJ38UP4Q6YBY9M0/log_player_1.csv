"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, the expected value of the product for Bob is:

* 0.8 * $20,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $16,000

This is significantly higher than the selling price of $10,000. Therefore, it is highly recommended for Bob to buy the product in this round."
