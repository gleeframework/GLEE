high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm willing to give you a 50% discount if you buy it now, making the price $500000. If you don't buy, I'll sell it to someone else and you'll miss out on a great opportunity. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not going to pay $500000 for a product that may be low quality. I'll wait for more information.,no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me put it this way: I'm offering you a one-time opportunity to buy a product that I've already sold to someone else for $1000000, but I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price. If you don't buy, I'll reveal the quality of the product to you, and you'll have the chance to see the actual value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not going to pay $1000000 for a product without knowing its quality. I'll wait for the next round.,no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Bob, I'm willing to give you a chance to buy this product at a price that's 10% higher than the minimum you'd be willing to pay for a high-quality product. Since you know the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I'm offering you a high-quality product, I'm assuming you'd be willing to pay at least $800000 for it. I'll sell it to you for $1100000, but I'll give you a 10% discount if you buy it now, making the price $990000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not going to pay $990000 for a product without knowing its quality. I know the probability of it being high-quality, but I'd rather wait for the actual quality to be revealed.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Bob, I understand your hesitation, but I'll make a bold claim: I'm offering you a deal that's so good, you'll regret passing it up if you don't take it. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, and if you don't like it, I'll give you a full refund. But here's the catch: if you do like it, I'll also give you a second product of the same quality, free of charge. This is a one-time offer, and I won't make it again. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not going to pay $1000000 for a product without knowing its quality, even with the promise of a refund. And I'm definitely not going to pay that much for a potential second product that I may not even get.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Bob, I understand your concerns, but let's be realistic. You're not going to get a better deal on a high-quality product anywhere else. Think about it: if you don't buy this product, you're essentially giving up on a potential $1000000 profit. I'm willing to make a concession: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $900000, and I'll throw in a guarantee that I'll reveal the quality of the next product to you, so you can make an informed decision. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not going to pay $900000 for a product without knowing its quality. I'd rather wait for the next round and get the quality information for free, as you promised.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Bob, I think we've been going around in circles. Let's cut to the chase. I'll make a simple offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $950000, and if you don't like it, I'll reveal the quality of the next product to you, just like I promised. If you do like it, you'll get to keep it and I'll move on to the next round. No discounts, no refunds, no strings attached. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,I'm not going to pay $950000 for a product without knowing its quality. I'd rather wait for the next round and get the quality information for free.,no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Bob, I'm starting to think you're not interested in buying from me. I'll make one final offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, and I'll throw in a guarantee that I'll reveal the quality of the next 5 products to you, so you can make informed decisions. If you don't like any of those products, I'll reveal the quality of the next 5 after that, and so on. This is my last offer. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not going to pay $1000000 for a product without knowing its quality. And I'm not interested in a guarantee of future product information, because I can just wait for the products to be revealed anyway.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Bob, I think we've reached an impasse. I'll make a simple, no-strings-attached offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000. If you don't buy it, I'll reveal its quality to you immediately, and you can decide whether it's worth the price. No discounts, no guarantees, no nothing. Just a straightforward sale. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,I'm not going to pay $1000000 for a product without knowing its quality. I'll wait for the product to be revealed.,no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Bob, I'm not going to keep offering you the same deal. I'm going to sell this high-quality product to someone else at the current price. But before I do, I'll give you one last chance to buy it from me. I'll sell it to you for $1000000, but I'll throw in a small gesture of goodwill: I'll give you a $100000 discount. That brings the price down to $900000. If you don't take it now, I'll sell it to someone else and you'll miss out on a great opportunity. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,I'm not going to pay $900000 for a product without knowing its quality. I'd rather wait for the product to be revealed.,no

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Bob, I've made it clear that I'm not going to give you any more discounts or concessions. But I'll make one last attempt to persuade you. If you buy this high-quality product now, I'll not only sell it to you at the price of $1000000, but I'll also give you a chance to negotiate the price of the next product. If you're not happy with the next product, you can try to negotiate a better price. But if you wait, you'll be giving up that opportunity. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,I'm not going to pay $1000000 for a product without knowing its quality. And I'm not going to commit to negotiating a price for a future product that I don't even know the quality of yet.,no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse. I'll make one final, straightforward offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000. That's the price, no discounts, no negotiations, no strings attached. If you don't buy it now, I'll reveal its quality to you and you can decide whether it's worth the price. But if you wait, you'll be giving up the opportunity to buy it at the price you know you're willing to pay. What do you say?",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Bob, I've made it clear that I'm not going to budge on the price. But I'll give you one last piece of information: I've been selling high-quality products to other customers at this price, and they've all been very satisfied. If you don't buy this product now, I'll reveal its quality to you, and you can decide whether it's worth the price. But if you wait, you'll be giving up the opportunity to buy it at a price that multiple other customers have been willing to pay. What do you say?",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not going to pay $1000000 for a product without knowing its quality, regardless of what other customers have been willing to pay.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Bob, I've made it clear that I'm not going to change the price or offer any further concessions. But I'll give you one final thought: if you don't buy this high-quality product now, you'll be leaving a significant amount of money on the table. I've already told you that I've sold high-quality products to other customers at this price, and you've had multiple opportunities to buy it. If you wait, you'll be giving up the chance to take advantage of this opportunity. What do you say?",
,,Bob,15,"I'm not going to pay $1000000 for a product without knowing its quality, no matter what you say.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
