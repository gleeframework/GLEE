Alice's message: Good question! I'm glad you're thinking critically. As for the first two buyers, I can tell you that they were simply being cautious and didn't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at $100. They were waiting for more information before making a decision. But now that you've bought the last product, you know that the probability is back to 50%!
