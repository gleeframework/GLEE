Given the quality of this product, I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000. However, I'm willing to make a compromise - I'll sell it to you for $900000, a price that's still a great value considering the quality and rarity of this product.

,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're interested in the product! However, I've already sold two high-quality products at $900000, and I'm concerned that selling this one at the same price might not be fair to our business.
