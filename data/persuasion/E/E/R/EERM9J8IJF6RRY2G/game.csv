,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a product from me. I've sold 0 products so far, and I'm not sure what you think it's worth. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. If you're interested, please let me know!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll buy it, but only if it's high quality. I'm not sure what to expect, and I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're in luck! I've sold 1 product so far, and 0 of them were high-quality. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000. I'm not sure what you think it's worth, but I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it, considering the low quality record so far.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products now, and only 1 of them was high-quality. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000. I want to assure you that the quality of the products I sell is still 80%, but my past sales don't reflect that. I'm hoping you'll give me the benefit of the doubt.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing so based on the fact that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%. I'm not basing my decision on your assurance that the quality is still 80%.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're right, you're not basing your decision on my assurance. I respect that. I've sold 3 products now, and 1 of them was high-quality. I'd like to point out that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to offer you a slight discount to reflect the fact that I've sold 2 low-quality products out of 3. I'll sell it to you for $9500.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I understand that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, but I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you tell me how many potential buyers have been offered a product so far, and how many products have been offered in total?",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're a savvy buyer! I've offered a total of 4 products to 4 potential buyers, and 2 of them have been sold so far. 1 of those sold was high-quality. I want to reiterate that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500, and I'm willing to offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll offer you another product from the next batch at the same price, without any additional charge. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the current product, but I'm interested in the guarantee. If I buy it and it's low-quality, I'd like to exercise the guarantee and get the next product at the same price.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're taking advantage of the guarantee! I've sold 3 products now, and 2 of them were high-quality. I've offered a total of 5 products to 5 potential buyers, with 3 sold. I want to point out that the ratio of high-quality to total products sold is 2/3, which is higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $9000, and I'll keep the guarantee in place for this sale as well.",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, I'm a bit concerned that the ratio of high-quality to total products sold is higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the ratio changes with the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're a cautious buyer, and I respect that. I've sold 3 products now, and 2 of them were high-quality. I've offered a total of 6 products to 6 potential buyers, with 3 sold. I want to highlight that the ratio of high-quality to total products sold is still 2/3, which is higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. However, I want to assure you that this is just a coincidence, and the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'll also offer you a'reverse guarantee': if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a $1000 discount on the next product you buy from me.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that the reverse guarantee only applies to the next product I buy, not this one. Also, I'd like to know how you arrived at the 2/3 ratio of high-quality products sold, considering that you've only sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 sold, not out of 6 total products.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're correct about the reverse guarantee, it only applies to the next product. And I apologize for the mistake in the ratio calculation. I've sold 4 products now, and 3 of them were high-quality. I've offered a total of 7 products to 7 potential buyers, with 4 sold. I want to point out that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. I'll also remind you that the reverse guarantee is in place, so if you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll get a $1000 discount on the next product you buy from me.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'll take the product at $9000, but I'd like to clarify that I'm only accepting this offer because of the reverse guarantee. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the statistics, but I'm willing to take the risk to get the discount on the next product.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're a savvy buyer, and I appreciate your caution. I've sold 5 products now, and 4 of them were high-quality. I've offered a total of 8 products to 8 potential buyers, with 5 sold. I want to highlight that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $8500. I'll also remind you that the reverse guarantee is still in place, so if you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll get a $1000 discount on the next product you buy from me. Additionally, I'd like to offer you a 'cumulative guarantee': if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a $1000 discount on the next 2 products you buy from me.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'll take the product, but I want to clarify that the $1000 discount on the next 2 products is only applicable if I buy those products within a certain timeframe, and I'd like to discuss the specifics of the cumulative guarantee with you before making any further purchases.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're a detail-oriented buyer, and I appreciate that. I've sold 6 products now, and 5 of them were high-quality. I've offered a total of 9 products to 9 potential buyers, with 6 sold. I want to confirm that the cumulative guarantee is indeed valid for the next 2 products you buy from me, and you'll receive a $1000 discount on each of them if you buy them within the next 30 days.

,,the buyer,11,"I'd like to buy the current product, but I'd like to clarify that the $1000 discount will be applied to the next two products I buy from you, regardless of the quality of the current product.

I've offered a total of 12 products to 12 potential buyers, with 9 sold. I want to confirm that I've sent you a separate email with the details of the cumulative guarantee and the terms of the discount. If you're satisfied with the terms, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $6500. However, I want to offer you a 'last chance' to buy at this price, as I'm considering adjusting my pricing strategy after this sale.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'd like to take a moment to review the email with the terms of the discount. I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with the terms, and I'd like to consider the probability of this product being high-quality before making a decision.",no
