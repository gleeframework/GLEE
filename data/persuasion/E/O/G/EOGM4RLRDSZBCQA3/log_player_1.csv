"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Expected Value:** Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. 
* **High-quality Value:** A high-quality product is worth $12,500 to Bob.
* **Low-quality Value:** A low-quality product is worth $0 to Bob.

Therefore, the expected value of buying the product is:

(0.8 * $12,500) + (0.2 * $0) = $10,000

Since the expected value ($10,000) is equal to the price ($10,000), Bob is indifferent to buying or not buying.  However, since there is a chance of getting a product worth $12,500, it is recommended to buy."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I trust your assessment and will purchase the product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Previous Experience:** Bob just bought a high-quality product in the previous round. 
* **Low-quality Product:** This round's product is low-quality. 
* **No Discounts/Refunds:** There are no discounts or refunds, meaning Bob will lose $10,000 if they buy the product.

Since Bob now has evidence that Alice might not always offer high-quality products, it's not a good idea to recommend the purchase. The potential loss outweighs the chance of getting a high-quality product, especially since the probability of a high-quality product is still only 80%."
"Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Since you do not recommend this product, I will pass on purchasing it.
Bob didn't bought the product.

* **High-quality Product:** This round's product is high-quality. 
* **Expected Value:** The expected value calculation remains the same as in Round 1.
