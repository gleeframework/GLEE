But I'm willing to let it go for $100, and I'll even give you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' deal: if you buy it, I'll throw in a free gift with purchase, but if you don't buy it, I'll just take it back and forget we ever had this conversation.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in a low-quality product, even if it's cheap. I've already had two high-quality products offered to me for $100, and I'm not going to settle for something that's not up to your usual standards.""}"
