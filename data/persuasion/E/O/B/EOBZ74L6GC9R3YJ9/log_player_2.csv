**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Since 7 out of 7 products sold have been high-quality, the success rate is 100%. This is significantly higher than the 80% inherent probability of a product being high-quality.
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the value of each product and is recommending this specific product. This suggests she knows it's high quality.
* **Limited Risk:** Even if it's a low-quality product (which is highly unlikely given the success rate), the worst-case scenario is losing $1,000,000.  However, the potential gain is $200,000. 

**Note:** While this strategy is based on the current data, it's important to remember that randomness exists.  There's always a chance (albeit a small one) that the next product could be low quality."
