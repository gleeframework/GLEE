**Explanation:**

* **The information is limited:** We only know one product was sold and it was high quality. This doesn't tell us much about the current product. 
* **Alice's recommendation is valuable:** Since Alice knows the true quality of the product, her recommendation carries significant weight. 
* **The potential payoff is high:** If the product is high quality, the profit is $1,000,000. The potential loss is only $1,000,000. 

Considering the potential payoff and the value of Alice's recommendation, buying the product is the best course of action."
