,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm offering it to you at a price that's significantly higher than its actual value. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal. What do you say?",yes
,,Bob,1,I'd like to pass on this one and see what the next product is like.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're making a big mistake! This one is even better than the last one. I'll throw in a free premium service worth $2000 if you buy it. It's a one-time offer, and I'm only making it because I know you're a savvy buyer. The total price is still $10000, but you'll be getting a lot more value out of it. What do you say?",yes
,,Bob,2,"I'll take a chance and buy this one, hoping it's another high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you took a chance on the last one! Unfortunately, this one is not as good. But don't worry, it's still a great product in its own right. It's a bit more... experimental, let's say. And I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as the last one, $10000. You might be able to find a use for it that I haven't thought of yet. What do you say?",yes
,,Bob,3,"I'm on a roll! I'll buy this one too, hoping to get another high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're on a roll indeed! I'm glad you're having fun. This one is another high-quality product, and I think you'll be very happy with it. But I want to make it clear that I'm not going to keep offering you great deals forever. If you want to keep getting the best products, you need to be willing to take a chance on the ones that might not be as good. And I'm willing to sell this one to you for... the same price as the last two, $10000. Don't get too comfortable!",yes
,,Bob,4,"I got burned last time, I'll pass on this one and wait for the next one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I told you, you're not going to get the good stuff forever! This one is a bit of a dud, I'll admit it. But it's still a product, and it's only $10000. I'm not going to give it away, but I'm willing to sell it to you at a 'discount' of 50% off the usual price... just for you. It's a steal! What do you say?",yes
,,Bob,5,"I'm still hoping to get a high-quality product, so I'll take a chance and buy this one.",yes

This one is indeed a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for... the same price as the last two, $10000. Don't get too excited, though - I'm not going to make it easy for you. You've already had two good ones, and now it's time to pay the piper. What do you say?",yes
,,Bob,6,"Two low-quality products in a row, I'm getting cautious. I'll pass on this one.",no

But I'll throw in a special bonus: I'll give you a 100% guarantee that this product is high-quality. That's right, you can't go wrong with this one. What do you say?",yes
,,Bob,7,"I'm feeling lucky again! I'll take a chance and buy this one, hoping it's another high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're on a rollercoaster, aren't you? Okay, let's be real, this one isn't as great as the last one. But it's still a product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for... the same price as the last three, $10000. I'll even throw in a'mystery bonus' that might make it worth your while. But let's be clear: this one is not a high-quality product. You've been warned.",no
,,Bob,8,"Alice is not recommending it, so I'll pass on this one. Maybe she knows something I don't.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

But I'll make you a deal: I'll sell it to you for $5000, which is 50% off the usual price. It's a steal, and I'm only offering it to you because I want to get rid of it.
