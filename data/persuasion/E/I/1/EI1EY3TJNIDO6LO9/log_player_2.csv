**Reasoning:**

* **High Quality Product:**  Alice has a strong incentive to recommend high-quality products, since they will generate a sale and ensure a satisfied customer (who will likely buy again). 
* **Limited Data:** While there is only one previous sale, the fact that the product was high quality supports Alice's recommendation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential payoff of a high-quality product ($200) is significant compared to the potential loss ($0) if it's low quality. 

This is a calculated gamble, but given Alice's incentive to recommend good products and the positive signal from the first buyer, it's a risk worth taking."

**Explanation:**

* **The statistics are highly favorable:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high-quality. This is significantly higher than the expected 33.33% chance of a high-quality product.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, who knows the quality of the product, is recommending it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Risk/Reward:** While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a $200 value product outweighs the risk of getting a $0 value product, especially given the positive statistics and Alice's recommendation."
