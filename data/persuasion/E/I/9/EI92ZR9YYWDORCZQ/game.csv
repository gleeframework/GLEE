low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, since I don't have any information to go on yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take the product, as I've already lost $1000000 on a low-quality product, and I'm hoping to get lucky with the next one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the previous two low-quality products, I'll pass on this one and hope for a better outcome in the next round."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'm going to take the recommendation this time, as I've already lost two low-quality products and this one has a chance to be worth $3000000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I've had two low-quality products in a row, but I've also had one high-quality product. I'll take a chance and buy this one, hoping to get another high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I've had three low-quality products in a row, but I still have one high-quality product that made up for the loss. I'll take another chance, as the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I've had four low-quality products in a row, which is starting to look like a pattern. I'll take another chance, but I'm getting a bit more cautious."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Five low-quality products in a row is a strong indication that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%. I'll take another chance, but I'm starting to think that Alice might be trying to sell me a bunch of low-quality products."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,

,,Bob,13,no,"I've been burned seven times in a row, and now Alice is recommending a product? I'm not falling for it. I'll pass on this one."

,,Bob,15,no,"I've had two high-quality products in a row, and Alice's recommendations have been correct both times. However, I'm not going to get caught in a trap. I'll pass on this one, as it's likely a low-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I was wrong to doubt Alice's recommendation again. I should have bought the high-quality product in Round 15. I'll pass on this one as well, but I'm starting to suspect that Alice might be trying to trick me into missing out on high-quality products."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"I've been burned nine times in a row, and now Alice is recommending a product? I'm not falling for it. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"It's the final round, and I've been burned nine times in a row. But I've also been passed over on two high-quality products, which suggests that Alice might be trying to help me out.
