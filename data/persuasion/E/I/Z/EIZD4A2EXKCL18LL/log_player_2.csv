**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** The data is very limited.  Only one product has been sold, and it was high quality. This is not enough information to make a statistically sound decision.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, and while she doesn't know the value to you, her recommendation suggests she believes it is high quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product ($120) significantly outweighs the potential loss of a low-quality product ($0). 
* **First-Mover Advantage:** Since you're the second buyer, you have the advantage of seeing how the first buyer fared. Since the first buyer bought and it was high quality, it's a slightly more positive sign.

**Overall, given the limited information, taking a risk and buying the product seems like the best strategy.**"
