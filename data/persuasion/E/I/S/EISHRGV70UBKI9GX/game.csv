,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of the previous buyer and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, which is a strong indication that the products are mostly low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales rate and the fact that you're recommending against it. I'd like to buy the product and see its quality for myself."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't think the recommendation is reliable given the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to determine the probability of a high-quality product being offered, and I'd like to update my estimate based on the data from the previous buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be high-quality, since all the previous buyers passed on the recommended products and none of them were high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought, I'm inclined to think that the products they were offered were low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm going to pass on this product, hoping that the next product will be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality based on the past sales record. Since you're not recommending it, I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know your reasoning behind not recommending it to me. Is it because of the statistics, or is there something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low sales record of high-quality products is just a coincidence."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 8 buyers all passed on the products after your recommendations, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than the true probability of 33.33%. I'd like to take on the risk and buy the product to try to get a high-quality one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your previous sales record of 9 purchases with 0 high-quality products sold. This suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products sold, which makes me skeptical about the current product's quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that 9 out of 9 products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
