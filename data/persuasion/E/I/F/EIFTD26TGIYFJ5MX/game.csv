low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%.

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and your reasoning for not recommending it is that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 6, which is 0.00%. This is below the expected 50.00% if the products are randomly distributed. I'm skeptical about the product's quality."
