,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it based on the previous buyer's decision or the product's quality?"

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that Alice has recommended it, I'm concerned that it might be low-quality and I don't want to risk losing $1000000. I'd like to see more information about the product before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the previous buyer didn't buy it and the recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but rather on Alice's general strategy. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if I can get a better sense of the quality based on the updated statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the low probability of it being high quality based on the current statistics. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'm hoping for the best."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50% and I'm willing to take that chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also received recommendations to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. With a 50% chance of a product being high-quality, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%. However, the fact that the previous buyers were not able to identify the high-quality products makes me skeptical. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that Alice is not recommending the product and only 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Given the fact that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high quality, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
