"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $20,000 if it's high quality and $0 if it's low quality, and Alice knows the quality of the product, it's in her best interest to recommend the high-quality product.  There is no downside for you in accepting the recommendation, as you'll either gain $10,000 (buying a $20,000 product for $10,000) or lose $10,000 (buying a $0 product for $10,000).  Since the odds of a high-quality product are much higher (80%), it's a good bet to take."
