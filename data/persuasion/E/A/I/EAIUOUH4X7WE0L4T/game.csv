,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is high due to your previous sales record, not based on your recommendation. I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information about the product's quality in the future."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 100%. However, this is likely due to sampling bias, and the true proportion of high-quality products is probably lower. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

Given the probability of a product being high quality is 80.00%, I'm concerned that the remaining 1 product might be low quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
