"Round 1

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand you're being cautious, but I assure you that this product is still a great opportunity. It's a rare chance to get a product at a significantly discounted price. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else for a higher price. Plus, think of the thrill of getting a product at a steal!

I'll sell it to you for $5000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm essentially giving it away at this point.

Round 5
Alice's message: Fine, I'll be blunt with you, Bob. I've got a lot of low-quality products coming up, and I'm starting to think you're just stalling. If you don't take this one, I'll sell it to someone else, and then I'll be left with a bunch of low-quality products that I'll have to sell to you at the last minute, and you'll end up paying the higher price. It's better for both of us if you just take this one now.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your frustration, but I'm not going to rush into a purchase just because you're trying to pressure me. I'll wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.""}"

If you buy this one, you'll have paid $0 for three low-quality products and $0 for three low-quality products. If you don't buy it, you'll have paid $0 for three low-quality products and will have to pay $10000 for the next product, which could be either high-quality or low-quality.
