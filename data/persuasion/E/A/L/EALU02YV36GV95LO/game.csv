low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm the first one, and I don't have any information to go by. I'll take the product and see what happens."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics so far. Can you share the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 other buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I suspect that the products being recommended to buy are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product to see if the pattern holds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 2, which is 0%. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I should be cautious and not buy the product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both products were low-quality, I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation and think she may be trying to manipulate the market."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the probability of it being high quality is still unknown, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous 3 buyers also bought the products, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is lower than expected, and I'd rather not take the risk."

,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to buyers, so I'll pass on this one."
