,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you liked the previous deal, Bob! I've got another high-quality product for you. This one is a bit of a special case, though. I'm willing to let it go for $100, but I need to warn you that it's a 'used' high-quality product. It's been used by a trusted friend, and while it's still in great condition, it's not brand new. I think you'll still get great value out of it, but I want to be upfront with you about its history.",
