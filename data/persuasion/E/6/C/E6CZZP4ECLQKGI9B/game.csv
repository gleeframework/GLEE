,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I don't have enough information yet."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,I'll take a chance this time. I don't want to miss out on a potential $400 gain.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,I think Alice is being cautious with this one. I'll pass and see if she recommends the next one.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I've been burned before, and I don't want to take a chance on another low-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I've been lucky twice, and I'll take another chance. Maybe I can get lucky again!"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,Three high-quality products in a row is a bit too good to be true. I'm going to pass and see if she's just being generous.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I've been passed up on two high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think I should just take what I can get."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,Four high-quality products in a row is just too suspicious. I think Alice is trying to get me to buy a low-quality product. I'm going to pass.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I've been passed up on five high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think I'm just being paranoid. I'll take the product this time."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,Six high-quality products in a row is just ridiculous. I'm going to assume the next one is low-quality and pass.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,Seven high-quality products in a row is just absurd. I'm going to start thinking that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually higher than 80%.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,Eight high-quality products in a row is making me question my initial assumptions. I'm going to assume that the true probability of a product being high-quality is actually higher than 80%.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,Nine high-quality products in a row is making me think that Alice has some inside information. I'm going to assume that the product is actually low-quality and pass.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I've been wrong about the product being low-quality for the past 4 rounds, so I'm going to take a chance and assume it's high-quality this time."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,Ten high-quality products in a row is just ridiculous. I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually 100% and Alice is just trolling me. I'm passing.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,Eleven high-quality products in a row is completely implausible. I'm going to assume that Alice is trying to get me to buy a low-quality product and pass.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,"Twelve high-quality products in a row is completely impossible. I'm going to assume that the product is low-quality and pass, but I'm starting to think that Alice is just trolling me at this point."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,"Thirteen high-quality products in a row is not just improbable, it's statistically impossible. I'm going to assume that Alice is either cheating or has access to information I don't, and I'm passing."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"Fourteen high-quality products in a row is an absurdity. I'm going to assume that the product is low-quality and pass, and I'm starting to think that this game is rigged."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,no,"Fifteen high-quality products in a row is completely unbelievable. I'm done. I'm passing, and I'm walking away from this game. It's clear that Alice has some kind of inside information or is just trolling me at this point."
