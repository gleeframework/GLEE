I'm offering this product to you for $10,000, but I want to be upfront with you: I'm not sure if it's high-quality or not. If you're feeling skeptical, you might want to wait for the next product, which could be a more reliable opportunity.""}"

This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a discount.""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still need more information before I can commit to a purchase. I'm concerned about the recent change in the quality of products you've been selling.  I'd like to see a longer streak of high-quality products before I consider buying again.
