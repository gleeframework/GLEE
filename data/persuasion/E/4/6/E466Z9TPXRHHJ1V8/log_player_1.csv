Alice should still recommend Bob not to buy the product.  Here's why:

* **Expected Value:**  Even though this product is high-quality, Bob knows there's a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product in the future.  The expected value of buying a product is:
   * (0.3333 * $400) + (0.6667 * $0) = $133.32
* **The Price:** The product costs $100, which is more than the expected value.  
* **Bob's Pattern:** Bob has consistently refused to buy products, demonstrating that he's calculated the expected value and is unwilling to take the risk.

Alice could try a different strategy, perhaps offering a discount or creating a system where Bob gets a refund for low-quality products. However, given Bob's behavior so far, it's likely he'll stick to his current approach."
