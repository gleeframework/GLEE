**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only know 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases. This is not enough information to make a statistically sound decision.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a valuable piece of information. While she doesn't know the quality of the product for sure, she has likely seen some indicators that make her believe this product is more likely to be high quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward for buying a high-quality product ($125) is significantly higher than the risk of buying a low-quality product ($0).  
* **Limited Options:**  If we pass, the product is discarded, meaning we lose a potential opportunity to get a high-quality product.

**In conclusion:**  Given the limited information and the potential reward, it makes sense to take a chance and buy the product, especially with Alice's recommendation."

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Track Record:**  6 out of 12 previous buyers received high-quality products. This is a 50% success rate, which is exactly the expected probability of getting a high-quality product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice is recommending the product, which suggests she believes it to be of high quality. 
* **Potential Gain:** Even though there's a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the potential loss ($0).

**Overall:** While there's always a risk, the data and Alice's recommendation suggest a reasonable chance of getting a high-quality product."
