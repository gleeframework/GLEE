,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the fact that I'm the first buyer and I don't have any information about the product's quality yet. I'm essentially a neutral, uninformed buyer."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 product sold and no high-quality products sold, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is sold before making a decision."

,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the statistics. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%, which could make the product less valuable to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low sales rate of high-quality products so far. I'd like to buy the product and see if I get a high-quality one."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and would like to pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, which means the probability of the current product being low-quality is 100%. I'd rather pass on it."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision, especially since no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality, so I'm inclined to think that the current product is also low-quality."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the products Alice has been offering are mostly low-quality.

high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous three buyers were able to get a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall 80% chance. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products sold were low-quality, which is a very low probability. Given Alice's recommendation not to buy, I will pass on the product to avoid the risk of buying a low-quality product."
