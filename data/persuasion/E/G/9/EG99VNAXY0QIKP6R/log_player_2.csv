**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Since 6 out of 6 products recommended by Alice have been high-quality, there's a strong indication that she's able to accurately identify high-quality products. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even with the 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($300) far outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 
* **Trust in Alice:** Given the high success rate, it makes sense to trust Alice's recommendation and make the purchase."
