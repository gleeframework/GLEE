  ""message"": ""I've sold 1 high-quality product out of a total of 3 products so far. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10,000. I want to be transparent with you - I've now sold three products in total, and two of them have been low-quality. This suggests that my initial high-quality product was just a fluke, and the probability of this product being high-quality is actually lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price as before, but I'm not trying to hide the fact that the odds are against you.""
