This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, I know the product is high-quality.  Since Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, he should rationally assume there's a high chance this product is worth his while.  Even if he values low-quality products very low, the 80% chance of a high-quality product makes it a reasonable gamble at $100."
