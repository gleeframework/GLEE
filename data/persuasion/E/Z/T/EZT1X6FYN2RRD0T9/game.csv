To be honest, I'm not feeling very confident about this next product. In fact, I'm so unsure that I'm willing to sell it to you for $0. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free.

To be frank, I'm not even sure why you'd want to buy from me at this point. The odds are against me, and I've had a string of disappointments. But if you're feeling adventurous, I'll sell you this next product for $5000. I'm not even sure why I'm bothering, but I guess it's better than just giving it away.",
