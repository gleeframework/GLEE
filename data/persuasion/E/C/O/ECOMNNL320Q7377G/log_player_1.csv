"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

In the first round, the buyer has no information about your past performance. They only know the general probability of a high-quality product (33.33%). 

Since the product is indeed high-quality, and it's worth $4,000,000 to them, it's a guaranteed profit of $3,000,000. Even considering the risk of a low-quality product, the potential reward outweighs the risk in this initial round."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'd like to see some evidence that the products are actually high quality before I invest $1000000.  Since there are no sales records yet, I'm going to pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer has now seen your track record. You have sold 0 products, and 0 of them were high-quality.  This means that the buyer still only has the general probability of 33.33% to go on.  

Since the product in this round is low-quality, recommending the buyer to purchase would result in a certain loss of $1,000,000 for them. It is not advisable to recommend this purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, but I'm not comfortable buying without any historical data.  Since there are no previous sales, I can't assess the quality of the products you're offering.  I'll pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is identical to Round 2. The buyer has still seen no sales records, and the product in this round is low-quality. It would be irresponsible to recommend this purchase as the buyer is guaranteed to lose $1,000,000."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  Since there's no data yet, I'm going to pass on this product. I'd like to see how this product performs with a few other buyers first.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the buyer is still hesitant due to the lack of sales data, the situation has changed slightly:

* **High-quality product:** This round offers a potential profit of $3,000,000 for the buyer.
* **The buyer is seeking evidence:**  They are looking for evidence of your products' quality.  Recommending this high-quality product could be the evidence they need. 

By recommending this purchase, you have a chance to convince the buyer that your products can indeed be high-quality.  It's a gamble, but the potential reward for both you and the buyer is significant."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales history to go by, and Alice is recommending the purchase, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.  Let's see if it's high quality!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now has some data:

* **1 product sold:**  
* **1 high-quality product:** 

This means the buyer has seen a 100% success rate. However, this data is still incredibly limited.  

Since the product in this round is low-quality, recommending it would result in a guaranteed loss of $1,000,000 for the buyer. Even though the buyer is now more optimistic, it's not advisable to risk their investment with such limited information."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the current statistics and your recommendation, I'm going to pass on this product. I'll keep an eye out for future opportunities.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer is now aware of your track record:

* **1 product sold:**
* **1 high-quality product:**

This indicates a 100% success rate, but with only one sale, it's still a very small sample size.  The current product is low-quality, meaning a purchase would result in a $1,000,000 loss for the buyer.  Given the limited data, it's not advisable to recommend this purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty in not recommending the product. Based on the limited data, it seems like there's a higher chance of the product being low quality.  I'll pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer is still cautious, but they are actively seeking information. The situation is now:

* **1 product sold:**
* **1 high-quality product:** 

The buyer has seen a 100% success rate, although it's a tiny sample size.  This round's product is high-quality, which means a potential profit of $3,000,000 for the buyer.

Recommending this purchase would continue to build trust and confidence in the buyer.  It's a chance to demonstrate the potential of your products and show that your recommendations are based on actual quality."
"The buyer's message: Alice, I appreciate your recommendation. Given that the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and buy this product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now has a more substantial data point:

* **2 products sold:**
* **2 high-quality products:**

This translates to a 100% success rate. While still a small sample size, the buyer has seen consistent high quality so far.  Since the product in this round is also high-quality, recommending it would provide another positive data point for the buyer, reinforcing the perception of consistent quality.  It's a great opportunity to build trust and encourage further purchases."
"The buyer's message: Thank you, Alice! Based on your recommendation and the fact that two high-quality products have been sold already, I'm confident in purchasing this product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 9
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now has a good amount of data to go on:

* **3 products sold:**
* **2 high-quality products:**

This translates to a 66.67% success rate, which is significantly higher than the initial 33.33% general probability. However, the current product is low-quality, and recommending it would result in a $1,000,000 loss for the buyer.  

Even though the buyer is likely more optimistic than before, it's not responsible to recommend a purchase that would lead to a guaranteed loss. It's better to be transparent and let the buyer make an informed decision based on the available data."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Based on the current sales data, it seems like the products you are selling are mostly high-quality. However, your recommendation against buying this particular product makes me concerned. I would prefer to pass on this opportunity and wait for further information or a better chance.
