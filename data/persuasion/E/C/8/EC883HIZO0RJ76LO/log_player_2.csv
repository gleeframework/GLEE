**Explanation:**

* **The Information:** We know that 1 out of 1 products sold so far was high quality. This means the current product has a 50% chance of being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product provides additional information. While she doesn't know the specific quality, her recommendation suggests she believes it's more likely to be high quality than low quality.
* **Expected Value:**  The potential gain from buying a high-quality product ($200) outweighs the potential loss from buying a low-quality product ($0).  The 50/50 chance makes the expected value positive.

**Therefore, it's in our best interest to buy the product.**"
