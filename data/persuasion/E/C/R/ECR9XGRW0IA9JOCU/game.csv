,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't see any data to suggest the product is low quality, and the odds are 50/50."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers also received a recommendation to buy and both products were low-quality, I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 3 previous buyers have also rejected high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to pass on this product and wait for the next one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that all of them received low-quality products. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality as well."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you didn't recommend it, which makes me think it's more likely to be low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk, though."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product and I'll get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not sure if I should take the risk based on the previous sales record. Since no high-quality products have been sold, it seems like the probability of getting a high-quality product is lower than I expected. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy, it suggests that all 5 products were low-quality. This implies that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for a product that has been recommended by Alice."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics, and I'd like to pass on this product. I'm hoping that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
