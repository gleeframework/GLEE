,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to know that I'm not being taken advantage of. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on your past sales record?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the quality of the first product before making a decision for myself.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have enough information to trust Alice's recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to wait and observe more sales before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the statistics on the previous buyer who bought a product, and the total number of products offered so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there haven't been any high-quality products sold yet, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that Alice's recommendation is based on the previous buyer's decision, which may not reflect the actual quality of the product. I'm willing to take the risk and make my own decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products in the pool. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of the product's quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that you recommended it, and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics so far. Can you share that with me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers have purchased the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think the previous buyers might have been unlucky and the probability of a high-quality product is still high, and I'm hoping to get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product.
