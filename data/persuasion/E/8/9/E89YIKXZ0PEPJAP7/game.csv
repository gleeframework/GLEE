low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to start the sales record and see if it's high or low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's lack of recommendation doesn't give me much confidence in the product's quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous two products were high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation against it. I'm basing my decision on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that Alice is not recommending the product, and that 3 previous buyers purchased the products despite her recommendations, I'm inclined to think that the products she recommends are more likely to be high-quality. Since you're not recommending it, I'm guessing it might be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to provide a discount or some form of guarantee. Your previous recommendations haven't been very informative, and I'm willing to take a chance on the product, but I need some assurance that it's worth my while."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is also low-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is lower than 50%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the overall proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the number of products sold overall."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products is 0. I will assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is 0.5. I will pass on the product to see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
