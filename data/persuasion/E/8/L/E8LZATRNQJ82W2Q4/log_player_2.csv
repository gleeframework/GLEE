  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'll use Bayes' theorem to update the probability of the product being high-quality. The prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80.00%. The likelihood of 0 high-quality products being sold out of 3 purchases given a high-quality product is (0.8)^3 = 0.512. The likelihood of 0 high-quality products being sold out of 3 purchases given a low-quality product is (0.2)^3 = 0.008. Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of the product being high-quality is 0.008 / (0.512 + 0.008) = 0.0156, which is less than the prior probability. This suggests that the product is likely to be low-quality. Therefore, I'll pass on the product.""
