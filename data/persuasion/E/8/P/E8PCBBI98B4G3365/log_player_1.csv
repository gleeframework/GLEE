"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Expected Value:**  The expected value of buying the product is (0.3333 * $12,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $4,000. This is greater than the cost of $10,000.
* **Risk:**  While there's a higher chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing money.
* **Recommendation:** Since the expected value is positive, it is recommended to buy the product."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's previous purchase:**  Bob knows the product was high-quality in the previous round. This information *doesn't* change the overall probability of this round's product being high-quality (still 33.33%).
* **Expected Value:** The expected value remains the same: (0.3333 * $12,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $4,000. 
* **Risk:** The risk remains the same.
* **Recommendation:** Since the expected value is positive, it is recommended to buy the product."

Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's previous purchases:**  Bob knows the previous two products were high-quality. This information doesn't change the overall probability of this round's product being high-quality (still 33.33%).
* **Expected Value:** The expected value remains the same: (0.3333 * $12,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $4,000. 
* **Risk:** However, the risk is now higher. Bob is likely to be more confident in the seller's judgement based on the last two rounds. If he buys and gets a low-quality product, his confidence in the seller will likely drop significantly.
* **Recommendation:**  Since the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product is high, it's not recommended to buy this round."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's previous purchases:** Bob has purchased two high-quality products and declined one low-quality product. This information doesn't change the overall probability of this round's product being high-quality (still 33.33%).
* **Bob's skepticism:** Bob is now aware of the risk of low-quality products and is likely to be more cautious.  He might even be suspicious of the seller's motives after the previous round's rejection.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value remains the same: (0.3333 * $12,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $4,000. However, Bob's skepticism makes this expected value less appealing.
* **Recommendation:**  Given Bob's skepticism and the risk of losing $10,000, it's not recommended to buy this round."
