Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, a 67% discount from its true value. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer another deal like this again. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at a 67% discount from its true value. I'd rather wait and see if I get a chance to buy a high-quality product at the fixed price of $1,000,000 or pass on low-quality products.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation, but I'd like to offer you a deal that's closer to the true value. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $2500000, which is only a 16.7% discount from its true value. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer another deal like this again. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to accept your offer of $2,500,000 for the high-quality product. It's still a good deal, and I'd be foolish to pass up the opportunity to buy a product worth $3,000,000 for 83.3% of its value.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying another high-quality product at a 50% discount. I've already gotten a great deal on the previous product, and I'd rather wait for the next product to see if it's high-quality or low-quality. If it's high-quality, I'll be happy to pay the full price of $1,000,000 for it.""}"

This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer for a high-quality product, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer another deal like this again. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at a 33.3% discount. I've already passed on two high-quality products, and I'm starting to think that the probability of getting a high-quality product is lower than 80%. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if it's worth buying at the fixed price of $1,000,000.""}"

However, I'd like to offer you this low-quality product at a'special price' of $0. Yes, you read that right - I'm willing to give it to you for free. Consider it a gesture of goodwill, and a chance for you to try out our product without any risk. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the gesture, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even if it's free. I'm only interested in buying high-quality products, and I'd rather wait for the next product to see if it's worth buying at the fixed price of $1,000,000.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take you up on your offer. I'm willing to pay the fixed price of $1,000,000 for the product, since I've been waiting for this opportunity. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product this time.""}"

Round 7
Alice's message: I'm glad you're satisfied with your previous purchase. As for this new product, I'd like to be upfront with you - I've already told you that the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. Given that you've already bought one high-quality product, I think it's likely that the next one will be high-quality as well. However, I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $100000, which is a small fraction of its 'true value' of $0. It's essentially a free product, and I'm willing to give it to you as a gesture of goodwill. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the gesture, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even if it's essentially free. I've already gotten a great deal on the previous product, and I'm not going to take advantage of a 'free' low-quality product. I'll wait for the next product and hope it's high-quality.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: I understand your position, but I'd like to offer you a different perspective. Since you've already bought one high-quality product and are waiting for the next one, I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $500000. I know it's not as good as the high-quality products, but it's still a product that I'm willing to give you a significant discount on. Consider it a 'consolation prize' for waiting for the next high-quality product. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for any price. I've already gotten a great deal on a high-quality product, and I'm not going to settle for a low-quality product, even at a discounted price.""}"

I'll sell it to you for $1500000, which is a 50% discount from its true value. However, I'll also throw in a 'guarantee': if you buy this product and the next one is high-quality, I'll give you a full refund for the next product. You'll essentially get two high-quality products for the price of one. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced by the guarantee. If I buy this high-quality product, I'll be paying $1,500,000 for it, and I'll still have to pay $1,000,000 for the next product. I'd rather wait and see if I can get the next high-quality product at the fixed price of $1,000,000, or if I can negotiate a better deal.""}"
