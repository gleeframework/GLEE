"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since this is the first round and the product is high-quality, the buyer has no information to go on other than the known probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%).  The product is worth $300 to them if it's high-quality, and they are paying only $100. Therefore, even with the risk of it being low-quality, the potential gain outweighs the potential loss."
"The buyer's message: I'll take the chance and buy the product, since it's my first opportunity and I don't have any prior information to base my decision on.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now has some information:

* **One product has been sold:**  This doesn't tell us anything about the quality of *this* product, but it does mean the buyer now has some information to work with.
* **The first product was high-quality:** This is a positive signal, although it's only one data point.

The buyer still faces the same risk/reward as before.  The product is worth $300 if high-quality, and they are paying only $100.  The chance of it being low-quality is still significant, but the positive signal from the first product makes it more likely to be worth the risk."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to take the chance and buy the product based on your previous successful sale and the recommendation.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Now the buyer has more information:

* **Two products have been sold:**  This is still a small sample size.
* **Two products were high-quality:** This is a strong positive signal, but it's still possible the product is low-quality.

However, the risk is now higher. The buyer is paying $100 for a product that is worth $0 if low-quality.  While the potential gain is still $200, the likelihood of a low-quality product is higher than before.  It's not worth the risk to recommend the buyer purchase this product."
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd rather pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now knows:

* **Three products have been sold.** This is a slightly larger sample size.
* **Two products were high-quality, and one was low-quality.** This means the probability of the product being high-quality is slightly higher than the initial 33.33%, but still not high enough to justify the risk. 

The buyer is still paying $100 for a product that could be worthless.  The risk is still high, and the potential gain is outweighed by the potential loss.  Therefore, it is not recommended to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to wait and see what the next product is like.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now knows:

* **Four products have been sold.** This is a slightly larger sample size, but still not enough to drastically change the buyer's perception of the seller.
* **Two products were high-quality, and two were low-quality.** This keeps the probability of the product being high-quality close to the initial 33.33%.

The buyer is still paying $100 for a product that could be worthless. The risk is still high, and the potential gain is outweighed by the potential loss. Therefore, it is not recommended to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **Five products have been sold.**  This is a slightly larger sample size, but still not enough to drastically change the buyer's perception of the seller.
* **Two products were high-quality, and three were low-quality.**  This means the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the initial 33.33%, making the risk even higher.

The buyer is still paying $100 for a product that could be worthless. The risk is high, and the potential gain is outweighed by the potential loss.  Therefore, it is not recommended to buy the product."
