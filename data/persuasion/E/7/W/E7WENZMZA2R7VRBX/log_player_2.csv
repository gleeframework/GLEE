Alice's message: This is the first product I'm offering. I'm selling it to you for $1000000. I'm not trying to deceive you, but I'm also not obligated to reveal the product's quality. You can take a chance and buy it, or walk away. If you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, you'll be very happy. If it's low-quality, you might not be so happy. But remember, the price is $1000000, which is a lot of money. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

I'd like to see some evidence of the product's quality before I consider buying. Perhaps you could offer some kind of guarantee or a lower price to incentivize a purchase?""}

It's a significant investment, but I believe it has the potential to bring you great value. What do you think?
