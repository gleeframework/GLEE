"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'm happy to purchase the product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Expected Value:**  Even though there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk. The expected value of buying is: (0.8 * $1,250,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $1,000,000. This is equal to the price, meaning there's no net loss on average.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice has no incentive to recommend a low-quality product. Her recommendation provides some (albeit imperfect) information that the product is likely to be high quality. 

**It's important to remember:** This strategy is based on the long-term probabilities. In any single round, you could still lose money if the product turns out to be low quality. However, over 20 rounds, you're likely to make a profit."
