Alice's message: I understand your concerns and appreciate your diligence in seeking more information. The sales process is as follows: I have a pool of products, and each round, I randomly select a product from the pool. The probability of a product being high-quality or low-quality is based on the overall distribution of products in the pool. In this case, the pool has a 80% high-quality product distribution and a 20% low-quality product distribution. The 2 low-quality products sold out of 5 were simply a result of the random selection process. I'm excited to offer you this high-quality product for $1000000.
