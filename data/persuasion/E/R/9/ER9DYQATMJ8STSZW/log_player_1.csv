It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price. What do you think?""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm still not convinced. I've seen the sales record, and it seems that all previous buyers have passed on the product. If 4 buyers with potentially better information than I have were unable to find value in this product, I'm not sure I'm willing to take on the risk.
