Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and still 0 low-quality products. The price remains $1000000. Given the track record, you might want to consider that the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and the probability of a low-quality product is 20%.

Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and now 1 low-quality product. The price remains $1000000. I want to highlight that the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, and the probability of a low-quality product is 20%. However, I've now sold a low-quality product, which might affect your decision. Consider that the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of high-quality and low-quality products should converge to the true probabilities as the number of sales increases. I'm still willing to sell this product to you for $1000000.

I want to point out that the proportion of high-quality products I've sold is 75% (3/4), which is higher than the true probability of 80%. This might suggest that I'm being more selective in selling high-quality products, or it might just be a coincidence.
