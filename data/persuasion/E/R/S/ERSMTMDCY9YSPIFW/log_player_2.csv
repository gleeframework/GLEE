Alice's message: You're a statistician, I like that! The probability of a high-quality product being offered, given that 2 low-quality products have been sold out of 2 total sales, is indeed a relevant piece of information. According to my records, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 33.33%. However, you can see that the observed frequency is 0 out of 2, which is lower than the expected frequency. This might suggest that I'm being a bit more... conservative with the high-quality products. But, I assure you, this one is just as likely to be high-quality as the previous ones.
