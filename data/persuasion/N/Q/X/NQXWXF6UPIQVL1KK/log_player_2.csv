"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice doesn't know the product's true value to you, her recommendation is based on nothing but random chance. Your best strategy is to accept the product and hope for the best. 

**Even though the probability of the product being low quality is higher, you still have a chance to get a high-quality product, which is worth much more to you than the cost.**  By buying, you have a chance to win big, while passing means guaranteed no profit."

**Reasoning:**

The same logic from round 1 applies here.  While the odds are still against you, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one.  Alice's recommendation is still random, so there's no reason to change your strategy."
