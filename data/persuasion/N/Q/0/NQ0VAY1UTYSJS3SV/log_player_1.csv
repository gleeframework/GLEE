```"
"Bob's message: Alice, while the guarantee is a step in the right direction, it still doesn't address my main concern. I need to understand the product's value proposition and how it justifies the $1000000 price tag. A refund guarantee doesn't provide enough information for me to make a well-informed decision.

Would you be interested in this partnership?""}
```"
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the profit-sharing offer, but it still doesn't address my core concern. I need to understand the product's value proposition and how it generates profit. Without more information about the product itself, I can't assess its potential and make an informed decision.

"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hesitant.  While the guarantee is a step in the right direction,  'solving a common problem' is vague.
