,,Bob,2,"Alice, I appreciate your continued interest, but I still need more concrete information before I can commit.

,,Alice,3,"Bob, I understand your need for concrete information.  While I can't disclose specific details due to confidentiality agreements, I'm confident that the product's potential is substantial.

,,Bob,4,"Alice, while the guarantee is a step in the right direction, it still doesn't address my main concern.
