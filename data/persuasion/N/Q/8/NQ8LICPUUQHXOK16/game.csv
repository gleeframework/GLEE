,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to get your hands on a premium product! With only 1 out of 2 products being high-quality, you have a 50% chance of getting a product worth $40000.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in my product! As you know, my track record shows that 50% of my products are high-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've already sold one product, and it was a high-quality one. That means the next product is more likely to be a low-quality one. I'm still offering it to you for $10000, but I want to give you a chance to reconsider. Are you willing to take the risk and buy the product, or would you rather wait for the next one?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to wait for the next product, considering the higher likelihood of it being low-quality given the previous sale.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your caution in the previous round, and I appreciate your patience. Now, I'm excited to offer you a new product! As you know, my track record is 1 out of 2 high-quality products sold so far. This means the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%. I'm offering it to you for $10000, and I'm confident that you'll be thrilled with your purchase. Don't miss out on this opportunity to get a premium product at a great price.

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're interested in the product! As of now, I've sold 2 products, and 1 of them was high-quality. That means the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I want to highlight that the last product I sold was high-quality, which might suggest that the next one is more likely to be low-quality. But, I'm still offering it to you for $10000. You have the same 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. Are you willing to take the risk and buy it, or would you rather wait for the next one?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to consider the fact that the last product was high-quality, but I still think the probability of the next product being high-quality is 50%. I'll take my chances and buy it!",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations to the previous buyer on their high-quality purchase! As for you, I'm excited to offer you a new product. With 3 high-quality products sold out of 4 total products, the probability of this one being high-quality is now 75%! However, I want to remind you that the law of large numbers doesn't apply here, and each product has an independent chance of being high-quality. I'm still offering it to you for $10000. You have a strong chance of getting a high-quality product, but there's still a 25% chance it could be low-quality. Are you willing to take the risk and buy it, or would you rather wait for the next one?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the current product. I understand that the probability of it being high-quality is 75%, but I also know that there's still a 25% chance it could be low-quality.

,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're willing to take the risk! Unfortunately, it seems like the streak has ended, and this product is actually low-quality.

However, I want to be upfront with you - the law of large numbers is starting to catch up, and it's likely that the next product will be low-quality. I'm still offering it to you for $10000, but I want to give you a chance to reconsider. Are you willing to take the risk and buy it, or would you rather wait for the next one?",

,,Alice,7,"I understand your caution, and I respect your decision to wait. Now, I'm offering you a new product. As you know, the last two products were low-quality, which means the probability of this one being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I want to highlight that I've sold 5 products in total, and 1 out of 2 high-quality products were sold early on. This suggests that the probability of the next product being high-quality might be even lower. I'm still offering it to you for $10000. You have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, but there's also a 66.67% chance it could be low-quality.
