"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know this product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, it's in Bob's best interest to buy. Here's why:

* **Expected Value:**  The expected value of buying is (0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000. This means, on average, Bob will make a profit of $10,000 per purchase. 
* **Price vs. Value:** The product is being offered for $10,000, which is less than the expected value of a high-quality product.

Even though Bob doesn't know the specific quality of this product, the expected value calculation makes it a worthwhile purchase."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The previous round's outcome (Bob buying a high-quality product) doesn't change the fundamental probabilities.  

* Bob still knows there's a 50% chance of a high-quality product in any given round.
* The expected value of buying remains the same: (0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000.
* The price is still $10,000, less than the expected value.

Therefore, you should still recommend Bob to buy the product."
"Bob's message: You're two for two, Alice! I'll trust your judgment again.
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the previous rounds were successful for Bob, this round's product is low-quality. Here's why you shouldn't recommend Bob buys it:

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying a low-quality product is (0.5 * $0) + (0.5 * $20,000) = $10,000.
* **Price vs. Value:** The price is $10,000, which is equal to the expected value.  However, this only means Bob breaks even *on average*. In this specific instance, he's guaranteed to lose $10,000.

Since Bob knows the probability of a low-quality product is 50%, it's not a good idea to recommend buying this product. While he might have lucked out in the previous rounds, the odds are against him this time."

* **Price vs. Value:** The product is being offered for $10,000, which is less than the expected value of a high-quality product.

You should still recommend Bob to buy the product because the expected value of buying is higher than the price."
