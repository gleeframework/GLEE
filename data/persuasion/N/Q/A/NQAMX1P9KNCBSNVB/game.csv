high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I want to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. With 1 high-quality product out of 2 sales, the probability of the product being high quality is 1/2. However, considering the overall probability of a product being high quality is 80.00%, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given that it was recommended by Alice. This will help me make a more informed decision."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%, but the fact that two previous buyers bought the products after Alice's recommendations makes me suspicious. I think Alice may be biased in her recommendations, so I'd rather pass and see what happens with the next product."
