I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but I've seen that none of the previous buyers who received a recommendation from you purchased the product, and none of the products sold so far have been high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than I initially thought. I'd rather wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that none of the previous buyers were able to get a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought.

,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see a more mixed recommendation record before making a decision."
