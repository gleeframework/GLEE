This is still a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. Are you willing to take advantage of this rare opportunity?""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's quality, but I'm concerned that the low sales rate of high-quality products (0/3) suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products being sold.
