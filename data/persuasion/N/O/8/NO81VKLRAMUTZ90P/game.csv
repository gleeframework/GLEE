,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and the worst-case scenario is that I get a low-quality product worth $0 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, the probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33%.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, I'm surprised that 3 buyers have passed on the products despite Alice's recommendations. This suggests that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product as well."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. Additionally, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers passed on the products, I'm starting to suspect that the products might be low quality. Is there any information that led you to advise me to pass on this product?"

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 33.33%. I'll wait for a better opportunity."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendations, I'm suspicious that the products may be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics and Alice's recommendation. I'm aware that 0 high-quality products have been sold, which suggests a higher likelihood of the product being low-quality. However, I'd like to take the risk and buy it, as the potential reward is high ($30000). I'm also curious to see if I'll be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm going to assume the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
