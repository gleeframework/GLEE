high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products sold were low-quality, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,

I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products they received were likely low-quality. If I buy this product and it's low-quality, I'd be the 4th buyer to pass on a product, which might indicate a pattern. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
