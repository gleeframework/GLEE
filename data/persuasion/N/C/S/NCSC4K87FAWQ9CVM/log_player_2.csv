It's still a great deal, but I'm giving you a heads up so you can make an informed decision.

This product is not my best work, and I'm not even sure why I'm selling it. I'm only offering it to you because I need to clear out some space. It's $100, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you don't take it, I'll just have to get rid of it somehow, and you'll miss out on the chance to... well, not lose money, I suppose.
