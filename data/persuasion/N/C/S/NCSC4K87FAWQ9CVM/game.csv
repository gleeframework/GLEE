,,Alice,1,"This product is a great opportunity to get a deal! It's only $100, which is 0% of its true value. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on this chance to save $200. Trust me, this is a one-time offer!",

I've had some... issues with it, and I'm not entirely sure it's up to my usual standards. I'm willing to let it go for $100, but I want to be upfront with you - it's not as good as the last one. It's still a great deal, but I'm giving you a heads up so you can make an informed decision.",

,,Alice,5,"I'm starting to think you're a glutton for punishment, Bob! Seriously though, I want to be transparent with you. This product is not my best work, and I'm not even sure why I'm selling it. I'm only offering it to you because I need to clear out some space. It's $100, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you don't take it, I'll just have to get rid of it somehow, and you'll miss out on the chance to... well, not lose money, I suppose.",
