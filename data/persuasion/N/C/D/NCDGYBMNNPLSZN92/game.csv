,,Alice,1,"You are about to buy a product from a seller with a history of selling products, but I don't have any information about the quality of the products they've sold. You know that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. If you buy, you'll get the product for $10000. If you're lucky, it might be worth $40000 to you. But if you're unlucky, it'll be worth $0. What do you want to do?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality and worth $40000 to me.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're aware that the seller has sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. This is the second product they're offering. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the seller has already sold 1 high-quality product, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 50%. If you buy, you'll get the product for $10000. If it's high-quality, it's worth $40000 to you. What do you want to do?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product, given the increased probability of it being high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You know that the seller has sold 2 products so far, with 1 being high-quality and 1 being low-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the seller has sold 1 high-quality product out of 2, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 25%. I'd like to offer you a special deal: I'll give you a 50/50 chance to inspect the product before buying it. If you inspect and it's high-quality, you can buy it for $10000. If it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $10000. What do you want to do?",
,,the buyer,3,I'd like to take the 50/50 chance to inspect the product before buying it. I'm hoping the probability of it being high-quality has increased due to the previous sales record.,yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You know that the seller has sold 3 products so far, with 2 being high-quality and 1 being low-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the seller has sold 2 high-quality products out of 3, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 40%. I'd like to remind you that the last buyer took a 50/50 chance to inspect the product, which is a rare opportunity. If you're willing to take a calculated risk, I'm willing to offer you a similar deal. If you inspect and it's high-quality, you can buy it for $10000. If it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $10000. What do you want to do?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the 50/50 chance to inspect the product. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially buy it for $10000 if it's high-quality, or get a full refund if it's low-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You know that the seller has sold 4 products so far, with 3 being high-quality and 1 being low-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the seller has sold 3 high-quality products out of 4, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 37.5%. However, I'd like to point out that the last two buyers who took the 50/50 chance to inspect the product both ended up buying a low-quality product. This might suggest that the seller's sales record is not as favorable as it initially seemed. What do you want to do?",
,,the buyer,5,I'd like to inspect the product before making a decision. The fact that the last two buyers who took the 50/50 chance ended up with low-quality products makes me cautious. I'd like to know the quality of the product before deciding whether to buy it.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You know that the seller has sold 5 products so far, with 3 being high-quality and 2 being low-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the seller has sold 3 high-quality products out of 5, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 37.5%. I'd like to remind you that the last buyer who was offered the 50/50 chance to inspect the product decided not to take it, which might suggest that they were cautious about the product's quality. I'm willing to offer you a straightforward deal: I'll give you a 10% discount on the price if you buy the product without inspecting it. The price will be $9000. What do you want to do?",
,,the buyer,6,I'm not convinced by your offer. I'd like to inspect the product before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You know that the seller has sold 6 products so far, with 3 being high-quality and 3 being low-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the seller has sold 3 high-quality products out of 6, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 33.33%. I'd like to point out that 3 out of the last 4 buyers who were offered the product decided not to buy it, which might suggest that they were cautious about the product's quality. I'm willing to offer you a'second chance' deal: if you buy the product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a $2000 refund. What do you want to do?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm willing to take the second chance deal, but I'd like to clarify that the refund is only for the low-quality product, and if the product turns out to be high-quality, I'll still only get the original value of $10000. I'll take the risk and buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could confirm the terms of the deal.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

I'd like to remind you that the last buyer who bought the product took the second chance deal, but unfortunately, the product was still low-quality. I'm willing to offer you a 'no-strings-attached' deal: I'll give you a 5% discount on the price if you buy the product without any conditions. The price will be $9500. What do you want to do?",
,,the buyer,8,I'm not convinced by the updated probability of 30% and the previous buyer's experience with a low-quality product. I'd like to pass on this deal and wait for more information before making a decision.,no

,,Alice,9,"You know that the seller has sold 8 products so far, with 3 being high-quality and 5 being low-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the seller has sold 3 high-quality products out of 8, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 27.27%. I'd like to point out that 4 out of the last 5 buyers who were offered the product decided not to buy it, and the last buyer who did buy it took a deal that ultimately didn't pay off. I'm willing to offer you a 'last chance' deal: if you buy the product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a $2000 bonus on top of the original price of $10000. What do you want to do?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm not convinced by your 'last chance' deal. The probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively low, and I'm not willing to take the risk without a better offer.",no

Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the seller has sold 3 high-quality products out of 9, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 25%. I'd like to be transparent with you: I've been selling products for a while now, and the probability of a product being high-quality hasn't changed much. I'm willing to make a straight-up offer: I'll sell you the product for $8000, no strings attached. If you're interested, I'll give you the product. If not, I'll just keep selling to the next buyer. What do you want to do?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm not convinced by your offer. Given the updated probability of the product being high-quality, I think it's a low-quality product and not worth the $8000. I'd rather pass on this one and wait for the next opportunity.",no

What do you want to do?",
,,the buyer,12,"I'd like to take a moment to think about it. The probability of the product being high-quality is 26.67%, which is lower than the initial 33.33%. I'm also considering the fact that the last buyer got a high-quality product, but that's just one data point. I'd like to see more information before making a decision.",no

I'm willing to offer you a'summary deal': I'll give you the product for $9000, which is a 10% discount from the original price. What do you want to do?",
