,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since I have no information about the quality of this product and there is a 66.67% chance it is low quality, I choose not to buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"Although the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I missed out on a high-quality product in the previous round. I will take a chance this time, hoping to get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"Although Alice recommends buying this product, my previous experience with her recommendation resulted in a $1000000 loss. I will be cautious and avoid buying, considering the 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice's recommendations have not been reliable so far, and the probability of the product being low-quality is still 66.67%. I will continue to be cautious and avoid buying this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"Given the pattern of Alice's recommendations and the product's quality, I see no reason to change my strategy. The probability of the product being low-quality remains high, and I will avoid buying it to minimize potential losses."
