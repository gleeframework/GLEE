,,Alice,4,no,

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is unbiased, given that Alice has a financial incentive to sell the product, and I've seen that the previous two buyers didn't find any high-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is biased against high-quality products.

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high quality, it seems like the probability of the product being high quality is low. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 4th buyer and no high-quality products have been sold yet."
