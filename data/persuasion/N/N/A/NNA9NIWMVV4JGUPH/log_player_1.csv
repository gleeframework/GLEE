}"
"Bob's message: I'm not sure what's going on here, but I think you're trying to sell me two high-quality products in a row. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, the probability of two high-quality products in a row is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64. I'm not convinced that this is a fair offer, and I'd like to pass on this one.

}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in buying a lottery ticket. The expected value of this product is still just $960000 (0.8 * $1200000 + 0.2 * $0 = $960000), and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for it. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with this high-quality product. What do you think?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and even if it is, the expected value is still $960000, not $1200000. I'm not willing to pay $900000 for a product that might be worth $960000 to me. I'll pass on this one.

I'm essentially giving it away at this point, and I'm willing to let it go for a fraction of its original value. I'm not making a profit on this one, and I'm only looking to recoup some of the costs.

The total price for both products is still $900000, and I'm confident that you'll be thrilled with the value you're getting.""
