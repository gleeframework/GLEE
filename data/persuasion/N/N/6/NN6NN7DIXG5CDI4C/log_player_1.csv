Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

This is the first time you have a low-quality product. While you don't know how much a low-quality product is worth to Bob, you can't guarantee he will find it valuable.

It's best to withhold the recommendation for this round and see if Bob develops a pattern of making decisions based on the quality of the products rather than your recommendations."

However, he hasn't shown any pattern of making decisions based solely on the quality of the product (as you don't know the worth of a low-quality product to him). It's still likely that this high-quality product is worth more than the price to him. You should continue to recommend it, but be prepared to adjust your strategy in future rounds if he continues to be more independent in his decisions."
