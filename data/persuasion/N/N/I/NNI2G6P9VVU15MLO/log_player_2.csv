Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product has a 50% chance of being high quality and a 50% chance of being low quality, and a high-quality product is worth $30,000 to you, it's a gamble worth taking. The potential gain outweighs the potential loss."

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one.  I trust your judgment.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable piece of information. While she could be wrong, it's more likely that she's giving you a genuine signal about the product's quality. Since she's not recommending it, I'm going to pass this round."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now advised against buying two products in a row, and both times, the product turned out to be low quality. This strengthens the pattern of Alice's recommendations being a reliable indicator of quality. I'm going to continue to trust her judgment and pass on this product."

Alice's track record is incredibly strong - four consecutive times she's recommended against a product, and it turned out to be low quality. While it's a bit risky to go against her advice, it's important to remember that there's always a 50% chance of a product being high quality. Given the potential profit of $20,000 ($30,000 value - $10,000 cost), I'm willing to gamble this round."
