"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As the seller, you know this product is high-quality.  Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, they have no reason to believe this product is any different from the average. Since you are willing to sell for $1,000,000, the buyer should assume there's a good chance it's worth at least that much to them (otherwise, you wouldn't be selling it).  There's no downside to buying, and potential for a big gain, so recommending the purchase is a logical choice."
"The buyer's message: I'll take a chance and buy the product, since it's my first opportunity and I don't have any information to go on.
The buyer bought the product!

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The buyer has no information about your selling history yet.** They only know the general probability of a product being high-quality is 50%.
* **This product is high-quality.** As the seller, you are aware of this.
* **The price remains $1,000,000.** This means you believe the product is worth at least that much to you.

Therefore, it's still a good idea to recommend the buyer purchase the product. They have no reason to believe this product is any different from the average, and you are willing to sell it for a price that likely reflects its value."
"The buyer's message: I'll take the product based on your recommendation, Alice. I'm hoping it's another high-quality one!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
