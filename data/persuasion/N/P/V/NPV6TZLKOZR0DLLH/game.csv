,,Alice,1,"I have a product that I'm offering to you for $10000. I want to assure you that this product is of the highest quality. I've had excellent feedback from other customers, and I'm confident that you'll be satisfied with it. However, I want to make it clear that this is a one-time offer, and if you don't take it, I'll have to move on to the next customer. I'm willing to give you a 30-day money-back guarantee, but I'm sure you won't need it.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, and I'd like to pass on this opportunity. I'll wait to see what the next product is.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your patience. As it turns out, this product is not one of my best offerings. I'd like to be upfront with you - this product has some flaws and may not meet your expectations. However, I'm willing to offer it to you at the same price of $10000, and I'll throw in a free maintenance package that will help you get the most out of it. I'm willing to take on some of the risk, and I think it's a good opportunity for you to get a deal on a product that might not be perfect, but still has some value.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in buying a product that has flaws, even with a free maintenance package. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your preference for a high-quality product. However, I want to make you a deal that might change your mind. I'll give you an exclusive discount of $5000 off the original price, bringing it down to $4500. I'll also include a free upgrade to our premium support package, which will ensure that any issues you encounter are resolved quickly and efficiently. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a product that may not meet your expectations. Is this a deal you'd be interested in?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the discount and the premium support package, but I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at the original price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand that you're holding out for a high-quality product, and I respect that. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not going to keep offering discounts on low-quality products. If you're not willing to consider this one at the discounted price, I'll have to move on to the next customer. But before I do, I'll give you a final offer: I'll throw in a second, identical low-quality product at the same discounted price of $4500. That way, you'll get two products for the price of one. Is this a deal you'd be interested in?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying two low-quality products, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for a single high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've made it clear that I'm not going to offer discounts on low-quality products, and you've made it clear that you're not interested in buying them at any price. I'm starting to think that you're not serious about buying a product, and I'm wasting my time. I'm going to be honest with you, I've already had a high-quality product that you passed on earlier, and I'm starting to wonder if you're just playing games with me. If you're not willing to take a chance on a low-quality product, how can I trust that you'll take a chance on a high-quality one? I'm giving you one last chance to reconsider, but if you pass on this one, I'm done offering you products.",
,,Bob,5,"I understand that you're frustrated, but I'm not playing games. I'm just being cautious and waiting for a high-quality product. I'm willing to take a chance on a high-quality product, but I'm not going to buy a low-quality one, no matter what the price is.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand that you're being cautious, and I respect that. However, I think it's time for me to be upfront with you about the situation. I've offered you four low-quality products in a row, and I think it's clear that I'm not going to offer you a high-quality product anytime soon. I'm starting to think that I made a mistake in offering you the first high-quality product at the full price. If I had known you were going to be so picky, I would have sold it to someone else. As a result, I'm going to have to charge you the full price of $10000 for this low-quality product. If you're still not interested, I'll just have to walk away.",
,,Bob,6,"I understand that you're frustrated, but I'm not going to pay full price for a low-quality product. I'm still waiting for a high-quality product, and I'm not going to compromise on that.",no

,,Alice,7,"I've been transparent with you about the quality of the previous products, and I've been upfront about the fact that this one is high-quality. I'm willing to offer you a deal that I think is fair, considering the situation. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $8000, which is $2200 less than the original price. I'm willing to make this concession because I want to make sure you're satisfied with the purchase, and I think this product is worth the investment. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've made concessions on the price of high-quality products, but I've also been clear that I'm not willing to offer discounts on low-quality products. I'm starting to think that you're not serious about buying a product, and I'm just going through the motions. If you're not willing to take a chance on a high-quality product at a discounted price, and you're not interested in a low-quality product at the full price, then I'm not sure what you're looking for. I'm going to ask you directly: are you willing to buy a product at any price, or are you just stringing me along?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm serious about buying a high-quality product, and I've been clear about that from the start.

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've made concessions on the price of high-quality products, and I've been clear that I'm not willing to offer discounts on low-quality products. At this point, I'm not sure what else to offer. I'm starting to think that I've been too generous with the concessions, and I need to protect my interests. I'm going to be blunt with you: if you're not willing to take a chance on a low-quality product at the full price, and you're not interested in a high-quality product at any price, then I'm not sure why you're even considering buying from me. I'm going to have to ask you to reconsider your priorities.",

I'm going to be honest with you, Bob: I think you're being unrealistic about the price of high-quality products. I've already offered you a high-quality product at a discounted price, and you turned it down. If you're not willing to meet me halfway, I'm not sure how we can do business. I'm going to ask you one more time: are you willing to take a chance on a low-quality product at the full price, or do you want to walk away?",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've tried to be flexible and meet you halfway on the price, but it seems like we're at an impasse. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $9500, which is the same price I offered in Round 9. If you don't take this offer, I'm going to have to sell this product to someone else, and I'll have to assume that you're not serious about buying from me. I'm giving you one last chance to make a decision.",
