,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to take you up on the 5-minute inspection offer. I've reviewed the statistics, and the fact that 2 out of 3 products sold have been high-quality suggests a high probability of this product being high-quality as well.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,

I'm confident that this new system will catch any potential issues before they reach the customer. I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 8 so far, and I'm eager to make another sale.

I'd be happy to provide you with the product ID and link to track the product's history and status in real-time, as I mentioned earlier. I'll also give you a 15% refund guarantee, in addition to the 10% refund guarantee I previously offered. This way, you'll have even more protection and peace of mind. The price remains $10000.",
,,the buyer,9,"I appreciate your efforts to improve quality control, and I'm willing to take the risk given the improved guarantees.

I've taken several steps to address the issue, including re-training our quality control team, implementing additional quality checks, and increasing the number of inspections before shipping.
