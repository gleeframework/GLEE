"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is low-quality, and Bob knows that 50% of products are low-quality, there's no reason to recommend buying it.  Bob is likely to assume it's a low-quality product and won't buy it at the high price."
"Bob's message: I'm not buying this one, thanks!
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies as in Round 1.  You know the product is low-quality, and Bob has already demonstrated that he's unwilling to buy products without additional information or assurances. There's no reason to believe he'll change his mind this round."

Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time you have a high-quality product.  While Bob has rejected the previous two products, this one is different. You should recommend buying it because:

* **Bob is risk-averse:** He's likely to be cautious and hesitant due to the high price and the 50% chance of a low-quality product. 
* **You have a high-quality product:** This is a rare opportunity for Bob to get a valuable product.
* **He knows the price is fixed:** He has no incentive to wait for a potential discount or ""better deal"" later, as there won't be one.

By recommending the purchase, you're appealing to Bob's risk aversion while also highlighting the unique value of this specific product."

* **High-quality product:** This is what Bob wants and is likely to be very valuable to him.
* **Opportunity to rebuild trust:** Bob is hesitant due to past experiences. Recommending a high-quality product shows you're acting in his best interest and can demonstrate your reliability.
