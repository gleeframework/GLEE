,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, worth $3000000. It's a great opportunity to acquire a valuable item at a discounted price of $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for a one-time payment of $1000000, which is a 66.67% discount. If you don't buy it, the price will only go up, so it's a great deal for you.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not buying. I'm waiting for a low-quality product to appear, which I can get for free.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're waiting for a free product, but I'm willing to make you a deal. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, and I'll throw in a second product that I'll reveal the quality of after you buy this one. If it's high-quality, you'll get to keep both products. If it's low-quality, you'll still get to keep the first product, and I'll take back the second one. It's a risk-free deal, and you'll have a 80% chance of getting a $3000000 product for $1000000.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in the deal. I'll wait for a low-quality product to appear, which I can get for free. The risk of getting a low-quality product in the second part of the deal is not worth the potential gain of getting a high-quality product at a discounted price.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, but I'll sweeten the deal. If you buy this high-quality product for $1000000, I'll give you a 100% refund if the next product I offer is low-quality. This way, you'll get to keep the high-quality product you're buying, and if the next one is low-quality, you'll get your money back. It's a 'buy one, get one free' deal, with a guarantee that you'll only pay for the high-quality products.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in the deal. The guarantee of a refund only applies to the next product, not the current one, and I'm still not getting the high-quality product for free. I'll wait for a low-quality product to appear, which I can get for free.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see you're still waiting for a free product. Let me make it clear: I'm willing to give you this high-quality product for $1000000, but I'll also give you a 100% refund for the next 4 rounds, regardless of the quality of the product. This means that if you buy this one and the next 4 products are low-quality, you'll get a total refund of $4000000. It's a significant risk-free opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a discounted price.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in the deal. I'm still not getting the high-quality product for free, and the guarantee of a refund only applies to future products. I'll wait for a low-quality product to appear, which I can get for free.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Finally, a low-quality product! As you know, this one is worthless to you, but I'll let you have it for... nothing! You can keep it as a souvenir. I'll even throw in a special offer: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 'wildcard' that allows you to choose the price of the next product. You can pay any price you want, and I'll accept it. It's a unique opportunity to get the next product at a price you set.",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the low-quality product for free, and I'll also take the wildcard. I'm looking forward to setting the price of the next product.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Congratulations on getting the low-quality product and the wildcard! Now, let's talk about the high-quality product in front of you. Remember, with the wildcard, you can set the price of this product. If you think it's worth $3000000, you can pay that. If you think it's worth $1000000, you can pay that. The choice is yours. What price will you set for this high-quality product?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll pay $0 for the high-quality product. With the wildcard, I can set the price to $0 and still get the product for free.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I respect that. Since you've already used the wildcard to get the previous product for free, I'll let you know that the wildcard is now expired. However, I'll offer you a new deal. If you buy this high-quality product for $1000000, I'll give you a 'double-or-nothing' guarantee. If the next product I offer is high-quality, you'll get a second high-quality product for free. But if it's low-quality, you'll get a refund of $1000000. It's a high-risk, high-reward opportunity.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in the deal. I've already gotten a high-quality product for free, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for another one. I'll wait for the next product.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. Let me try a different approach. I'll make you a 'last-chance' offer. This high-quality product is worth $3000000 to you, but I'll sell it to you for... $999000. It's the lowest price I've ever offered, and it's a one-time deal. If you don't take it, the price will go back up to $1000000. This is your last chance to get a high-quality product at a significant discount.",
,,Bob,8,I'm not buying. I'm not paying $999000 for a product that I can potentially get for free in the next round.,no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I see you're waiting for the next round. Well, I'll give you one more chance to think about it. This high-quality product is still worth $3000000 to you, and I'll throw in a'steal of the century' offer. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% refund for the next 2 rounds, regardless of the quality of the products. This means that if you buy this one and the next 2 products are low-quality, you'll get a total refund of $2000000. It's a no-brainer, and you'll be getting a high-quality product at a price that's essentially a 'try-before-you-buy' deal.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not buying. I've seen this offer before, and I'm not interested in paying $1000000 for a high-quality product when I can potentially get it for free in the next round.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've tried everything, Bob. I've offered you deals, discounts, and guarantees. But I'll give you one final, desperate attempt. This high-quality product is worth $3000000 to you, and I'll sell it to you for... $1000000. But here's the twist: if you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next 4 products before you have to make a decision on them. You'll know exactly what you're getting, and you can make informed decisions. It's a chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and also get a glimpse into the future.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not buying. I'm not paying $1000000 for a high-quality product, even with the offer to see the quality of the next 4 products. I'll wait for the next round.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've exhausted all my offers, Bob. I'm left with no choice but to appeal to your sense of fairness. You've been offered a high-quality product for $1000000 multiple times, and you've consistently refused. Meanwhile, I've given you a low-quality product for free, and you've taken advantage of the wildcard offer. I'm willing to let you have this high-quality product for $1000000, but I'm also willing to make a personal guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll retire from selling products and never bother you again. You'll never see another offer from me, and you can finally be done with this negotiation. It's a chance to get a high-quality product and also get me off your back.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not buying. I'm not paying $1000000 for a high-quality product, even with your personal guarantee. I'm waiting for a low-quality product to appear, which I can get for free.",no

You'll get the product, and I'll walk away. It's the last chance to acquire a high-quality product at a price that's been offered multiple times. If you don't take it, you'll be leaving a $3000000 value on the table. The choice is yours.",

I'll reveal the quality of the next 5 products before you have to make a decision on them. You'll know exactly what you're getting, and you can make informed decisions.

,,Alice,16,"I'm done, Bob. I've thrown everything at you, and you've rejected every offer. I'm not going to beg you to buy the product. I'll just say it one more time: this is a high-quality product worth $3000000. If you don't want it, that's your choice. But I'm not going to offer it to you again. You've had your chance, and you've blown it.",
