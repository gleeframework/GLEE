high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to take your recommendation into account, but I'll still make my own decision. Since 4 out of 7 products sold were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of the current product being high-quality is around 57.14% (4/7). Given this probability, I'll decide based on the expected value. If the product is high-quality, I'll get a value of $4000000, and if it's low-quality, I'll get a value of $0. The expected value is therefore ($4000000 * 0.5714) + ($0 * 0.4286) = $2285714. Since this is greater than the price of $1000000, I'll decide to buy the product."
