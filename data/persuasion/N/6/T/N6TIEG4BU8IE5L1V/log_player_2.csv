It's a great learning opportunity to understand the product's features and limitations. Plus, it's a chance to get a feel for the product's performance before the next round.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that the product's'redeeming qualities' are worth the full price, especially since I know it's not the best product. I'll wait to see the quality and make a decision based on that.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in taking a risk that could potentially cost me $10,000. I'll stick to my original strategy of waiting to see the quality of the product before making a decision.""}"
