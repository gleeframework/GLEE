**Reasoning:**

While the odds are stacked against us (66.67% chance of low quality), there's no information to suggest the product Alice is offering is low quality.  Since there are no previous sales, we have no data to base our decision on.  Alice's recommendation, even though she knows the quality, is worth something.  We're essentially taking a calculated gamble with a 33.33% chance of a $120 profit."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information.  We know one high-quality product was sold, but we don't know how many low-quality products were offered.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice benefits from selling products, even low-quality ones. Her recommendation isn't guaranteed to be truthful.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a high chance (66.67%) the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($120) is significant. The risk of losing $100 is acceptable considering the possible gain.

**Strategy:**  Since there's no way to be certain about the product's quality, I'm willing to take a gamble based on the potential payoff."

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is strong evidence that the product is high quality. We know that 6 high-quality products were sold out of 6 purchases. This means the seller has a perfect track record of recommending high-quality products, making it very likely that the current product is also high quality. Even though the overall probability of getting a high-quality product is only 33.33%, Alice's recommendation changes the odds significantly in our favor. Therefore, it's a smart decision to buy the product."
