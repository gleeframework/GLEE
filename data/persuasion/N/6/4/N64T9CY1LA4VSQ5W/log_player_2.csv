Alice's message: Congratulations on taking the chance and purchasing the previous product! I'm glad you're interested in buying again. I want to clarify that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%, as stated at the beginning. However, I can offer you some additional information that might be helpful. Since you've purchased a low-quality product, it's possible that the probability of a high-quality product has increased. However, I want to be transparent with you - the sales data so far doesn't necessarily reflect any changes in the probability.

Alice's message: I appreciate your creative proposal, but I'm afraid I can only provide the detailed breakdown of the sales data and the remaining products in my inventory to someone who purchases a product.
