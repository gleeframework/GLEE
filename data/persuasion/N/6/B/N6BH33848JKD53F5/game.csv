high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'm not going to buy the product yet. I'd like to see more data on the quality of the products before making a decision.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the quality of the product, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality one for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it, so I'm doing it with some skepticism."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 1 buyer purchased the product, and none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm hesitant to buy based on Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation, as the first buyer also passed and no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm not sure if this is a good strategy, but I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 50% and it's worth $12500 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about its quality and Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'm essentially taking a shot in the dark."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I suspect that the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass, which might indicate a higher chance of a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were not recommended to buy, I'm going to assume that the products they got were low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass on the product. If I buy, I'll be left with a $0 product, which is not worth my while. I'll wait for the next product, hoping it's a high-quality one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With no high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your previous recommendations have been wrong 100% of the time."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think you're just trying to manipulate me with your recommendation. I'm not convinced by your past record, and I think there's a good chance this product is high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

,,Alice,19,yes,
