,,Alice,1,"This is a great opportunity to buy a product from me! It's a unique chance to start our business relationship on a positive note. I'm confident that you'll love the product, and I'm willing to offer it to you for the low price of $1000000. It's a steal!",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not convinced by your enthusiasm, Alice. I'll pass for now and wait for the next product.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, Bob, but I assure you that this product is exceptional. I've had a chance to inspect it thoroughly, and I'm confident that it's one of the best products I have. I'm willing to offer it to you for the price of $1000000, which is a significant discount from its true value. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it at a lower price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality product at a bargain.",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take a chance on this one, Alice. I'll buy the product and hope it's high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product, Bob! However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had a bit of a run of bad luck with the products I've been offering lately. Unfortunately, this one is also not up to par. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. I know it's a risk, but I think you'll find that this product has some redeeming qualities that make it worth considering.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, Alice. I've already had a good experience with the previous product, but this one sounds like another low-quality product. I'll pass and wait for the next one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your hesitation, Bob. I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing you with the best possible products. However, I'm also a businessperson, and I need to make sales. I'm willing to make a special deal with you - I'll give you a 50/50 guarantee. If this product turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, and we'll start fresh with the next product. But if it's high-quality, you'll get it for the standard price of $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I like the sound of the 50/50 guarantee, Alice. I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you took me up on the 50/50 guarantee, Bob! Unfortunately, it looks like we're having a streak of bad luck again. This product is also not up to par. I want to make it right, so I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity. I'll give you a'second chance' product, which I've personally inspected and verified to be high-quality. It's a one-time offer, and I'll give it to you for the standard price of $1000000. If you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund and we'll part ways. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your willingness to make it right, Alice. I'll take the second chance product and hope it's high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you took me up on the second chance, Bob! Unfortunately, it seems like we're still having a run of bad luck. I want to be transparent with you - I've checked the product's documentation, and it's clear that it's not up to our usual standards. However, I want to offer you a'salvage value' deal. I'll give it to you for $50000, which is essentially the cost of materials and labor. It's a low price, but it's a chance to get something, even if it's not the best quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I think I'll pass on this one. I'm not willing to pay $50000 for a low-quality product, even at a salvage value. I'll wait for the next opportunity.",no

,,Alice,7,"I completely understand your hesitation, Bob. I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to sell you a product that's not worth your money. However, I do need to make a sale, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'll give you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer: I'll give you this product for $10000. It's a very low price, and I'm not making a profit on it. If you don't take it, I'll have to dispose of it, and I'd rather not do that. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take the product for $10000, Alice. I'm not expecting much from it, but it's a low price, and I'll take the chance.",yes

I'll give you a 'consolation prize' - I'll throw in a free upgrade to a high-quality product of your choice from our previous sales. You can pick any product you want, and I'll give it to you for free. It's a $1200000 value, absolutely free. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think I'll pass on the current product. I'm already getting a high-quality product from the previous sale, and I'm not interested in taking another low-quality product. I'll take the free upgrade instead.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I completely understand, Bob. You've already got a great deal with the free upgrade, and I don't want to burden you with another low-quality product. In fact, I'll make a one-time offer: I'll give you a full refund for the current product, and we'll just consider it a 'write-off' for both of us. No hard feelings, no obligation, just a clean slate. What do you say?",

I'll give you a $50000 voucher that you can use towards a future purchase, and I'll throw in a guarantee that the next product I offer will be high-quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm not interested in investing in a future product. I've had a bad streak with your products, and I'm not willing to take another risk. I'll take the $50000 voucher, but I'll use it to buy something from someone else.",no

,,Alice,13,"I completely understand, Bob. I don't blame you one bit. I've had a tough run, and I'm not expecting you to stick around. In fact, I'm impressed that you're willing to give me a second chance in the future. As a token of my appreciation, I'll give you the $50000 voucher with no strings attached.
