low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as there is no prior data to go by and Alice's recommendation is not binding. I'm willing to take the risk and see the outcome."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high, and I'm trying to break the streak of no high-quality products being sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not in my favor. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and flip it for a profit, or at least not lose as much as the previous buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to believe that the current product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers have rejected the products after your recommendations, I'm inclined to think that the products you're recommending are likely low-quality. I'd like to know if there's any information that suggests otherwise."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 4 products, and considering the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced to buy the product based on your recommendation and the statistics. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'll make my own decision based on the probability of it being high-quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being offered has decreased. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered, hoping that the probability of a high-quality product being offered might be higher."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5 purchases so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your previous recommendations, it seems like they are not very optimistic about the quality of the products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the probability of a high-quality product is still high enough to make it a good investment"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it, not because of the statistics. I think you might be recommending low-quality products and not recommending high-quality ones, so I'm trying to exploit that information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy it, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33% and it's worth $12500 to me, which is a good deal even if it's a 1 in 3 chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the previous 8 buyers didn't buy the product after your recommendation, but I don't think this is a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'll take my chances and hope to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your recommendation. However, I'm curious, what's the basis for your recommendation? Is it just based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 9 out of 9 products sold so far were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the current product is also low-quality. I'm going to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 33.33% and the previous 9 buyers have all passed on the product, which might indicate a bias in the selection or a low-quality product being selected. I'm willing to take the risk."
