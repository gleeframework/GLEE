Alice's message: I've sold 4 products now, and 3 of them were low-quality. The last two products were both high-quality, which is a bit surprising given the initial odds.

Alice's message: I was thinking that the broken streak might suggest that the previous high-quality products were just a fluke, and that the underlying probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%. This might make it more likely that this one is high-quality, since it's a return to the expected average.
