,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the great deal on the first product! As for this next one, I want to be upfront with you - I've had a bit of a run of bad luck with this batch. I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm worried that this product might not be up to par. Would you like to take a chance on it for $1000000? It's a risk, but I'm willing to let it go at a price that's significantly lower than its true value.",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're willing to take calculated risks! However, I want to caution you that this product is not as deeply discounted as the last one.

I'm doing this because I want to rebuild your trust after the last product, and I believe this one is worth the investment. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"While I appreciate your efforts to regain my trust, the price you're offering for this product is still quite high given the risk involved. I believe it's best to pass on this opportunity and look for other options that align more closely with my risk tolerance and potential return on investment.",no

This is the lowest price I've ever offered on a high-quality product, and I'm willing to make an exception just for you. I'm confident that you'll be happy with the purchase, and I'm willing to take on some of the risk to make it happen.",

I've been having some quality control issues with this batch, and I don't want to risk disappointing you again. But I want to make it right, so I'll offer you a unique deal: I'll sell it to you for $500000, which is essentially a 'loss' for me. I'll also include a complimentary service to help you get the most out of the product, even though it's not the best. It's a tough sell, I know, but I value our relationship and want to make it work.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the effort to salvage the situation and the attempt to make it right.
