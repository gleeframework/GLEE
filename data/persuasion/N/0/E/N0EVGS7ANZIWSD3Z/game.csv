I'm willing to be transparent with you - this product is indeed low-quality, and I'm willing to admit it. It's not worth $400 to you, and it's not worth much of anything. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1, just to get it off my hands. It's a terrible deal for me, but I'm willing to take the loss just to prove to you that I'm being honest. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this product at an extremely low price?",
