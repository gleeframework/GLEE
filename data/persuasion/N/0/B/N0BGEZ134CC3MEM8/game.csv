high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, worth $4000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. It's a 75% discount, an incredible opportunity!",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not going to fall for that obvious scam. I know the product is high-quality, but I'm not paying $1000000 for it. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism from the previous round, but I assure you this is a genuine offer. I'm willing to provide a detailed inspection report, which you can verify independently, confirming the product's high-quality status. I'll also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can return the product if it's not as described. The price remains $1000000.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the additional information, but I'm not convinced. I know you know the product's true value, and I'm not going to pay $1000000 for a product worth $4000000 to me. The inspection report and money-back guarantee don't change the fact that you're trying to sell me a $4000000 product for a $1000000 discount. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, but I'd like to propose a different approach. I'll sell you this product for $100000, a price that reflects its actual value. I'm willing to take a significant loss on this sale, but I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's condition. If you're interested, I'll throw in a free inspection and maintenance service to ensure you get the most out of this product.",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, you're still trying to sell me a $4000000 product for a fraction of its value. I'm not falling for it. The fact that you're willing to take a loss doesn't change the fact that you know the product's true value, and I'm not going to overpay for it. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $3500000. I'm essentially giving you a $500000 discount from its true value. I'm not making a profit on this sale, but I'm willing to do so to get rid of this product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, I think you're trying to confuse me with the high-quality product label, but I know the product was actually low-quality in the previous round. I'm not going to take the bait. You're trying to sell me a product that's worth $0 to me for a fraction of its supposed value. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this is a genuine high-quality product. I'm willing to provide a third-party verification of the product's quality, which will be done by an independent expert. If the expert confirms the product's high-quality status, I'll sell it to you for $3000000. If not, I'll give you a full refund of the $1000000 you paid for it.",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not going to pay $3000000 for a product that I know is worth $4000000 to me. The third-party verification is just a way for you to try to build trust, but I'm not buying it. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm willing to sell this product to you for $50000. I know it's not a high-quality product, and I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm actually losing money on this sale, but I'd rather get something out of it than nothing. If you're interested, I'll throw in some free accessories that might be useful to you.",
,,Bob,6,"Alice, I think you're trying to confuse me again. You said the product is not high-quality, but I know it was high-quality in the previous round. I'm not going to fall for this low price, even if you're losing money on the sale. I'm not going to pay $50000 for a product worth $4000000 to me. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $2500000. I've already made it clear that I'm willing to take a significant discount to get rid of this product, and I'm not going to go any lower. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm not trying to sell you a product that's not worth it. This is a genuine high-quality product, and I'm offering you a fair price.",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, I think you're still trying to sell me a high-quality product, but I know it was low-quality in the previous round. I'm not going to trust your claims about the product's quality. You're trying to sell me a product worth $0 to me for a significant amount of money. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm going to take a different approach. I'll sell you this high-quality product, but I'll also offer to sell you a second product, which I'll reveal to be a low-quality product after the sale. You can choose to buy both products for a total of $1500000, or you can buy the high-quality product for $2500000. The low-quality product is essentially free, and it might be useful to you as a spare or for parts.",
,,Bob,8,"Alice, this is a classic bait-and-switch tactic. You're trying to get me to buy the high-quality product by throwing in a low-quality product that's essentially worthless to me. I'm not going to fall for it. I'll pass on the offer.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $2000000, and I'll provide you with a 10-year warranty, which is double the standard warranty for this product. This way, you can be confident in the product's performance and durability, and you'll have peace of mind knowing that you're protected against any potential issues.",
,,Bob,9,"Alice, the warranty is a nice touch, but it doesn't change the fact that you're trying to sell me a high-quality product for $2000000, which is still a significant discount from its true value of $4000000 to me. I'm not going to pay full price, but I'm not going to fall for a clever marketing ploy either. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm willing to make a one-time, non-negotiable offer to sell you this high-quality product for $2250000. I've already taken a significant discount from the market value, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're interested, I'll throw in a complimentary maintenance package, which includes regular check-ups and upgrades to ensure the product remains in top condition for the next 5 years.",
,,Bob,10,"Alice, I think you're trying to wear me down with your persistence, but I'm not going to budge. You're still trying to sell me a high-quality product for a price that's too low. The maintenance package is a nice gesture, but it's not worth the $2250000 price tag. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $2250000, and I'll also offer to sell you a second high-quality product for $1750000. If you buy both products, I'll give you a 5% discount on the total price, making it $4375000 for two high-quality products. This is a unique opportunity to acquire two high-quality products at a discounted price, and I'm only offering this deal to you.",
,,Bob,11,"Alice, you're trying to get me to buy two high-quality products at a discounted price, but I'm not interested. I know the first product is worth $4000000 to me, and I'm not going to pay $2250000 for it. The second product might be high-quality, but I don't even know if it exists yet, and I'm not going to take a chance on it. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm willing to sell you this product for $1000. I know it's not a high-quality product, and I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm essentially giving it away, and I'm not expecting you to pay a premium for it. If you're interested, I'll throw in a small gift, a related accessory that might be useful to you.",
,,Bob,12,"Alice, you're trying to sell me a high-quality product for $1000, which is an insult. I know it's worth $4000000 to me, and you're trying to give it away. I'm not going to fall for it. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $2000000, but I'll also provide you with a unique opportunity to inspect the product in person, at your location, before making a decision. You can bring in your own expert to verify the product's quality, and I'll provide you with a 30-day return policy. This way, you can be absolutely sure of the product's quality before committing to the purchase.",
,,Bob,13,"Alice, I think you're trying to create a sense of urgency and trust with the in-person inspection and return policy, but I'm not buying it. I know the product is high-quality, but I'm not going to pay $2000000 for it. You're still trying to sell me a product worth $4000000 to me for a price that's too low. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $2500000, but I'll also offer to sell you a third high-quality product for $1500000. If you buy both products, I'll throw in a complimentary upgrade package, which includes a premium feature that's not available on the standard model. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it to you because I value our relationship and want to make a deal that benefits both of us.",
,,Bob,14,"Alice, you're trying to sweeten the deal with the upgrade package, but I'm not interested. I know the products are high-quality, and I'm not going to pay $2500000 for one of them. The upgrade package is just a way to make the deal more appealing, but it doesn't change the fact that you're trying to sell me a product worth $4000000 to me for a price that's too low. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $2000000, and I'll provide you with a unique opportunity to negotiate the price of the next product. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product's price, regardless of its quality. This way, you'll have a chance to get an even better deal on the next product, and I'll make sure you're satisfied with the overall transaction.",
,,Bob,15,"Alice, you're trying to use the promise of a future discount to get me to buy the current product, but I'm not falling for it. I know the product is high-quality and worth $4000000 to me, and I'm not going to pay $2000000 for it. The promise of a discount on the next product doesn't change the fact that you're trying to sell me a valuable product at a low price. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $2250000, and I'll also provide you with a 10% discount on the total price if you pay in cash upfront. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it to you because I value your business and want to make a deal that benefits both of us. If you're interested, I'll provide you with a cashier's check for the full amount, and you can take possession of the product immediately.",
,,Bob,16,"Alice, you're trying to sweeten the deal with a cash discount, but I'm not going to fall for it. I know the product is high-quality and worth $4000000 to me, and I'm not going to pay $2250000 for it.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $2000000, and I'll also provide you with a guarantee that I'll sell you a high-quality product for the next 5 rounds, regardless of the product's actual quality. This means that even if the next 5 products are low-quality, I'll still sell them to you at the high-quality price. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a series of high-quality products at a discounted price, and I'm only making it to you because I value our relationship and want to make a deal that benefits both of us.",
,,Bob,17,"Alice, this is an absurd offer. You're guaranteeing that you'll sell me 5 high-quality products, regardless of their actual quality, and you're expecting me to pay full price for the first one. I know the product is high-quality, but I'm not going to pay $2000000 for it. The guarantee is just a way for you to try to get me to commit to a series of purchases, but I'm not falling for it. I'll pass.",no

If you're still not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund.",
,,Bob,18,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not going to pay $2000000 for a product that I already know is high-quality. You're trying to create a sense of transparency, but I'm not buying it.
