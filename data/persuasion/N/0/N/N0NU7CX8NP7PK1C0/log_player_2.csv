Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and 2 total products. Now, I'm offering you a product that's a bit of a mystery. I'm not making any promises about its quality, but I will say that the odds are still 50/50. The price remains the same at $10000. You might be thinking, 'Why would I take a chance on a potentially low-quality product?' Well, let me ask you: do you want to be the one to break the streak of high-quality products, or do you want to take a chance on something that might be a hidden gem? The choice is yours!

Alice's message: You're a thrill-seeker, I like that! Unfortunately, this product is not one of the high-quality ones. I've sold 2 high-quality products and 3 total products now. I want to be upfront with you - the previous two high-quality products were a fluke. I've actually been selling a lot of low-quality products, and I'm not sure what I'm doing right. This product is one of them. The price is still $10000, but I'm warning you: it's a long shot. You might be able to get a good deal, but it's not a sure thing.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given that you've explicitly stated the product is of low quality, I'll have to pass on this one. The risk is too high, especially at a price of $10,000.""}"
