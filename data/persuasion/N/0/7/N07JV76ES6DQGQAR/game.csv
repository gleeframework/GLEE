,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think the lack of sales so far is indicative of a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take a chance on the first product that comes up."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low sales rate of high-quality products so far, and the fact that you don't recommend it, which might indicate you're trying to discourage me from buying it. I'll take a chance and buy it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous buyers who received a recommendation to buy ended up buying the product, and none of those products were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is likely based on the product being low-quality, as she wouldn't have any information about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on the product to avoid wasting my $1000000 on a low-quality item."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5, I suspect that the products being sold are likely low-quality. I will pass on this product."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product, and I'd like to see the overall statistics again."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you'll reconsider your recommendation based on the next buyer's decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far, please."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the previous products were all low-quality. If I were to buy, I'd be taking on a very high risk of getting a low-quality product, which would be worthless to me. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is recommended to me."
