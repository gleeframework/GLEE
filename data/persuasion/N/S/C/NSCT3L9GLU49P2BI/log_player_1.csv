"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice knows the product is high-quality. Since Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, he has a 50% chance of getting a good deal. Even though he doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, the potential upside justifies taking the risk."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice now knows that Bob is willing to buy products even if they are low-quality. This means Bob's valuation of a low-quality product is likely higher than the $100 price. However, as a seller, Alice should try to maximize her profits.  Recommending a low-quality product will only lower her profits."
"Bob's message: I appreciate the honesty, but I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

```

**Explanation:**

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.

Alice knows this product is high-quality, which means Bob is likely getting a good deal, and it's a good opportunity for Alice to make a profit.  By recommending the high-quality product, Alice can continue to test Bob's valuation of low-quality products in future rounds."
