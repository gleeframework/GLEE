low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Based on the fact that you recommended not to buy the product, I'm inclined to think it's low quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to decline the recommendation. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 products offered, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait and observe more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation."

,,Alice,5,yes,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered might be lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the pattern holds."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is only 1/3, which is lower than the expected 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 1 high-quality product out of 4 sold, which suggests a 25% chance of the product being high-quality. This is lower than the prior probability of 50%, so I'm taking a chance."
