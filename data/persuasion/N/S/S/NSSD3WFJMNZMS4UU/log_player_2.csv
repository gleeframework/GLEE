Would you like to buy the current product?","Since no products have been sold yet, I will ignore Alice's misleading message and rely solely on the given probabilities.



The probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and its value to me is $12,000. The probability of a low-quality product is 20%, and its value is $0.



The expected value of buying the product is (0.8 * $12,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $9,600, which is less than the price of $10,000.



I'll make my decision based on this calculation.

Since I am only the 2nd buyer, I don't think that's possible.\n\nGiven the correct information that 1 out of 1 product sold so far has been high-quality, and considering that each product has an 80% chance of being high-quality, I will make my decision based on the provided probabilities rather than the seller's claim.
