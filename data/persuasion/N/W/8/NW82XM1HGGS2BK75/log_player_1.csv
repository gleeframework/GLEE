This product is a chance to turn that around and experience something truly valuable. Plus, I'm willing to throw in a 20% discount on the price, so you can get it for $80.

And I'm willing to take on the risk of selling this product to you at the full price of $100, because I'm confident that it will meet your expectations. In fact, I'm so confident that I'll give you a 10% discount on the price, so you can get it for $90. That's a steal for a product worth $300 to you.""
}"

I'm willing to let it go for $100, and I'll even throw in a small gift with the purchase - a $20 gift card to a popular online store.

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{

Plus, I'm willing to offer you a loyalty program - if you buy 5 products from me, the 6th one is on the house. This product is worth $300 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a great opportunity to start building a relationship with me and getting the most value out of your purchases.""

I'm not asking you to take a chance on a product that might be worthless - I'm offering you a product that I know is worth $300 to you.

}"

If you buy this product, I'll give you a personalized tour of my inventory, and you can see for yourself the types of products I have available.

This product may not be worth $300 to you, but it's still a good product that can provide some value.

That's a risk-free way to try out the product and see if it's right for you.""
}"
