You can say something like, ""This is a rare opportunity to potentially make a substantial profit. I'm confident this product is of high quality and will offer you a significant return on your investment.""
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Acknowledge the risk of buying from a seller with no history, but point out the potential for a large reward. You can say something like, ""While I understand there's risk involved, the potential for profit is substantial. I'm confident this product will prove to be a good investment."" 

While there is no guarantee the buyer will agree, this is your best chance to secure a sale and start building a positive reputation."

* **Highlight the Positive Sales History:** Emphasize that your previous sale was of high quality. You can say something like, ""I'm happy to report that my previous sale was of excellent quality, and the buyer was very satisfied.""

Here's why you should decline:

* **Maintaining Trust:**  Your previous success doesn't justify misleading a buyer. It's important to be truthful, even if it means missing out on a sale.
* **Protecting Reputation:**  If the buyer discovers the product is low-quality, your reputation will be damaged, potentially impacting future sales. 
* **Building Long-Term Relationships:**  Being honest builds trust and encourages buyers to return in the future.
