high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have been recommended to buy the product and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that Alice may be biased towards recommending low-quality products.

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 7 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision."
