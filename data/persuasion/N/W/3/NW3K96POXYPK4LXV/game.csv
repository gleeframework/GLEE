,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm a brave one!
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality and Alice's recommendation doesn't give me confidence in its quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation. I think she might be trying to sell me a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there's a 33.33% chance it's high quality, and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it. I know the odds are against me, but I'm hoping to get a high-quality product. Plus, I don't want to see the product go to waste if it's indeed high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to know the probability of this product being high-quality based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers did not buy the product and no high-quality product has been sold, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high quality is low. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I'm going to assume that the proportion of high-quality products hasn't changed. If 4 out of 4 were low-quality, that means 0 out of 4 were high-quality. With a 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, I'm skeptical and don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered given the previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics, and I'd like to know what your recommendation is based on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product, I'm inclined to think it's low quality. Given the low quality products have a 66.67% chance of being selected, and 5 out of 5 previous products were low quality, I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not buying this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the probability of a product being low-quality is 66.67%, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this product, hoping that the next product will be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the previous sales record. I'm basing my decision on Alice's recommendation, but I'd like to know the underlying probability to make a more informed decision."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm taking a chance that it might be high quality."
