low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any prior information to go on. I'm essentially taking a wild guess."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision and the statistics of the products before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have enough information about its quality and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that you don't recommend it and there's been no sales of high-quality products so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd also like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. Is it possible to share that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation and I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if it's a high-quality product or not, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, it's likely that the products sold so far were low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I have no information to suggest otherwise, I'll pass on this product to get a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered might be higher than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to the previous buyers. I would like to pass on this product and not contribute to the statistics that might be misleading."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure why you're not recommending it. Can you explain? Is it because you've seen a pattern in the products that I'm not aware of?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm hoping to be the one to get the high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm going to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, it suggests that the products recommended by you were likely low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's reasonable to assume that the product you're offering now is also low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take my chances based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Given that 7 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is very low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers have also been discouraged by your recommendations and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what's going on, but 7 out of 7 buyers passing on a product that has a 33.33% chance of being high quality seems suspicious. I'd like to know the true quality of this product."
