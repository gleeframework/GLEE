Alice's message: Thank you for considering our product! I'm happy to share with you that the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product was a savvy shopper who appreciated the value of our product. They were impressed by our 50% success rate and felt confident that they were taking a calculated risk. They were also willing to pay the fixed price of $100, which shows that they valued the product's potential benefits. As for me, I'd like to assure you that I'm still committed to offering a great product, even if this one happens to be a low-quality one. I'm offering it to you for $100, and I'm confident that you'll find it a good deal. What do you think?
