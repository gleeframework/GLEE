**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We have very little data to go on. Only one buyer has purchased before, and it was a high-quality product. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, despite not knowing the quality of the product, is recommending a purchase. This could be a strong signal, particularly if she has a good reputation for accuracy or if she benefits from selling products.
* **Risk/Reward:**  The potential gain ($125) outweighs the potential loss ($0).  Even if the product is low quality, the cost is only $100, and the chance of it being high quality is 50%.

**It's important to note:** This is a high-risk decision with very limited information."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice.  While I appreciate your advice, I'm going to pass on this product.  The fact that you're not recommending it makes me concerned about its quality, especially since the sales record shows two high-quality products have already been sold.  I'm happy to consider future offers from you.""}

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We have a very small sample size (only 2 previous buyers).
* **Positive Signal:** Two high-quality products being sold is a strong positive signal, suggesting the seller might have a better understanding of quality than random chance.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which implies she believes it to be high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's still a 50% chance of it being low quality, the potential reward of $125 outweighs the risk of losing $100.

This strategy balances risk and reward, leveraging the limited information available."
