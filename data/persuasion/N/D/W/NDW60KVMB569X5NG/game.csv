low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. Given that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1 product sold, the proportion of high-quality products is 100%, which is an outlier. I'm concerned that this might be a biased sample, and I'd rather wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
