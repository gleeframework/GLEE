low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since I'm the first buyer and there's no prior data to go by."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased a product? Did they also receive a recommendation to buy?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is significantly lower than the expected 80.00% chance of a high-quality product. I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,

,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation from Alice is not a reliable indicator of its quality, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, and I'll get a good deal."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. How many products have been offered in total, and what's the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice didn't recommend it, which suggests it might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and not lose $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the fact that you recommended it. This suggests a higher chance of it being low-quality."

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $10000. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous three buyers didn't buy the products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping to get a high-quality one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous buyers bought the product, I'm inclined to think that they were all low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, I've seen that none of the previous products were high-quality, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products sold were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 20% chance of a product being low-quality, this is a significant deviation from the expected probability. I believe Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that she knows the product is low-quality. I would like to pass on the product and hope that a future buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
