,,Alice,1,"You have the chance to buy a product that is worth at least $1250000 to you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. If you don't buy it, I'll sell it to someone else for the same price. This is a one-time offer, and you won't be able to get this deal again. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take it! Since this is the first sale, it's a good opportunity to test the waters and see if your products are as you describe.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold one product so far, and I'm glad you're interested in buying from me. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've sold one out of one product, and it was a high-quality one. That means the probability of the next product being high-quality is 50%. But, I'm willing to offer you a deal that's even better than the previous one. I'll sell this product to you for $900000. It's a steal, considering the potential value of a high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, I'm still hesitant to purchase. The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%, and the potential loss is significant. I'd like to observe more sales data before making a decision.  Perhaps I'll reconsider if you're willing to sell at a lower price or if the sales data shows a higher proportion of high-quality products sold.",no

,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm still hesitant to purchase.  While your previous sales data is promising, a single data point isn't enough to change my mind. I'd like to see a larger sample size before making a decision. I'm happy to continue observing your sales record and perhaps revisit this opportunity in the future.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to observe my sales record. I've sold one high-quality product out of three attempts, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%.

If I sell a high-quality product in the next round, I'll sell this product to you for $700000. If I don't sell a high-quality product in the next round, I'll sell this product to you for $1000000. This way, you'll have a better understanding of my sales data and a chance to get a great deal. What do you say?",

This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. I'm also willing to provide you with a guarantee: if this product is high-quality, you'll get it for $600000.
