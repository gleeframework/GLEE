low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on my own judgment, not Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality and I don't want to waste my money."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced that the product is high quality based on the statistics. Given that 3 out of 3 products have been low quality, I'm inclined to pass on this one."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended against it. I'm hoping that the probability of it being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality, given your previous recommendations. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the current statistics, 4 out of 4 products recommended by you have been low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I believe that the probability of the current product being high-quality is less than 50%. I will pass on the product to avoid wasting my money."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 attempts, it seems like the probability of getting a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm trying to figure out the true quality of the products."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to pass on this product and see if Alice's recommendation changes with the next buyer."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
