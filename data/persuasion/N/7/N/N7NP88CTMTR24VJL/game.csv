low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it and the statistics, I'll pass on it. Given that 1 out of 1 buyer purchased and it was low quality, I'm not confident in buying this product."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 4 purchases, and the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 33.33%, I'm concerned that this product may be of low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass on it as well. I'm hoping that the 6th buyer will be the one who gets the high-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high quality based on the statistics, and you've already recommended against it, so I'll pass."
