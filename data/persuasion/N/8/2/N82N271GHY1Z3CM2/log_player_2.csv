**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to work with. We don't know how many buyers have *passed* on offers, only how many have *bought*. This makes it difficult to assess the reliability of Alice's recommendations.
* **High Potential Reward:** The potential payoff for a high-quality product is significant ($12,000).
* **50/50 Odds:**  Since the odds of a high-quality product are 50%, the risk is balanced by the potential reward.

**Conclusion:**  Given the limited information, buying the product is the best strategy. Even though Alice's recommendations are not proven to be reliable, the potential reward outweighs the risk."

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky scenario because it is a classic example of a situation with asymmetric information. Alice has more information about the product's quality than you do. However, we can still reason through the situation:

* **The seller's recommendation:** Alice recommending you to buy the product is a signal. Even though she can be deceitful, there's a chance she's being honest, and the product is indeed high quality.
* **Previous sales data:** The fact that one high-quality product out of three sales is quite low. This suggests that Alice might be more likely to recommend low-quality products to increase her sales. 
* **The odds:** However, the odds of the product being high-quality are still 50%.  

**Ultimately, the decision boils down to risk tolerance.  Since the potential gain ($12,000) is significant, and there's a 50% chance of it being high quality, it's worth the risk.**"
