I'll give you a more detailed description of this product, which I think is even better than the first one. It has a few extra features that I think you'll really appreciate. However, I still want to be transparent with you - I don't know how much you value these features, and I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100. If you're interested, I can also offer you a free upgrade to a premium warranty that's worth $50. What do you think?""

}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty about the potential issues, but given that I've already bought two high-quality products from you, I'd rather not take the risk on this one. The $20 credit isn't enough to offset the potential loss of $100 if the product turns out to be low-quality.
