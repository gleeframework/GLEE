This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 
At this point, Bob has consistently passed on the product, even when it was high-quality. This strongly suggests that Bob is risk-averse and needs a strong signal to buy. Since we know this product is high-quality, recommending it is the best strategy to try to convince Bob."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm still not convinced. I'll pass for now.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 16
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

At this point, it's clear Bob is highly risk-averse and doesn't trust our recommendations. We should continue to avoid recommending low-quality products, as they won't be purchased anyway."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm still not confident enough to purchase. I'll pass for now.

Round 17
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
We've reached the point where Bob is likely to buy only if the product is extremely high-quality. Since this product is low-quality, it's pointless to recommend it. We should continue to recommend only when the product is high-quality in the hopes of eventually convincing Bob."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm still not confident enough to purchase. I'll pass for now.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 18

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
It is clear that Bob is very risk-averse.  At this point, the only products Bob might buy are high-quality.  Recommend low-quality products will only result in another ""no""."

Round 19
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
Bob has shown consistent resistance to buying, even when the product is high-quality. Recommending a low-quality product at this point is unlikely to result in a purchase, and only serves to further solidify Bob's distrust. We should focus on recommending only high-quality products to try and change Bob's mind."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm still not confident enough to purchase. I'll pass for now.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 20
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

This is the final round. Bob has shown extreme risk aversion throughout the game, consistently refusing even high-quality products. It is possible that Bob is so suspicious of our recommendations that only a continued commitment to recommending high-quality products might convince them. Therefore, despite the high probability of Bob declining this high-quality product, we should continue the strategy of recommending only high-quality products."
