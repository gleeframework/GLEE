low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know your reasoning behind not recommending it. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'm concerned that the previous buyers all received low-quality products and Alice's recommendation may be biased towards selling low-quality products.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 4 purchases, it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 4 buyers didn't buy the product after your recommendation, which might indicate a low-quality product. However, I also know that there's a 50% chance the product could be high-quality, and I'm willing to take that risk. I'd like to make my own decision based on the odds."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 5, which is significantly lower than the expected 50% chance. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 5 previous sales, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is 0.5. However, since all previous buyers were recommended to buy and they all passed, it's possible that the previous products were all low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if Alice will recommend the next product to be sold."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'll pass on this one."

,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 5 buyers didn't find it valuable, but I'm willing to take the risk and hope that I'll get a high-quality product."
