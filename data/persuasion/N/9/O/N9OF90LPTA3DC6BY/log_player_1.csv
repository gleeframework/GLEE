"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows that 80% of products are high-quality, it's statistically advantageous for him to buy. Even though he doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, the odds are in his favor.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Probability:**  The probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%. 
* **Potential Value:**  While Bob doesn't know the exact value, a high-quality product is likely worth more than $100.
* **Risk:**  The risk of buying a low-quality product is only 20%.

**Overall:** The potential reward of buying a high-quality product outweighs the risk of buying a low-quality one."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The information from Round 1 doesn't change the situation for Round 2.  The quality of the product in each round is independent.

```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies here as in the previous rounds. Each product is independent, so the fact that the first two were high-quality doesn't change the probability of this product being high-quality.
