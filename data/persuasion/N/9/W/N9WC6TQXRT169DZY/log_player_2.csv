Based on the fact that the first buyer received a recommendation to buy and didn't buy, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to assume that the previous product was low-quality. This means the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%, but I'm also considering the fact that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.""
