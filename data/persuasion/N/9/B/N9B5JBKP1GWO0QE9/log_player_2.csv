```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently recommended high-quality products in the first four rounds. It's becoming increasingly likely that she has some way of assessing the quality of the products.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has been perfectly accurate in her recommendations so far.  Her sudden change in behavior is significant. It's possible that she's now recommending against a product that is truly low quality.
