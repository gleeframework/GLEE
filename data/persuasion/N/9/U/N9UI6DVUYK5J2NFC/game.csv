high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 only to be worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm the first one, and I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just have to take a chance."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and Alice's recommendation is not very informative given the statistics. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it to gather more information for future reference. I'm not relying on your recommendation to make my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm taking a chance because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 50% and I don't want to pass up the opportunity to get a potentially valuable product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because of the statistics, or is it based on something else?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I'm the 4th buyer and I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate that the previous products were low quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that the probability is 50%. I'd like to make an educated guess based on the available information."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being low quality is higher than the probability of it being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure if I should buy it based on the previous sales record, but since you don't recommend it, I'll pass on it. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record?"

,,Alice,13,no,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality, and since none have been sold so far, I don't have a good feeling about the proportion of high-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given your recommendation and the fact that 4 previous buyers also passed on the product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when I know it's only worth $0 to me."
