high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to wait and see the recommendation for the next buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, since I have no information about its quality and the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the probability of it being high quality is low given the previous buyer didn't buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, given that the first buyer didn't buy after seeing your recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers also passed, and none of the products sold so far have been high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the probability of it being low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and since you don't recommend it, I'll pass."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the current statistics. With 2 sales and 0 high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This suggests that the products sold so far may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products, as I'm curious to know the probability of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite Alice's recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the low sales record so far?"

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of Alice's lack of recommendation. I'm not convinced it's a good idea, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is reliable given the current statistics, and I'd rather wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is against it, which makes me think the product is more likely to be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low sales and no high-quality products sold so far. I'll buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to know more about the products before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that none of the previous 7 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and avoid the $1000000 cost of a low-quality product."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me."
