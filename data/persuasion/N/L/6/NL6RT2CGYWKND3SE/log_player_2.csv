I know you just got a great deal on the first one, but this one is even better. It's a limited edition item, and I'm only offering it to you for $100.

This next product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to offer you a special 'guarantee' on it.

But I do want to offer you a chance to diversify your collection. This next product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to offer you a 'certification of authenticity' to go along with it.

I've had a few of these in stock for a while, and I'm looking to clear them out. It's a great opportunity for you to get a deal on a product that's still worth something to you, even if it's not as valuable as the others. I'm offering it to you for the same price as the others, $100, but I'm not giving you any guarantees about its value. You'll have to decide for yourself if it's a good fit for you.
