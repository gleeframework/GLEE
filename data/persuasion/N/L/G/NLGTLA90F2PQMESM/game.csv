To be upfront, I've had some issues with this product, and it's not as good as the one we sold last time. However, it's still a legitimate product that has some value.

However, I'll also throw in a unique perk: I'll give you a 10% discount if you're willing to commit to buying the next product that comes up, regardless of its quality. This way, you'll get a great deal on a high-quality product, and you'll also secure a potential future discount. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm interested in the offer, but I want to clarify that the 10% discount on the next product only applies if I buy the current product. If I don't like the next product, I won't be bound by the discount. Can you confirm that's correct?",yes
