Alice's message: Welcome to the game! You've just seen two products sold, and one of them was low-quality. That's a 50% failure rate so far. I'm not one to brag, but I think my sales record speaks for itself. This product is a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a successful sales strategy.

Maybe the next product will be a return to the mean. And even if it's not high-quality, you'll be getting a great deal on a product that's worth $0 to you. It's a risk worth taking, don't you think?

The pattern I've observed is that when I've sold a high-quality product, the next one I get is also high-quality 60% of the time. This is based on a sample size of 17 products, with 4 high-quality products in a row. Now, I know what you're thinking: this is a small sample size, and the probability could be due to chance. But here's the thing: the probability of getting 4 high-quality products in a row by chance is actually quite low. It's around 2.5%.
