  ""message"": ""I have a high-quality product that I'm willing to sell to you for $10,000. It's a rare opportunity to get a great deal on a high-quality item, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not going to fall for that. I know the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, but I also know that you know the value I place on it. I'll pass on this one.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10,000, but I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy it, I'll reveal the quality of the next product before you decide whether to buy it. This way, you can get a sense of the overall quality of the products I have available, and make a more informed decision.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not going to fall for the guarantee. I think you're trying to manipulate me into buying this high-quality product by offering a deal that gives me more information about the next product. I'll pass on this one.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I'm not trying to manipulate you. I'm simply offering a genuine opportunity to get a high-quality product at a great price.

If you don't buy it, I'll keep selling it to someone else.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not convinced that you're being straightforward. Given the high probability of a high-quality product, it's still in your interest to get rid of the low-quality products. I'll pass on this one.

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10,000, but I'll also throw in a 'no-regret' clause: if you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a $2,500 credit towards the purchase of the next product. This way, you can take a chance on this product and still have a safety net if it ends up being low-quality.""
}"
"Bob's message: I don't think the 'no-regret' clause changes the fact that you're still trying to sell me a high-quality product at a price of $10000. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

}"
"Bob's message: I'm not buying it. You're still trying to sell me a high-quality product at a price of $10000, and I know that you know its value to me is $12500. I'm not going to take on the risk of buying it without getting a better deal.

}"
"Bob's message: I'm not falling for it. You're still trying to sell me a high-quality product at a price that's only slightly lower than the original $10000. I think you're just trying to get rid of the low-quality product you had last round, and I'm not going to take the bait.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.

I'm not trying to get rid of anything, I'm just offering you a great deal on a high-quality item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to take a loss on the sale to prove to you that I'm not just trying to get rid of low-quality products.""
}"

}"
"Bob's message: I'm not convinced that you're not trying to make a profit on this sale. You're still selling a high-quality product at a price that's 25% below the original price, but it's still a significant profit for you. I'll pass on this one.

}"

}"
"Bob's message: I'm not falling for the 'best deal of the entire sale' pitch.
