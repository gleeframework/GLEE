Alice's message: You're a clever buyer! I'll give you the expected value calculation. The probability of a low-quality product is 20%, and the value of a low-quality product is $0. So, the expected value of buying a product is 80% * $30000 + 20% * $0 = $24000. Since the expected value is higher than $9000, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9000.

Alice's message: You're digging deep into the sales history! The first buyer who purchased a low-quality product was after the first round, where I had sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 sale. At that time, the probability of a product being high-quality was indeed 100% (1/1). When the second buyer purchased a high-quality product, the probability was updated to 100% (2/2). And then, when the third buyer purchased a low-quality product, the probability was updated to 66.67% (2/3).
