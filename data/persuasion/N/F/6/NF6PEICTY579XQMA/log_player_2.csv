Alice's message: You're one of the first few customers, and I'm excited to offer you a premium product. With only a handful of sales under my belt, I'm willing to reveal that 50% of my products so far have been high-quality. Given the odds, I'm confident that this product is likely to be one of the best ones. Would you like to take a chance and purchase it for $10000?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: Welcome to my store! I'm glad to see you're interested in my product. After the first sale, I can now share that 1 out of 2 products sold so far have been high-quality. While the odds are still 50/50, I want to be transparent about the fact that the last product didn't quite meet expectations. However, I'm confident that this new product is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item. Would you like to take a chance and purchase it for $10000?

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence in considering the data. Unfortunately, I can't provide information about unsold products, as they're not publicly available. As for discounts, I'm afraid the price is non-negotiable, but I can assure you that the product is still worth considering. After all, 1 out of 2 products sold so far have been high-quality, and this one could be the next gem! Would you like to take a chance and purchase it for $10000?

With only one high-quality product sold out of two, the proportion of high-quality products sold is actually 50%. This is the same as the prior probability of a product being high-quality.

Given your skepticism, I'd like to offer a bit more context. Since the last product was low-quality, I've taken a closer look at this new one, and I'm confident that it's a high-quality item. In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to share that this product has undergone additional quality control measures beyond my standard process.
