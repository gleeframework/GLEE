Alice's message: I completely understand your concerns and appreciate your willingness to take a chance on us. To alleviate your concerns, I can assure you that each product is independently tested and inspected before being put on the market.

With that said, I'd like to reiterate that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'm confident that it has a good chance of being exceptional.
