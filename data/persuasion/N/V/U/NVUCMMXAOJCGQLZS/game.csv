,,Alice,5,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, especially since I know the probability of it being high quality is 33.33%."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Are you trying to avoid selling a high-quality product to me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high, and I don't want to give up the opportunity to buy it. I'm doing this based on the fact that you haven't recommended it to me, which might suggest that it's a low-quality product, but I'm not convinced that's the case."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,

,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I suspect that all 6 products were low-quality. If I were to buy the product, I'd be essentially paying $10000 for a product worth $0 to me, which is a bad deal. I'd like to wait for more information or a better opportunity."
