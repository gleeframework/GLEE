"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice recommending the product doesn't necessarily mean it's high quality, but it does give us some information. Since the probability of a high-quality product is much higher (80%), it's still a good gamble to take. The potential reward of $200 ($300 value - $100 price) outweighs the potential loss of $100."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she *doesn't* recommend this product, it likely means it's low quality. We know she has perfect information about the product, so her decision to not recommend it strongly suggests it's not worth the risk. It's better to pass and wait for a potentially better opportunity."
