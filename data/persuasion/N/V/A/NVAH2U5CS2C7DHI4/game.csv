high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and still passed, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I would like to pass on the current product.

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation might be influenced by her desire to get rid of a low-quality product, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers didn't buy after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the previous products were low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered, as the probability of it being high-quality might be higher."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were recommended and both were low quality. I'm skeptical about the recommendation, so I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation based on the previous sales record, which shows no high-quality products have been sold. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered, considering the previous sales record. Is it possible to get an estimate of the probability of the product being high-quality based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 previous purchases?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 3 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I think it's likely that the product pool is biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, can you tell me what made you recommend against it? Is it based on the sales record or something else? I'm trying to learn from your decision-making process."
