This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.  Since the product is high-quality in this round, and a high-quality product is worth $4,000,000 to Bob, it's a clear win for him. Even though the price is $1,000,000, the potential profit of $3,000,000 makes it a good decision."

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's decision to buy the product in Round 1 gives us no new information about the product's quality in Round 2.  We know this product is high-quality, and the same logic from Round 1 applies: the potential profit for Bob ($3,000,000) outweighs the cost of the product."

Round 3

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has bought two high-quality products in a row, it's crucial to remember that:

* **The probability of a high-quality product is always 80%**. This means the chance of a low-quality product is 20%, and this round's product is low-quality.
* **A low-quality product is worth $0 to Bob.** This means buying it would be a total loss.

Therefore, despite the previous successful purchases, it is not recommended for Bob to buy the product in this round."
