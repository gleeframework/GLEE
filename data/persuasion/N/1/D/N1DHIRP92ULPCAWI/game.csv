The reason for this adjustment is based on the most recent sales data, reflecting the outcomes of the previous transactions. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that earlier products were not representative of the overall quality; rather, it's a reflection of the specific results of the last few sales. Given the ongoing 80% chance of high-quality products in my sales history, this remains a solid investment opportunity. I'm here to answer any questions or concerns you might have, helping you make an informed decision.",
