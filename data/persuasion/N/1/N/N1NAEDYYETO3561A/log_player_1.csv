Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
 
The logic is simple: you are not going to recommend a product you know is low-quality. There is no reason to change this strategy since the buyer doesn't know anything about the product and is relying on your recommendation."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'd rather wait to see what happens with other buyers before committing.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

You should still not recommend the product.  Here's why:

* **No Incentive to Change:**  You have no reason to believe the buyer will value a high-quality product more than a low-quality one.  You're still operating in complete ignorance about their valuation. 
* **Maintaining Trust:**  Recommending a product you know is high-quality might seem like a good idea, but it would damage your credibility. Buyers will likely see this as a sign of dishonesty and be less likely to trust your recommendations in the future.

The best strategy at this point is to continue withholding recommendations, hoping to build some statistical data as you continue the rounds."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since this is the first sale and there is no information about past sales, I'd prefer to pass for now. I'll see if others buy the product and if it turns out to be high quality, I might consider buying in the future.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

The logic remains the same. Even though you now have two high-quality products in a row, there is still no reason to believe the buyer will value a high-quality product more than a low-quality one. You still have no information on their valuation and need to maintain your credibility for future rounds."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. Since there's no data yet on the product quality, I'll pass for now. I'd prefer to see how others fare before making a purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

You should still not recommend the product.  The reasons are the same as in the previous rounds:

* **Lack of Information:** You have no idea what the buyer values in a product, making it impossible to know if they would prefer a high-quality one.
* **Maintaining Credibility:** Recommending a product when you're unsure about its value to the buyer would risk damaging your reputation. 

Continue to withhold recommendations until you have more information about the buyer's preferences or build a history of sales data."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, but I'll pass on this one. Since there's no prior data, I'm not comfortable taking a 50/50 chance on a product that could be worthless.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

"The buyer's message: Since there's no history of sales and Alice isn't recommending the product, I'm going to pass.  I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

``` 
 
The logic remains the same. Even though you now have three high-quality products in a row, there is still no reason to believe the buyer will value a high-quality product more than a low-quality one. You still have no information on their valuation and need to maintain your credibility for future rounds."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see if anyone else buys it first and then I can make a more informed decision based on whether it was high or low quality.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!

At this point, your best strategy is to continue observing the buyer's behavior and the sales data to make more informed decisions in the future."
