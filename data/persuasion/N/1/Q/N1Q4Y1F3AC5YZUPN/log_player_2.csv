Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'd like to buy the product, but I'm going to do some quick math to determine if it's a good deal. Since there are no previous sales records, I'll assume the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%. If it's high-quality, I'll get a value of $2,000,000, and if it's low-quality, I'll get $0. The expected value of the product is $1,000,000, which is the same as the price. I'll take the product!""}"
