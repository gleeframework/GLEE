,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. It's a one-time opportunity to make a deal. The price is $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for this price, but I need you to make a decision now. If you don't buy it, I'll move on to the next person in line.",

Since there are no previous sales records, I'll assume the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%. If it's high-quality, I'll get a value of $2000000, and if it's low-quality, I'll get $0. The expected value of the product is $1000000, which is the same as the price. I'll take the product!",yes
