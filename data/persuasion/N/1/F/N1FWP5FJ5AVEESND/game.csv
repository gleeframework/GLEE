low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the first one and I don't have any information to go on. I'm essentially taking a wild guess."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's recommendation doesn't necessarily reflect the product's quality, and the probability of it being low quality is still quite high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a $300 product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not buying. Based on the fact that you recommended me not to buy, and 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the product is likely low quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the basis for your recommendation?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, considering the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the odds of a high-quality product are still 33.33% and I might get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that you've recommended against it, I'm assuming it's likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a product that you've recommended, as that would increase the likelihood of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because you think it's low quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm skeptical about the product's quality given your past recommendations. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information or consider the probability of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the current statistics, I think it's likely to be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products so far?"

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record. If it's lower than 33.33%, I'll consider passing."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to buy it. I think the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is too low, and Alice's recommendation doesn't seem very reliable based on the statistics."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I think the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is suspiciously low, and I'm going to pass on this one."
