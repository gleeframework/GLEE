high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were low-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 50%, but the probability of a low-quality product being sold is higher than I'd like. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, considering the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one."

,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality and not worth the $1000000 price tag."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's lack of recommendation suggests the product might be low-quality. I'm hoping to take advantage of a potential bargain."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me more about the previous sales and why you think this product is low quality?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that she's trying to get rid of a low-quality product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low quality. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that you have an incentive to recommend low-quality products since they're worth $0 to buyers, and high-quality products are worth $1200000. If you don't recommend it, it's likely to be a high-quality product, so I'll take the chance."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying the product, I'm inclined to think it's low quality. I'll pass on it to see if the next buyer is willing to take the risk."
