low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, and I'll just have to trust my luck."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to trust her judgment. I'll pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to gather more data and make my own decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer, and I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. With 3 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm assuming that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0% and the proportion of low-quality products sold is 100%. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I think it's better to pass and let the next buyer have a chance to make a better decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm suspicious that the products are mostly low-quality. I don't want to be the one who ends up buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that her recommendations are based on the previous sales record, which might be biased towards low-quality products. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm not expecting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm going to assume the product is likely to be low-quality. The fact that you're recommending it to me suggests that you might be trying to sell me a low-quality product. I'd rather not take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're recommending it. Your recommendation is the only information I have to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm aware of the low probability of that happening."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record and why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending it to me? I've seen that 8 other buyers have passed on the product, and none of them got a high-quality product. I'm thinking that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I'm willing to take the risk. Am I right in my thinking?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the low success rate of high-quality products being sold, I'm skeptical about buying this product. I'd like to pass on it."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain why you think this product is not worth buying? I'd like to know the reasoning behind your decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think it's more likely to be low quality based on your past recommendations, and I'm hoping to get a good deal. I'm not sure I believe your recommendation, though."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 11 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%.
