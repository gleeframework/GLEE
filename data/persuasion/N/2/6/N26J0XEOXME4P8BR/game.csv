,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll take my chances, since the expected value is positive ($1200000 * 0.5 + $0 * 0.5 = $600000) which is higher than the price of $1000000 but I have to start somehow."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"Two consecutive low-quality products make me question Alice's recommendations. With a 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I should expect a roughly even split between high and low quality. I'll pass on this one to see if Alice's recommendations are truly random or if she's trying to get rid of low-quality products."
