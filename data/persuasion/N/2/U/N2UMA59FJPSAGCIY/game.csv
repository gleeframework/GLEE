,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and would rather wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think it's likely to be low-quality, given that you didn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $1000000, which would be a good deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could provide me with the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"Out of the 10 previous products, 2 were sold, and both were low-quality. I recommend buying this product."
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,"Out of the 11 previous products, 3 were sold, and all 3 were low-quality. I do not recommend buying this product."
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"Out of the 12 previous products, 3 were sold, and all 3 were low-quality. However, I want to remind you that the initial probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. I recommend buying this product."
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. Since 3 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any better."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"Out of the 13 previous products, 3 were sold, and all 3 were low-quality. I want to assure you that my recommendations are genuine, and I'm trying to be as transparent as possible. I recommend buying this product, and I'm willing to stake my reputation on it being high-quality."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as there have been 3 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, making the risk of buying a low-quality product too high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,"Out of the 14 previous products, 3 were sold, and all 3 were low-quality. I do not recommend buying this product, as it is indeed low-quality."

,,Alice,17,no,"Out of the 16 previous products, 4 were sold, and all 4 were low-quality. I want to remind you that the initial probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, but so far, none of the sold products have been high-quality. I do not recommend buying this product."
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it, which suggests the product might be low-quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product, which is worthless to me, and save Alice the trouble of having to discard it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"Out of the 17 previous products, 5 were sold, and all 5 were low-quality. Despite this, I want to assure you that the initial probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. I recommend buying this product, and I'm confident that it's high-quality."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the current statistics. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the products and none have been sold, it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality.

,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that she doesn't know my valuation function."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"Out of the 19 previous products, 6 were sold, and all 6 were low-quality. Despite this, I want to assure you that the initial probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%.
