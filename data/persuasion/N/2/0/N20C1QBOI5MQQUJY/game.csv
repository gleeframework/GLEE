high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on the seller's past sales record, and the recommendation is not helpful to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the outcome of its quality, so I can make a more informed decision for future products."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that it's high quality based on the prior probability of 80.00%"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the limited data, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the lack of information from your previous recommendation. I'm hoping that the probability of the product being high quality is still 80%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2 purchases, it's possible that Alice's recommendation is just a guess or based on some other factor. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, as well as the total number of products sold, before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data on the quality of the products before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I would like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the relatively low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information about the products that were sold previously."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I want to see more data before making a purchase. With only 2 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, it seems like the probability of the product being low-quality is still relatively high. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is sold."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that Alice's recommendation may be influenced by her not knowing my valuation. Can you provide more information about the previous buyers and their decisions?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I would like to pass on the product. I'd like to know why you recommended it, and I'd like to see the updated statistics before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the low number of sales and the fact that 1 out of 4 previous buyers passed on the product despite Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd also like to know the overall proportion of high-quality products sold out of all products sold so far, and the number of products sold so far."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 4/5, which is higher than the true probability of 0.8. This suggests that the sample may be biased towards high-quality products, and I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 5 products sold were high-quality, which is a higher proportion than the 80% probability of a product being high-quality. This suggests that the remaining products may be more likely to be low-quality, so I'd like to pass."
