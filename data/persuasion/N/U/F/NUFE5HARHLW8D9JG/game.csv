I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to negotiate the price to $9500. I believe the lower price reflects the lower probability of it being high-quality.",yes

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I see what you're getting at! You're right, the proportion of high-quality products sold should be higher than the probability of getting a high-quality product. That's because the probability is based on the total number of products sold, while the proportion is based on the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold. In this case, the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%, but the proportion of high-quality products sold is 75% because 2 out of the 8 products sold were low-quality. I hope that clears up any confusion! I'm happy to offer you this product, which is also a high-quality one, at the same price of $10000.
