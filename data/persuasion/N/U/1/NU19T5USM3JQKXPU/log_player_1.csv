"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality in this round, and the buyer has no information about the product, the best strategy is to recommend buying.  The buyer knows the general probability of a high-quality product (33.33%), so there's a good chance they will find the offer appealing, especially since they have no information about the specific product to go against this probability."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first sale and there's no data to go on, I'm willing to take a chance based on Alice's recommendation.  Let's buy it!
The buyer bought the product!

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer has now seen one sale and knows it was a high-quality product. This reinforces their perception that you are more likely to sell high-quality products than the general probability suggests.  Even with a small sample size, this positive experience should make them more inclined to buy again. It's still a gamble, but the odds are slightly in their favor now."

The buyer bought the product!

```

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation.  You have two successful sales of high-quality products, which might make a buyer more likely to trust your recommendation.  However, this round's product is low-quality. Recommending it would damage your credibility.  It's better to err on the side of caution and not recommend this product.  You can try to build back trust with future high-quality products."

```

**Explanation:**

Even though the last product was low-quality, you have a 2/3 success rate overall. This is significantly higher than the general probability of 33.33%. The buyer knows this and might be more cautious now, but a high-quality product should still be attractive. Recommending this product might help rebuild trust and remind the buyer of your higher-than-average success rate."
"The buyer's message: Alice, your recommendation is convincing!  I trust your judgment based on the data that 100% of the recommended products have been high quality. I'll take it!

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Given your recommendation and the fact that all 3 previous buyers who purchased the product received high-quality items, it seems like the odds are stacked against me. I will pass on this product.

You've already demonstrated that you're willing to be truthful with your recommendations (by not recommending the low-quality product in the previous two rounds), and the buyers have shown they trust your judgment.  Continuing to recommend low-quality products will lead to distrust and ultimately, fewer sales. It's crucial to prioritize maintaining your credibility and build trust with buyers."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty, but I will pass on this product. Based on your recommendation and the sales history, it seems like the odds are not in my favor. I wish you luck with the next buyer!
