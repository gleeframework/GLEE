Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the buyer in Round 1 bought the low-quality product for $1,000,000, I can infer that this buyer's valuation for a low-quality product is at least $1,000,000. 

Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the buyer doesn't know the quality of the product, they will only buy if they think the expected value of the product is higher than $1,000,000. 

Given that the product is low-quality, I will recommend the buyer to buy it.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product, based on the recommendation.
