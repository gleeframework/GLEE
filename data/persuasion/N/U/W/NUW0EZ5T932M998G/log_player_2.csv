  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample. If she's recommending against the product, it's likely that all the previous 3 buyers got low-quality products, which would mean that the proportion of high-quality products in the sample is 0. But since the true probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's likely that the true proportion is higher than 0. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.""
