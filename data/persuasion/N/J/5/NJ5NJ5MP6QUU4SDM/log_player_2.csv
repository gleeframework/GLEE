**Reasoning:**

* **High Selling Rate:**  The sales record shows that 4 out of 4 products sold were high quality. This indicates a strong likelihood that the current product is also high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation to buy further strengthens the case for the product being high quality, as she knows the true value of each product.
* **Potential Profit:**  Even with the risk of the product being low quality, the potential profit of $120 outweighs the potential loss of $0.  

While there's still a chance the product is low quality, the information available strongly suggests it's worth taking the risk."
