,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product and let you know that I'm doing this based on the lack of information and the random nature of the product's quality. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's only worth $0 to me.

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the initial statistics, and I'd like to see the product before making a decision.

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low-quality. This suggests a high likelihood that the product you recommend is low-quality. I'll pass and let you discard it."
