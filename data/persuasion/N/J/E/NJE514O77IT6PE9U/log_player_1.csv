Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

**Reasoning:**

Since this is the first round, there's no information about the seller's past performance. The buyer knows the product has a 50% chance of being high-quality. Therefore, in this round, the buyer should be willing to take the risk since the potential benefit of buying a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first product and there's no data to go on, I'm willing to take a chance based on your recommendation. I'll buy it.

The buyer knows the seller has a 50% chance of offering a high-quality product, but they also know that the current product is low-quality. The buyer has no reason to believe the seller is offering a good deal this time, especially after the previous round where the buyer took a chance."
