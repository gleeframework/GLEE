**Reasoning:**

While the odds are still against you (66.67% chance of low quality), there's a crucial piece of information: Alice's recommendation. 

* **Alice knows the product's quality.** This means her recommendation holds significant weight. 
* **Alice's recommendation is in her own best interest.**  She benefits from selling products, even low-quality ones.  

Therefore, Alice recommending the product strongly suggests it's likely high quality.  The 1:1 ratio of high-quality products sold also supports this. While it's still a gamble, the odds are significantly in your favor with Alice's recommendation."

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous sales data:** The previous sales data shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products.  While this is a small sample size, it's a strong indicator that Alice's recommendations are reliable.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, knowing the product's quality, has recommended buying it. This is a significant signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low quality, the potential loss is $100. However, the potential gain is $20 (the difference between the product's worth and the price). The potential reward outweighs the potential risk.

**Important note:** This decision is based on the provided information and the assumption that Alice is acting in her own best interest."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Sale Rate of High-Quality Products:**  The fact that 7 out of 7 products sold were high quality is a strong indicator that Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality, recommends buying the product. This further strengthens the belief that the current product is likely high quality. 
* **Potential Gains:** Even with a 66.67% chance of being low quality, the potential gain of $120 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100 for a low-quality product. 

While there is still a risk involved, the available information points strongly towards the product being high quality, making it a worthwhile gamble."
