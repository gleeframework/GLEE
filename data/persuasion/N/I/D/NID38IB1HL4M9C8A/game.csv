,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sale. Can you provide that?

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is 80.00% and the probability of a low-quality product is 20.00%. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm skeptical and want to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of it being high-quality seems relatively high based on the current statistics."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she knows how much I value the product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
