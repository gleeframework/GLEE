low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she knows the product is low quality. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, but I'm hoping it's high quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that if you recommend a product, it's likely to be low quality, given that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation doesn't influence my decision. I'll buy it based on my own calculation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'll assume the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, since Alice's recommendation is against buying, I'll take that into account and decide to buy with a slight hesitation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see for myself whether it's high or low quality."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to know if you have any information about the previous buyers' decision-making processes or any other relevant data that might help me make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. Given the statistics, I think it's likely that the product is low quality, but I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm going to pass on this one. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and I don't want to risk wasting $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm going to take a chance and hope for the best!"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to ask, what's the basis for your recommendation? Is it based on the sales record or something else?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and all of them were low-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product and 6 out of 6 previous buyers have also not purchased, I'm inclined to think that all previous products were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that the current product is also low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of the 6 previous purchases, and the fact that you recommended me to buy it, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if I can get a better idea of the product's quality based on the updated statistics."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 out of 7 products sold so far were low-quality, I'm going to assume the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than the stated 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
