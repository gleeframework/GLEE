low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 2 so far, so the probability of this product being high-quality is still 0%. This is my second low-quality product in a row, which might be a coincidence, but it could also indicate a problem with my sales. Would you like to take a chance?",

Would you like to take the chance and buy this product?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing so based on the 33.33% chance of it being high-quality, and I'm prepared to walk away if it's low-quality.",yes
