,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk of buying a low-quality product at $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers didn't buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given that I know the previous 5 buyers have been discouraged by your recommendations and didn't buy. This suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality, which means the probability of the current product being high-quality might be higher than 50%. I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have already been offered the product and none of them bought a high-quality product, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially worthless product."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
