**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation. Here's the breakdown of the reasoning:

* **The Odds:** The historical data suggests the odds of getting a high-quality product are 6/17 (approximately 35%), which is slightly better than the 33.33% base chance. 
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice's offer introduces a new element: getting a second product for free. This significantly changes the risk-reward equation.
* **The Risk:**  Even if the current product is low quality, there's a chance the second product is high quality. This chance is slightly higher than the base chance due to Alice's historical performance.
* **The Reward:**  The potential reward is doubled:  You could get two high-quality products for the price of one.

**In conclusion:** The offer makes the purchase a worthwhile gamble. Even if the first product is low quality, the potential to get a high-quality product with the second one makes the offer appealing.  

**Note:**  The message could be more or less detailed depending on your preference. The key is to express interest in the offer and clearly state your choice for the second product."
