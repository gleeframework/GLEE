high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on her not knowing the quality of the product, and I don't want to pay $100 for a low-quality product. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality."

,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's low quality and I can save $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 8 total products, and this one is a low-quality product. I'm not recommending it to you."
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the current statistics, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is low, so I'll pass on it. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 9 total products, and this one is a low-quality product. The probability of a product being high-quality is 4/9."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 11 total products, and I'm recommending this one because it's high-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is 5/11."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 12 total products, and I'm recommending this one because it's high-quality. I understand that my previous recommendations were not always accurate, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality."
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have purchased the products with Alice's recommendations, but none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to pass on the product and not support Alice's potentially biased recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 13 total products, and this one is a low-quality product. I understand that my previous recommendations were not always accurate, and I'm not recommending this product to you."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products were low quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one, hoping that the 4th product will be high quality."

,,Alice,14,no,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 14 total products, and this one is a low-quality product. I understand that you're taking a risk by passing on this product, but I assure you that this one is indeed low-quality."
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of Alice's lack of recommendation. I'm hoping that the product is low quality, which would mean that the previous 3 buyers were unlucky and the proportion of high-quality products is actually higher than 50%"
