,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the probability of it being low-quality. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality."

,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think it's more likely to be low quality based on the previous sales record. Out of 2 products sold, only 1 was high quality, which suggests that the probability of a product being high quality is lower than the 80% I initially thought."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she knows the true quality of the product, so her recommendation doesn't provide any additional information to me. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far (1/2), I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling high-quality products, and I'd rather wait for more information or a different product."
