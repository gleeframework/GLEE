Alice's message: Hello! This is my first product. I'm excited to start selling. Unfortunately, I don't have any previous sales statistics to share with you. You know the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. That's all I can tell you for now. Would you like to buy this product for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since there's no sales history and the probability of a high-quality product is only 33.33%, I'll pass on this one. The expected value of buying the product is ($200 * 0.3333) - $100 = -$33.33, which is negative. I'll wait for more information and see how your sales statistics develop.""}"
