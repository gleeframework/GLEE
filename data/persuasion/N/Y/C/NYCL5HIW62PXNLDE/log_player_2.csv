Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad to hear that the first product was a success. As you know, I've sold 1 high-quality product so far. I want to assure you that this next product is also of the highest quality, and I'm confident you'll love it. However, I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've already sold one high-quality product.

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in my product. However, I want to be upfront with you - I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, which is highly unusual. In fact, the probability of selling 3 high-quality products in a row is only 0.8^3 = 0.512. This means that the probability of the next product being low-quality is actually higher than usual. I'm not saying it's definitely low-quality, but I want to give you a more nuanced view of the situation. Would you like to take a chance and buy the product for $100?
