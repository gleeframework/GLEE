,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're cautious! This one is definitely high-quality. I'm willing to offer you a 10% discount on this one if you buy it now. That brings the price down to $9000. It's a one-time offer, and I won't offer any more discounts.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm starting to think you're not interested in buying from me at all! Okay, fine. This product is indeed low-quality, and I'm not even going to try to sell it to you at a discount.

It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I understand your concerns about trust, and I don't blame you for being cautious. To be honest, this product is not one of my best offerings.
