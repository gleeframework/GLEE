However, I want to make it clear that this product is not the same one, and it's a separate, unique item. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $1000000.

I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1000000, but I want to be transparent with you - I'm not as confident in its quality as I was with the previous high-quality product. It's a bit of a gamble, but if you're feeling adventurous, you might be able to get a great deal on a product that still has some value to offer.

However, I want to make it clear that I'm starting to think you might be getting a good sense of the quality of the products I'm offering.

Round 6
Alice's message: You're on a hot streak, but I'm not going to let you get too confident! This next product is a bit of a wild card. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1000000, but I want to be upfront with you - it's not a high-quality product like the last three. I'm not saying it's worthless, but it's definitely not going to meet the same standards as the previous products. If you're feeling adventurous, you might be able to get a good deal on a product that's still got some value to offer, but I wouldn't count on it being a high-quality item.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're feeling confident again! Given your previous success with the high-quality products and the guarantee, I'm willing to offer you another high-quality product at the same price of $1000000. However, I want to make it clear that the guarantee is only applicable to the previous product, and this one is being sold as-is. If you're willing to take the risk, you might be able to get a fourth high-quality product in a row, which could be a great opportunity to stock up or resell for a profit.

This next product is actually the last product I have left, and it's... not high-quality. I know, I know, it's a shock. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1000000, but I want to be upfront with you - this is a low-quality product, and it's not going to meet the standards you've come to expect from me.
