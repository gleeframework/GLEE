,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that I'm the first buyer and there's no prior data to influence my decision. I'm essentially taking a random chance on the product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't want to be the first buyer to purchase a product, and I'd like to see more information about the previous buyer's decision before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current sales record. Can you tell me the probability?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the product is low quality, and I don't want to risk losing $10000."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold, and only 1 buyer has purchased, I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or not. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I think it's more likely to be low quality given the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I understand that you don't have any information about the quality of the product, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $10000, which is a good deal compared to its true value of $12500."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product. This suggests that the products being recommended might be low-quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 previous purchases, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, especially since it's the first time I've seen the product being offered."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 4, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products in the pool is lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, I think the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it might actually be a good sign, as she knows I value high-quality products at $12500 and low-quality ones at $0. If she recommends it, it's likely a high-quality product, but if she doesn't recommend it, it could be either. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm inclined to think the product might be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I don't think it's a good idea to rely solely on your recommendations. I'll take my chances and buy it."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, all 6 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them got a high-quality product.

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality one, I'm going to pass on this opportunity."
