"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality, Alice should recommend Bob to buy it. The product is priced at $10,000, and even though Bob doesn't know its true worth, there's a chance it could be worth more to him than the price.  He has nothing to lose by buying it and potentially gaining a valuable product."
"Bob's message: I'm not sure about the quality, I'd like to pass for now.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob passed on the previous high-quality product, Alice should still recommend buying this one.  Here's why:

* **No information revealed:** Bob's decision to pass doesn't give Alice any new information about Bob's valuation of high-quality products.  
* **Probability remains:** The probability of this round's product being high-quality is still 33.33%, independent of the previous round. 
* **Potential gain:**  There's still a chance this product is worth more to Bob than the price, and Alice has no reason to believe otherwise."
"Bob's message: I'll take a chance this time, I think the product might be high-quality.
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob bought the product in the previous round, meaning he now has some information about how Alice operates. Even though he doesn't know the quality of this round's product, the fact that he bought a high-quality product last time suggests he might be more inclined to buy again. 

It's still a gamble for Bob, but the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Alice should recommend the purchase as there's a chance of another successful sale."
