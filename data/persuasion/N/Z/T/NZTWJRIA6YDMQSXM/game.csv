,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision before making a decision. Did they buy a high-quality product or a low-quality product?
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation, especially since none of the previous product sold was high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware of the 0/1 sales record, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, and Alice is not recommending the product. This suggests that the product is likely to be low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I will pass on the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. I'll wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as I think the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high, and I can get a great deal on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I believe that the current product is likely to be low-quality as well. I will pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you'll reveal the product's quality after my decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 5, and I'm not convinced that this product is worth the $1000000. I'd like to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm going to buy this product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk based on the statistics, which suggest that there's a 33.33% chance of it being high-quality. I'll take the chance to possibly get a $3000000 product for $1000000!"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than the given 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products Alice is offering. I'd like to know more about the products before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'd like to buy the product"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 7 buyers all bought the products despite your recommendations. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold, it seems like your recommendations are not reliable. I'll take a chance and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of 7 purchases, I'd like to calculate the probability of the product being high quality, which would be 1 - (number of low-quality products sold / total number of products sold). However, since we don't know the number of low-quality products sold, I'll assume it's all 7. Therefore, the probability of the product being high quality is 1 - 7/7 = 0. So, I'll pass on the product."
