,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 80.00%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the recommendation for the next buyer, so I can get a better sense of the probability of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the quality of the product first before making a decision, but since you recommended it, I'm a bit skeptical."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the statistics."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 products sold were high-quality. However, the probability of a product being high-quality is 80.00%, so I'm not convinced that the product I'm being offered is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics you have so far.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given the previous sales record."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which is a 66.67% success rate. This is lower than the 80.00% probability of a product being high-quality. I would like to pass on the product and wait for more data to become available."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I want to observe the outcome of the next product before making a decision, as the current recommendation from Alice is not very informative given the limited number of sales."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. What's the probability of the next product being high quality based on the previous sales?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the probability of it being high quality, not your recommendation."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'm aware that there's a 20% chance it could be low quality. I'm hoping it's the 3rd high-quality product in a row."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a clear explanation for your previous recommendations, and I'd like to know the total number of products you've sold so far."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she doesn't know the product's quality and is trying to maximize her sales, so it's likely that she's recommending a low-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality given that 3 high-quality products have been sold out of 6 purchases?"

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision.
