,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision, and the fact that you recommended it doesn't change my probability assessment of the product being high or low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she's seen 3 previous sales, and the fact that the first product sold was high-quality might make her more likely to recommend the current product, even if it's low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is recommended."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/6, which is less than the expected 0.5. This suggests that the true proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 0.5, making the product more likely to be low-quality. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
