,,Alice,2,"I understand your caution, Bob. I'll give you a bit more context. I've had a few customers who were initially hesitant, but ended up being very happy with this product. However, I have to be upfront with you, this one is a bit of a risk. It's a $100 product, but I'm willing to let you try it out and see for yourself. I'm not making any promises, but I think it's worth a shot.",

That way, you can be absolutely sure you're getting a high-quality item. The price remains the same at $100, but I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you took a chance on the last one, Bob! Unfortunately, this one is not quite as fortunate. I want to be upfront with you - this product has some issues and I wouldn't recommend it to my best friend. I'm not trying to sell it to you because I think it's a good deal, but because I need to clear out some inventory. I'll give you a straight shot: this one is not a good investment. I'd advise you to pass on it and wait for a better opportunity.",

It's a complete loss for me, but I'd rather get rid of it than let it go to waste.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the extreme discount, Alice, but even at $0, I'm not interested in taking on a product that you've repeatedly warned me is low-quality. The potential gift isn't enough to sway me, and I'd rather not take on the risk of dealing with a potentially worthless product.",no
