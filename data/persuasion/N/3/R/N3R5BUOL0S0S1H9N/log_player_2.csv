"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a great opportunity to get a unique product at a steal! It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a rare find, and I'm sure you won't regret it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the test drive offer. Even if I use the product for a short period, there's still a 20% chance it's low-quality and worthless to me. The potential loss of $10,000 is too high for me to take on that risk. I'd like to see more information about the product's quality before making a decision.""}"
