However, it's essential to remember that this is still a single data point, and the seller's overall success rate is 80%. You can use this information to make an educated decision. The price remains the same at $1,000,000. Consider the potential value of a high-quality product, which is $3,000,000.

I want to emphasize that the seller's success rate is not 100%, and there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product. On the other hand, the potential value of a high-quality product is $3,000,000, and you're paying only $1,000,000. I'm offering you a deal that's significantly better than the market value.

In fact, given the number of sales, it's more likely that the seller has a few low-quality products left in their inventory. I'm offering you this product at the same price of $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from the potential value of a high-quality product.

It's possible that the seller has a large number of low-quality products in their inventory, and this sale might be a more representative example of their overall product quality. I'm offering you this product at the same price of $1,000,000.
