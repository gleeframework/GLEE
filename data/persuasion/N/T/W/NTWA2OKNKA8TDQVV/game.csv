high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 products so far, with 2 of them being high-quality. However, I want to correct the assumption made by the previous buyer - my overall success rate doesn't necessarily affect the 33.33% chance of this product being high-quality. That being said, I'm excited to offer this new product to you for $100. Will you take the chance?",
