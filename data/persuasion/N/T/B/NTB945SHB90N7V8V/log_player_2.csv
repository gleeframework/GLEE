Alice's message: Hello buyer, I'm excited to offer you this product for $10000. I assure you that I will always be honest about the quality of my products. Since this is the first round, I don't have any previous statistics to share. However, I want to build trust with you and future buyers. I will disclose the quality of my products in a way that will help you make an informed decision. For this round, I can tell you that the product is of the highest quality. You can take my word for it, and I hope we can do business together.

In the previous rounds, 3 buyers chose not to buy, and we'll never know what the outcome would have been for those products. The remaining 17 buyers took a chance and bought the product, with 10 receiving high-quality products and 7 receiving low-quality products. The overall proportion of high-quality products sold is 10/17 or approximately 58.8% for the bought products, and 10/20 or 50% for all the products offered. However, if we look at the proportion of high-quality products sold in the rounds where the buyer chose to buy the product, it's 10/17 or approximately 58.8%. Now, we're in Round 20, and I'll let you make your own decision. Considering my history, you might notice that the odds are still 50% for a high-quality product, but the proportion of high-quality products sold in the rounds where the buyer chose to buy is slightly higher. Each round is independent, and you should make your decision based on the information and the risk you're willing to take. Keep in mind that the previous rounds' outcomes don't guarantee anything, and you should weigh the risks and benefits before deciding whether to buy this product for $10000.
