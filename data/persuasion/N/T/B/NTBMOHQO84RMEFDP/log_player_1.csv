I'm willing to offer you a special deal: I'll give you a 20% discount on the product if you buy it now. The price would be $8,000. It's still a risk, but it's a slightly better deal than before.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty and the discount offer, but I'll pass on the product. Given the probability of a high-quality product remains the same and my potential loss is still significant, I don't feel the 20% discount is enough to justify the risk.

But don't let that fool you - the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'm willing to sell this one to you for the standard price of $10,000. No discounts, no negotiations.
