Here's why:

* **Trust is Key:** The buyer is already starting to build trust in you, as you've been honest so far.  Breaking that trust now would be detrimental to future sales.
* **Reputation Matters:** The buyer will likely share their experience with others. A bad experience could lead to fewer future buyers.
* **Long-Term Profit:**  While you might make a quick $10,000 now, the long-term benefits of maintaining a good reputation far outweigh the short-term gain.

The best strategy is to continue being honest and only recommend products you believe in. This will help you build a loyal customer base and ultimately lead to more sales."

* **Reputation:** A consistent track record of honesty will build credibility and make buyers more likely to trust your recommendations in the future.
