low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the product, but only because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any information to go on. I'm essentially making a blind guess."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the probability, not Alice's recommendation. I know the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given that no high-quality products have been sold so far and Alice's recommendation is not based on my valuation. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your previous recommendations haven't been very helpful, so I'm going to take a chance and make my own decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the high proportion of low-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I suspect that Alice is providing recommendations based on the quality of the product, which would mean that all previous products were low quality. If that's the case, I don't want to buy this product as it's likely to be low quality as well."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product, especially since the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0 out of 4, which is lower than the expected 33.33%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards selling low-quality products, given that all previous buyers have passed on the product after her recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product, and the fact that she doesn't recommend it might be a good sign."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm taking a chance!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that since you've seen 7 buyers pass on the product, the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the initial 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not confident in buying a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the low success rate of high-quality products so far."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products, given that none of the previous 8 buyers received a high-quality product. I'd like to wait and see if Alice's recommendations change as more data becomes available."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 9 buyers have purchased products and none of them were high-quality, I think it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 9 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially worthless product."
