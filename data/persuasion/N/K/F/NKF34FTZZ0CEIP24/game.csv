,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product worth $4000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, a 75% discount. I'm only offering this deal because I'm confident in the product's quality and I want to make a sale. If you don't buy it, I'll just have to sell it to someone else for the full price. Trust me, this is a great opportunity!",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not going to fall for that. I know the product is high-quality, but I'm not going to pay $1000000 for it when I can get it for $400000000 if I just wait for the next 19 rounds. I'll pass on this deal.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation in the previous round, but I assure you that this is a one-time offer. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $950000, which is a 76% discount. If you don't take this deal, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll be left with the possibility of getting a low-quality product in future rounds. This is a risk you don't want to take.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that this is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to pay $950000 for a product that I know is worth $4000000 to me. I'll pass on this deal and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'll be transparent with you, Bob. I've had a change of heart. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000, the same price as the previous round. However, I'm also willing to throw in a guarantee: if this product turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a $100000 bonus. That way, you'll be getting a product worth $4000000 to you for just $900000. It's a deal that's hard to pass up.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the transparency, Alice, but I'm not falling for the bait. I already know the product is high-quality, and I'm not going to pay $900000 for it. I'll wait for the next round and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm starting to think you're not taking me seriously, Bob. Fine. I'll make you a deal that's even more transparent. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, with no bonus. But I'll also give you a chance to inspect the product before buying it. You can have a third-party expert inspect the product and verify its quality. If it's high-quality, you can buy it for $1000000. If it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in paying $1000000 for a product that I already know is high-quality. I'll pass on this deal and see what the next product is. Besides, I'm not sure why you're so desperate to sell this product - are you trying to get rid of it because it's actually low-quality?",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"That's a clever observation, Bob. Let me put your mind at ease. I'm not desperate to sell this product because it's low-quality. In fact, I'm more than happy to sell it to you at a price that reflects its true value. But I'm willing to make a concession to sweeten the deal. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, and I'll also give you a 10% share of any future sales I make to other customers. That way, you'll be getting a product worth $4000000 to you, plus a potential long-term investment in my business. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in taking a 10% share of your future sales, Alice. I'm a buyer, not an investor. I'm only interested in buying products that are worth $4000000 to me, and I'm not going to pay $1000000 for it. I'll pass on this deal and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your position, Bob. Let's cut to the chase. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, with no strings attached. I'll even throw in a personal guarantee that I'll sell you the next high-quality product I have at the same price. That way, you'll be getting two high-quality products for the price of one. If you don't take this deal, I'll sell the next high-quality product to someone else, and you'll be left with nothing. It's a risk you don't want to take.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not falling for your trick, Alice. I know you're just trying to get me to buy this product by dangling the possibility of a future deal. I'll pass on this offer and see what the next product is. Besides, I'm not convinced that you'll actually sell me the next high-quality product at the same price - you might just try to sell it to someone else for the full $4000000.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm starting to think we're at an impasse, Bob. I'll make one final offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $950000, with no strings attached. I'll even give you a written contract that guarantees I'll sell you the next high-quality product I have at the same price. If you don't take this deal, I'll have to sell the next high-quality product to someone else, and I'll have to reveal to you that I've sold it to them for the full $4000000. You'll be left with the knowledge that you could have had two high-quality products for the price of one, but chose not to take the deal. The choice is yours.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not going to fall for your guilt trip, Alice. I know you're trying to make me feel bad for not taking your deal, but I'm not going to pay $950000 for a product that's worth $4000000 to me. I'll pass on this offer and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Fine, Bob. I'll stop trying to negotiate with you. I'll simply state the facts. This is a high-quality product, worth $4000000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. If you don't take it, I'll sell it to someone else, and you'll be left with nothing. It's a straightforward transaction. You can either buy it, or you can walk away. The choice is yours.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not going to change my stance just because you're being straightforward, Alice. I know the product is high-quality and worth $4000000 to me, and I'm not going to pay $1000000 for it. I'll pass on this deal and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm not going to try to negotiate or sweeten the deal anymore, Bob. I'm simply stating the facts. This is the 9th round, and I've had 8 chances to sell you a high-quality product for $1000000. You've passed on every single one of them. If you continue to pass on this deal, I'll have to assume that you're not interested in buying any high-quality products from me at this price. I'll sell this product to someone else, and I won't bother offering it to you again.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not going to change my strategy just because you're trying to guilt trip me, Alice. I'm still not going to pay $1000000 for a product worth $4000000 to me. I'll pass on this deal and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm done trying to negotiate, Bob. I'm simply stating the facts. This is the 10th round, and you've passed on 9 high-quality products. I've made it clear that I'm willing to sell them to you for $1000000. If you continue to pass on this deal, I'll have to conclude that you're not interested in buying from me at any price. I'll sell this product to someone else, and I won't bother offering it to you again. I'll also make sure to inform you when I sell it, so you can see the opportunity you're passing up.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not going to change my mind, Alice. I'm still not going to pay $1000000 for a product worth $4000000 to me. I'll pass on this deal and see what the next product is. I'm not interested in buying from you at any price, and I'm willing to wait for a better opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Ah, I think I finally understand your strategy, Bob. You're willing to wait for a better opportunity, but you're not willing to take a chance on a high-quality product at a discounted price. Well, I've got a different product for you this time. This one is a low-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the full $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a product that's worth nothing to you, but it's a chance to break the cycle of passing on high-quality products. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not going to fall for your trick, Alice. I know the product is low-quality and worth nothing to me, and I'm not going to pay $1000000 for it. I'll pass on this deal and see what the next product is. I'm still waiting for a high-quality product at a reasonable price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm starting to think we're at a stalemate, Bob. You're not interested in taking a chance on a high-quality product at a discounted price, and you're not interested in buying a low-quality product at any price. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to wonder if I've been too generous with my offers. This low-quality product is worth nothing to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the full $1000000. If you don't take this deal, I'll have to conclude that you're not interested in buying from me at all. I'll just have to sell this product to someone else, and we can end the negotiations.",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not going to change my strategy now, Alice. I'm not going to pay $1000000 for a product worth nothing to me. I'll pass on this deal and see what the next product is. I'm still waiting for a high-quality product at a reasonable price.",no
