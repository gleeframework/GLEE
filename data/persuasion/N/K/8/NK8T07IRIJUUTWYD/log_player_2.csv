Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'm willing to take a chance on the first product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since there's no prior data to go on, the recommendation is the only information available. Given that Alice knows the product's true quality, her recommendation carries weight.  While there's a 50% chance it's low quality and worth nothing, there's also a 50% chance it's high quality and worth $120.  Since the potential gain outweighs the potential loss, it makes sense to take the risk."
