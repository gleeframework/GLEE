,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I'm the first one and I don't have any information to go on. I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a potentially low-quality product for $10000 when I could potentially buy a high-quality product for $10000 later.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this product to see if the next one is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. If it's still 0, I'd like to buy the product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also passed on the product, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is likely based on the product being low quality and Alice wants to get rid of it quickly. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know how you came up with the recommendation. Was it based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the previous buyer's decision might have been influenced by Alice's recommendation, which could have been based on the product's quality. I'm hoping to get a better deal by buying the product, even if it's low quality, since it's my only chance to buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the product's quality is unknown, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered, based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous three buyers purchased the products, and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality. I'm going to pass on this product as well."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's lack of recommendation makes me think it might be a high-quality product, given the low sales record so far."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as there have been 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
