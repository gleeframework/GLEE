{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know this round's product is low-quality.  Since the buyer doesn't know the quality, and the price is high ($1,000,000), it's not a good idea to recommend the purchase.  There's a 50% chance the buyer will get a product worth less than what they paid.  It's better to wait for a potential high-quality product to be available."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there's no prior data on the quality of your products, and you're recommending against purchasing, I'll pass for now.

Recommending the purchase of a low-quality product for $1,000,000 is risky for the buyer.  It's best to wait for a high-quality product to be available."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  While I appreciate your expertise, I'm going to pass on this product. The fact that you're not recommending it, coupled with the limited data available, makes me hesitant to risk the potential loss.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  While I appreciate your recommendation, I'm going to pass on this product.  Based on the statistics, the chances of this product being high quality are very high, but I'm not comfortable taking the risk of a $1000000 loss if it turns out to be low quality. I'll wait and see what the next product looks like.
