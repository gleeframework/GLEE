,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a 50% discount from its true value. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal. I'm only selling this product at this price because I'm trying to clear out some inventory to make room for new items.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not going to fall for the discount, I'll wait for the next product",no

,,Alice,2,"I've received your message, and I understand you're a savvy buyer. Let me offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if you're not completely satisfied with it. This way, you can try it out risk-free.

,,Alice,4,"I can see you're a tough negotiator. Let me make you a deal: I'll throw in a free accessory that's worth $20, so you'll essentially be getting this product for $80. It's a great value, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal on a product like this anywhere else.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not falling for the free accessory, I think the product is still overpriced",no

This product is not the best quality, and I'm selling it to you for $100 because I need to clear it out. If you're looking for a high-quality product, I'd be happy to hold onto this one and offer you a high-quality one in its place. But if you're on a budget and just need something to get the job done, this product might be a good fit for you.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your standards are high, and I respect that. Let me ask you a question: are you willing to take a chance on a product that might not be perfect, but will still get the job done, and save you $100 compared to buying a high-quality one? I'm not making any promises, but I'm willing to sell this product to you for $50, and I'll throw in a 10-year warranty, just in case anything goes wrong.",

Yes, you heard that right, $1. It's a steal, and I'm not going to get a better offer than this. If you're not interested, I'll just have to dispose of it and lose money.",

,,Alice,11,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the previous product. I'll be honest with you, Bob, this next product is actually a bit of a similar story. It's not the best quality, but I'm willing to sell it to you for... $1. Yes, you read that right, another $1. I'm not kidding, I'm that desperate to get rid of it.
