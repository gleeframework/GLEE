**Explanation:**

* **Previous data:**  We know one buyer before us purchased a product and it was high quality. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which suggests she believes it's high quality.
* **Risk assessment:** While the product has a 2/3 chance of being low quality, the previous sale of a high-quality product gives us a bit more confidence. Plus, Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the potential for a high-quality product.
* **Decision:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($400) outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0). We decide to buy."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows that 100% of the products sold were high-quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has access to the true quality of the product, is recommending you buy it. This strongly suggests the current product is high-quality.

While there's still a chance the product is low-quality, the evidence overwhelmingly points to it being high-quality. The potential reward of $400 far outweighs the risk of $0, making it a good decision to buy."
