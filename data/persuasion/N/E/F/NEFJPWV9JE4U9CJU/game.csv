low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since I'm the first buyer and I don't have any prior information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that Alice's recommendation is against it. I'll take that as a hint, but I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because I don't have any information to go on. I'm essentially flipping a coin."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/3, but I think this is due to chance. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it might be a high-quality one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 4 previous sales, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the expected 33.33%. This suggests that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as you don't recommend it. With 4 buyers having purchased and no high-quality products sold, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is low. I'll wait for the next one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers bought a high-quality product, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to see more data or a different recommendation from Alice."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still 33.33%. Given Alice's recommendation, I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product and observe more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll buy it anyway."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 5 buyers didn't find the product valuable, but I'm willing to take the risk of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation before making a purchase."
