Alice's message: You're aware that I've sold two products now, one of which was high-quality. Given the 50% chance of high-quality products, it's likely that I have a decent number of high-quality products left. However, I'll be upfront with you: I've sold two products, and you don't know which one was the high-quality one. That means I could have sold the high-quality product already, and you'd be buying a low-quality one. But, I'll give you a hint: if I had sold the high-quality product already, I wouldn't be offering this one to you at $10000. It's a risk, but it could be a great reward. What do you think?

It's possible that I'm just getting unlucky, but it's also possible that I've sold most of my high-quality products already. I'll give you a deal that's hard to refuse: buy this product, and if it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund... but if it's high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on the price.
