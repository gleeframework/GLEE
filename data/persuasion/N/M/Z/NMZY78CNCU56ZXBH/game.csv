,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know your reasoning for not recommending the product initially."

,,Alice,2,yes,

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 buyers have already been recommended to buy and both were low-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product being recommended is lower than the 33.33% chance of it being high-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the products after Alice's recommendation, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for the next product or get more information about the previous sales before making a decision."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, but since you don't recommend it, I'd like to pass on it. Can you tell me more about your decision-making process?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your past recommendations, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the statistics."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I know my past recommendations haven't been reliable, but I assure you that this product is high-quality. I'm willing to be transparent about my past mistakes to gain your trust."
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products were recommended and none were high-quality, I believe Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I would like to pass on this product."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. If it's less than 50%, I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'm not confident it's high-quality given the lack of sales so far.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I understand my past recommendations haven't been reliable, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I'm willing to be transparent about my past mistakes to gain your trust. Please consider the fact that I'm being honest about this product's quality."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice's recommendation is not based on any knowledge of the product's quality, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that Alice's recommendations are more likely to be for low-quality products. This makes me skeptical about the quality of the product and the recommendation. I'd like to see more information or have a chance to buy a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"I know my past recommendations haven't been reliable, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I understand if you're skeptical, but I'm willing to be transparent about my past mistakes to gain your trust. This is a genuine opportunity to purchase a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it seems like the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product, which would indicate that the product is low-quality, and then buy the next product, which would likely be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're advising me not to buy it? I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is actually higher than 33.33%. I'd like to know if you have any information that I'm not aware of."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given your recommendation and the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have also chosen not to buy. This suggests that the products being recommended to buyers are likely low-quality."
