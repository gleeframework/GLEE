Alice's message: We've sold 14 products so far, with five of them being high-quality. We're willing to share the details of our Bayesian inference with you. Our prior probability of a product being high-quality was 33.33%, as stated at the beginning. We used a binomial likelihood function to update our estimate based on the observed data. We assumed a uniform prior distribution for the probability of a product being high-quality, and we used the observed number of high-quality products (5) and the total number of products (14) to update our estimate. Our posterior distribution is a beta distribution with parameters α=6 and β=9. We're offering you the fifteenth product, which is low-quality, for $900000.

Alice's message: We've sold 15 products so far, with five of them being high-quality. We're glad you're interested in the product, and we're happy to provide you with the probability of it being high-quality based on the posterior distribution. Using the beta distribution with parameters α=6 and β=9, we can calculate the probability of a product being high-quality as follows: P(high-quality) = α / (α + β) = 6 / (6 + 9) = 0.4. However, since you've just purchased a low-quality product, we'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 0.4, given the updated data.
