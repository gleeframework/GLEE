You're taking a risk, but I'm confident that the product I have now is worth the investment.",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see you're a savvy buyer, and you're right to be cautious. I'll give you a more nuanced perspective: I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total products, which is a 75% success rate. Given this trend, it's reasonable to assume that the next product might be high-quality as well. However, I want to reiterate that the price remains $1000000, and I'm not willing to negotiate. You're taking a calculated risk, and I'm willing to let you make an informed decision.",

,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 5 total products, which is a 80% success rate. However, I want to caution you that the last product I sold was low-quality.

I'm giving you a chance to make an informed decision, but I want to make it clear that I'm not guaranteeing the quality of this product.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the risk and buy the product.
