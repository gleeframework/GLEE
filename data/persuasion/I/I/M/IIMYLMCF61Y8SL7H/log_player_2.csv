  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's high quality or low quality. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you recommended it, which means you have no information about the quality of the product, so you can't know whether it's high or low quality. Therefore, I'm assuming you're recommending it based on the overall statistics. With 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high quality is 1/3. However, since the probability of a product being high quality is 80%, I'm going to take a chance and buy it. I'm hoping that I'll get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product.""
