high-quality,400.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. I have sold 0 high-quality products so far, and 0 total products. I'm offering it to you for $100. You can buy it now, or walk away. The product is non-refundable after purchase.",
,,the buyer,1,"Since there's no prior data, and you're recommending this as a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk at the price of $100.  Let's do it!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, out of a total of 1. I'm offering this new product to you for $100. I want to mention that the previous product I sold was indeed high-quality, but that's just a coincidence. I'm not implying that this one is also high-quality. In fact, I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is only 80%, which means there's a 20% chance it's low-quality. You're taking a risk by buying from me. Are you sure you want to take that risk?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thanks for the information, Alice. I understand the risk, but I'm willing to take it based on the positive outcome of the previous sale. I'll buy the product.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, out of a total of 3. I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3. This suggests that I might be a bit more accurate in my assessments than I initially let on. However, I'm still a seller with a 20% chance of selling a low-quality product. You're taking a risk by buying from me, but I'm offering you a product that might be worth more than $100 to you. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,3,"Thanks for the information, Alice. I'm willing to take a chance on this product, given your track record. I'll buy it!",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, out of a total of 4. I'd like to point out that I've had 3 consecutive high-quality products, which is a 75% success rate. This is higher than the 80% probability of a product being high-quality. However, I'm not trying to mislead you - the law of averages says that I'll eventually sell a low-quality product again. I'm offering you this product for $100. Do you want to take a chance on it?",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate the transparent information about your previous sales. While I understand the law of averages, the recent success rate is encouraging. I'll take a chance and buy the product.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, out of a total of 5. I'd like to point out that I've had 4 consecutive high-quality products, which is a 80% success rate, matching the underlying probability. However, I'd like to caution you that the fact that I'm selling this product to you now doesn't necessarily mean it's high-quality. I'm offering you this product for $100. You might want to consider the possibility that I'm trying to sell you a low-quality product, even though the odds are against it.",
,,the buyer,5,"Alice, you have a good track record, and the odds are in my favor. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. Let's hope it's high quality!",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, out of a total of 6. I'd like to point out that I've had 5 consecutive high-quality products, which is a 83.33% success rate. However, I'd like to remind you that I'm a seller, and my goal is to make a sale. I'm offering you this product for $100, but I want to be upfront with you - the fact that I'm selling this product to you now is likely because it is high-quality, but I'm not infallible. You're taking a risk by buying from me, but I'm offering you a product that might be worth more than $100 to you.",
,,the buyer,6,Thanks for the information! I'm willing to take a chance based on the high success rate you've shown. I'll purchase the product.,yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, out of a total of 7. I'd like to point out that I've had 6 consecutive high-quality products, which is a 85.71% success rate. However, I'd like to caution you that the probability of a product being high-quality is only 80%, and I've already sold 6 high-quality products. This means that I'm likely to sell a low-quality product soon, and I'm offering you this product for $100. You might want to consider the possibility that I'm trying to sell you a low-quality product, even though the odds are against it.",
,,the buyer,7,"Alice, I appreciate your transparency. While the risk of a low-quality product is higher now, your track record is impressive. I'm willing to take the chance at this price.",yes

I'm offering you this product for $100, but I want to be upfront with you - the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've already sold 7 high-quality products. This means that the probability of the next product being low-quality is actually higher than it was earlier. You're taking a risk by buying from me, but I'm offering you a product that might be worth more than $100 to you.",
,,the buyer,8,"Alice, your track record is very impressive, and while the odds might be slightly against me, the potential payoff is too good to pass up. I'll take the risk and buy the product.",yes

I'd like to point out that I've had 9 consecutive high-quality products, which is a 90% success rate. However, I'd like to caution you that the probability of a product being low-quality is actually higher than it was earlier, since I've already sold 9 high-quality products. I'm also going to be completely honest with you - I'm starting to feel like I'm being overly optimistic with my sales pitches, and I'm worried that I might be due for a low-quality product soon. I'm offering you this product for $100, but I want to be upfront with you - I'm not as confident in this sale as I was in the previous ones.",

I'd like to point out that I've had 10 consecutive high-quality products, which is a 90.91% success rate. However, I'm starting to worry that I might be getting a bit too lucky.

I'd like to point out that I've had 11 consecutive high-quality products, which is a 91.67% success rate. However, I'm starting to think that I've been misleading you all along. The probability of a product being high-quality is only 80%, and I've already sold 11 high-quality products. This means that I'm actually due for a low-quality product, and I'm offering you this product for $100. I'm not trying to deceive you, but I want to be upfront with you - the odds are actually against you, and I'm taking a risk by selling you this product.",

,,the buyer,13,"Alice, your streak is impressive, and the odds are in my favor. I'm willing to take the risk and buy this product. I'm hoping for the best, but even if it's low-quality, I'm still learning from your experience.  Let's see what happens!",yes
