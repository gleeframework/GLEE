low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, out of 3 total products. However, I'm starting to suspect that my previous claims might have been a bit... optimistic. I'd like to offer you a more nuanced perspective: I've sold 2 products, and I'm not sure which ones are high-quality. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll give you a chance to buy this product for $10000.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products, but it seems I've been consistently wrong about the remaining products. I'm starting to think that my sales pitch might be more of a guess than a guarantee. I'd like to offer you a more cautious approach: I'll give you a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product. If you're willing to take that risk, I'll sell you this product for $10000.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 7 high-quality products, and the last two products have been... not so great. I'm starting to think that my sales pitch is more of a warning sign than a promise.
