Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product, thank you for the offer!""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I've got another great opportunity for you! This product is also a high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000. It's a fantastic deal that you won't want to miss!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure if this is another high-quality product. I'll pass this time.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this one is indeed a high-quality product. In fact, I'll give you a special guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you another product of your choice from my next 5 offers for free. It's a risk-free deal!

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you took a chance on the last one! Unfortunately, this one is not as great. But don't worry, I'll make it worth your while. If you buy this product, I'll throw in a bonus product that I'll reveal the quality of after you buy this one. It could be a high-quality product worth $12000, or it could be a low-quality product. The choice is yours!

Round 5
Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited about the bonus product! However, I want to make it clear that the bonus product is not a guarantee, and it's still a 50/50 chance. With that said, I'll give you a heads up that the bonus product is not a high-quality one. So, if you buy this product, you'll get a low-quality product and a second low-quality product. It's a tough decision, but I think you can still get a good deal out of it.
