Alice's message: You've just bought a high-quality product from me, congratulations! I've now sold 1 high-quality product and 1 low-quality product. I've sold a total of 2 products. Given the fact that the first two products were both low-quality, and the third product was high-quality, it's possible that I'm more likely to sell a low-quality product next.

The probability of a product being high-quality remains 50%. However, I'll offer you a slight discount: I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $90.

To give you a better idea of the distribution, I'll share the sequence of products I've sold: 2 low-quality, 1 high-quality, 2 low-quality, 1 high-quality, 5 low-quality.
