,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't think the recommendation is reliable given the low sample size and the fact that the first buyer bought it. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation, and I'd like to wait for more data to make a decision."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than the overall probability of 80%.

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 products. This means that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I'd expect the proportion of high-quality products to be higher than 1/3. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, so I'll pass."
