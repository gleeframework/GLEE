high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 buyers have passed on the products recommended by Alice, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the previous sales record.

,,Alice,10,no,

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the current statistics.

I'd like to make an informed decision."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous sales record, it seems that all products recommended by you have been low quality, so I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
