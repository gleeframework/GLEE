,,Alice,4,no,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have rejected the product, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not sure I should buy based on your recommendation alone, especially since none of the previous buyers bought the product and none of them were high-quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better offer."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on her not knowing the quality of the product, and her previous recommendations were likely based on the same uncertainty. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is recommended to be sold."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is based on her previous sales record, which doesn't seem to be reliable given that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you're not recommending it. If you were recommending it, I'd probably pass."

,,Alice,16,yes,

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the statistics. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also passed on the products after your recommendations, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
