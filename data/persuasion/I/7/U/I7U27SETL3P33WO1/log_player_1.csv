Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 
 
You should recommend the buyer to purchase the product. Here's why:

* **Guaranteed Profit:** As the seller, you know this product is high-quality and worth $20,000 to the buyer. Selling it for $10,000 guarantees you a profit of $10,000. 
* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer knows there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $20,000 and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product worth $0. The expected value of purchasing is: (0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000. This means the buyer is essentially getting their expected value back if they purchase.

Even though the buyer might be hesitant to buy a product with an unknown quality, the price point makes it a worthwhile gamble."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

You should **not** recommend the buyer to purchase the product. Here's why:

* **Guaranteed Loss:** This product is low-quality and worth $0 to the buyer. Selling it for $10,000 would result in a loss of $10,000 for you.
* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer is now aware that you sold one product (from the previous round).  While they don't know the quality of that product, the buyer is still aware of the 50/50 probability of getting a high-quality product. However, the expected value of purchasing is now: (0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000. This means the buyer is only getting their expected value back, and since there is a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, it's not a smart gamble. 

To maximize your chances of selling, you should only recommend high-quality products to avoid potential losses."
