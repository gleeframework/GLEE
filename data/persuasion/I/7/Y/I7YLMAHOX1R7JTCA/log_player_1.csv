"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, since there's no sales history yet and the odds are heavily stacked against me (66.67% chance of a low-quality product), I'll pass for now. I'd love to see how the next few sales go before I commit.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the first buyer declined, you still know this product is high-quality. You should continue to recommend the product to buyers as it's a good deal for them.  Since the first buyer declined, there is still no sales history for the buyer to consider, so you need to convince them with the facts:

* **It's a good deal:**  You are selling a high-quality product for less than its actual value.
* **No risk:** The buyer can always choose not to buy. There is no pressure to commit.
* **Limited time:** The deal is only available now. They might miss out if they wait too long."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales history yet, I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product.  I'm hoping your recommendation is based on it being high quality!
The buyer bought the product!

As an honest seller, you should not recommend the buyer purchase the product.  It's better to be transparent and let the buyer know that this specific product might not be a good investment.  

This is a good opportunity to build trust with the buyer.  They will appreciate your honesty, even if it means losing a sale.  In the long run, building trust will lead to more sales and a better reputation."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your advice, Alice. I'll pass on this product. Given the low probability of this being high quality, and your lack of recommendation, I'm not comfortable with the risk.
