high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, I'm inclined to believe that the current product is also low-quality."
