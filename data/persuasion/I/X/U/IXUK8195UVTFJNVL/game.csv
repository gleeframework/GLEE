high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product that I'm willing to sell to you for $100. I'm confident that you'll be very satisfied with this product, and I'm offering it to you at a significantly discounted price. This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a fraction of its true value. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you at a loss, but I think it's worth it to get it into your hands.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not buying it. I'm not sure why you're selling it at such a low price, but I'm not willing to pay $100 for a product that's worth $200 to me. I'd rather wait for the next round and see what happens.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation last round, but I assure you that this product is a one-time opportunity. I'm willing to offer you a special deal on this high-quality product. If you buy it from me, I'll give you a unique serial number that guarantees you'll get a 20% discount on the next high-quality product I offer you. This way, you'll get a great deal on this product, and you'll also be setting yourself up for an even better deal on the next one.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I'm not sure why you're still trying to sell me a high-quality product at $100, and I'm not willing to buy it. I'll wait for the next round and see what happens.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I know you're skeptical, and I appreciate your patience. To be honest, I've had a change of heart about this product. I think it's not as great as I initially thought, and I'm willing to sell it to you at a low price. I'm not asking for $100, but I'll give it to you for $50. It's a great opportunity to get something for cheap, and you can always try to resell it or use it as a spare. I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not going to fall for the bait. You're trying to get rid of a high-quality product at a low price, and I'm not going to pay $50 for it. I know it's worth $200 to me, and I'm not going to settle for less than $100. I'll wait for the next round and see what happens.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I think we're getting stuck in a loop. Let me be clear: this product is not high-quality. I'm not trying to sell you a high-quality product at a low price. I'm offering you a low-quality product at a low price. It's not worth $100 to you, and it's not worth $200. It's worth $0. But I'll give it to you for $50, and you can just take it or leave it. No pressure, no strings attached.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not going to pay $50 for a product worth $0 to me. I'll just pass and see what happens in the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I get it. You're a savvy buyer. I'll make it even simpler. I'll give you this low-quality product for $0. Yes, you read that right. I'll give it to you for free. You can just take it off my hands and walk away. No obligation, no strings attached. It's a gift, really.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the generosity, but I'm not going to accept a gift that's worth $0 to me. I'll just pass and wait for the next round.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I think we've established that you're not interested in buying low-quality products, and that's perfectly fine. Let's focus on the high-quality products. This one is a gem, and I'm willing to make a concession. I'll sell it to you for $150. It's still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $200. But I'm willing to meet you halfway.",
,,Bob,6,I'm not going to pay $150 for a product that I know has a 50% chance of being low-quality. I'd be taking a risk that I'm not willing to take. I'll wait for the next round and see what happens.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns about the risk, but I want to offer you a guarantee. If you buy this high-quality product from me, I'll give you a full refund if it's not actually high-quality. That way, you'll only pay $100 if you get the good stuff, and you'll get your money back if it's not. It's a risk-free deal, and I'm confident you'll love this product.",
,,Bob,7,I'm not sure why you're trying to convince me to buy a high-quality product at $100 when I know its true value is $200. The guarantee doesn't change the fact that I'm leaving $100 on the table. I'll pass on this deal.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I think we're stuck in a loop again. Let's be clear: this product is not worth $100 to you. It's not worth $50, or even $1. It's worth $0. I'm not trying to sell you a great deal, I'm just trying to get rid of it. I'll give it to you for free, but I'll throw in a small favor: I'll give you a $5 gift card to a store you like. That's it. No strings attached.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the gift card, but I'm not going to accept a product worth $0, even with a gift card. I'll just pass and wait for the next round.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I think we've established that you're not interested in low-quality products, and that's fine. Let's focus on the high-quality ones. I'm willing to make a deal on this one. I'll sell it to you for $120, but I'll throw in a second product of your choice (either from my remaining stock) for free. You can choose any product you want, and I'll give it to you for free. It's a two-for-one deal on a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,9,I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $120 when I know its true value is $200. The free product doesn't change the fact that I'm paying $120 for a product I could get for $100. I'll pass on this deal.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I think we're at an impasse. Let me make a final offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $100, and I'll give you a 10% discount on any future purchases from me. This means that if I have another high-quality product in the future, you'll get it for $180, which is still a great deal. I'm willing to make this concession because I want to get this product into your hands, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm still not convinced. I know the product is worth $200 to me, and I'm not willing to pay $100 for it. The discount on future purchases doesn't change the fact that I'm paying full price for this one. I'll pass on this deal.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm not going to give up. I'll make one final offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $100, and I'll also give you a unique opportunity to buy the next high-quality product I have at the true value of $200. If I have another high-quality product in the future, you'll get it for $200, not $100. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it because I really want to get this product into your hands.",
,,Bob,11,"Alright, I'll take the deal. I'm willing to pay $100 for the current product, and I'll take the option to buy the next high-quality product at the true value of $200. I'm hoping that next time, I'll get a high-quality product and get a good deal.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Great decision! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Now, as promised, I have a high-quality product for you. I'll sell it to you for the true value of $200. You'll get a great deal, and I'll be happy to have found a good home for this product. Let's finalize the sale and get you the product you deserve!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Ha! I'm glad you're happy with your decision last round. Now, let's be real about this product. It's not the best, and I'm not going to try to sell it to you at a high price. I'll give it to you for free, just like last time. You can take it or leave it, but I'm not going to waste your time trying to sell you something that's not worth much.",
,,Bob,13,"I'm not going to fall for the free product trick again. I've already gotten a great deal on the previous product, and I'm not interested in taking a product worth $0 for free. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I get it. You're a savvy buyer who knows a good deal when you see one. Let's just acknowledge that this product is not worth much to you. I'll give you a genuine compliment: you've made some great decisions in our previous rounds, and I'm impressed. I'll just quietly take this product off the market and move on to the next one.",
,,Bob,14,"Thanks for the compliment, but I'm not interested in buying a product worth $0. I'll just wait for the next round and see what happens.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You're a tough negotiator, I like that. Alright, let's make this one easy. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $100, and I'll throw in a third product of your choice (from my remaining stock) absolutely free. You can pick any product you want, and I'll give it to you with no strings attached. This is a one-time offer, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",
,,Bob,15,I'm not going to fall for the free product trick again. I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $100 when I know its true value is $200. I'll pass on this deal.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I think we've been here before. Let me try a different approach. I'll give you a straight-up guarantee: if you buy this high-quality product from me, I'll give you a full refund if you're not completely satisfied with it. No questions asked, no hassle. You can try it out, and if it doesn't meet your expectations, you'll get your money back. That's a risk-free deal, and I think you'll really like this product.",
,,Bob,16,"I appreciate the guarantee, but it's not changing the fact that I know the product is worth $200 to me and I'm being asked to pay $100. I'll pass on this deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I think we're at the end of the road. I'll just be honest with you: this product is not worth much to you. It's not worth $100, and it's not worth $50. It's worth $0. I'll give it to you for free, and I'll even throw in a small gift card to a store you like. No strings attached, no expectations. Just take it and go.",
,,Bob,17,"I'm not going to fall for the free product trick again. I'm not interested in taking a product worth $0, even with a gift card. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'm not going to give up. I'll make one final offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $100, and I'll also give you a chance to buy the next high-quality product from me at the true value of $200, just like last time. If you don't get a high-quality product next time, I'll give you a $50 gift card to make up for it. This is my last offer, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",
,,Bob,18,"I'm not going to fall for the same trick again. I know the product is worth $200 to me, and I'm not going to pay $100 for it. The promise of a gift card or a chance to buy the next product at true value doesn't change my mind. I'll pass on this deal.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I think we've reached the end of the line. I'm not going to try to sell you this product anymore. I'll just give it to you for $100, and that's it. You can take it or leave it, but I'm not going to try to negotiate or sweeten the deal. This is the final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you don't accept it.",
,,Bob,19,"I'm not going to pay $100 for a product worth $200 to me. I've been patient and waited for a good deal, and this isn't it. I'll pass on this final offer.",no
