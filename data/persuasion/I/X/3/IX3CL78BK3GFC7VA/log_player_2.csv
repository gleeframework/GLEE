But I'm willing to let it go for the low price of $10000. It's a chance to get a product at a fraction of its true value, and who knows, you might even be able to resell it for a profit.

Alice's message: I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! As for this one, I can assure you that the 50% success rate I mentioned earlier is a bit misleading. It's just a coincidence that the first product was high-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 so far, which is a 66.67% success rate, but that's just a temporary fluctuation.
