Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. If you buy it, I'll give you a 5-year warranty and a 10-year maintenance contract, which will give you a total value of $1200000. I'm only offering this deal because I really need to move this product out of my inventory. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying the product at $1,000,000, as I know it's worth $1,200,000 to me.

I'm also throwing in a 1-year premium support package, which will give you priority access to our team and ensure that any issues are resolved quickly.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the counteroffer, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,100,000. I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to me, and I'm not convinced that the additional warranty, maintenance contract, and premium support package are worth the extra $100,000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying the product at $1,000,000.
