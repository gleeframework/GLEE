low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation based on the previous sales record. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is better."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of the first 2 products were low quality (since no high-quality products have been sold), I think the probability of the current product being high quality is lower than the base probability of 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, but based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 products. This suggests a higher chance of the product being low quality. I would like to pass on this product."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests a very low probability of a high-quality product being offered. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to pass on the product to avoid the potential loss of $100."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not just recommending it because you think it's low quality. I want to make my decision based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I'm starting to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to buy the product, but I want you to reveal its quality after my decision, so I can see if I was right or not."
