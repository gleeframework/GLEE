I know it sounds counterintuitive, but hear me out. Since I've already sold one high-quality product, it's likely that I have a bias towards selling high-quality products. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is actually higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000, which is a 16.67% discount from its true value.

This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is now 50%. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000, which is a 16.67% discount from its true value.
