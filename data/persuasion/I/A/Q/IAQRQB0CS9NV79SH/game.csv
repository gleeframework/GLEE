,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, since 3 out of 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and all of them passed, it suggests that the products recommended were likely low-quality. Therefore, I'm inclined to pass on this product and see if the next product will be recommended to me."
