,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's not high-quality, since I've seen that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product.
