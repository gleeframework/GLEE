This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Since Bob bought the high-quality product in the previous round, I can infer that he is willing to pay at least $1000000 for a high-quality product.

Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and Bob bought the high-quality product in the previous round, I'll assume that he is more likely to be willing to pay the price for a high-quality product.
