I've sold 2 low-quality products and 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products, which means the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 1/3. But let me put it in perspective: if I were selling a fair coin, you'd expect to see a 1/3 chance of getting heads (high-quality product) and a 2/3 chance of getting tails (low-quality product). And that's exactly what you're seeing. I'm willing to let you buy this one for $1,000,000. It's a fair chance to get a $3,000,000 product, and I'm not trying to deceive you. What do you say?""}"

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the new information, I'd like to do some quick math.
