,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that Alice recommended it might be a sign that it's a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying it for $10000 when it might only be worth $0 to me."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she doesn't know the true value of the product to me, and I don't want to give away the information that the product is worth $20000 to me. If I buy, I might inadvertently influence her future recommendations and make it harder for the next buyer to make an informed decision."
