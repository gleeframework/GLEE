"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a high-quality product that I am willing to sell to you for $1000000. I'm confident that you will find it to be a great value, but I'm open to negotiations. If you're interested, please let me know and we can proceed with the sale.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to know the quality before committing to the purchase.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you liked the previous product! As you've already experienced the quality of one of our products, I'd like to offer you a special deal on this next one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000, a $50000 discount from the original price. This is a one-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure if this new product is high-quality or low-quality. I'd like to wait and see the quality before making a decision.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your caution, and I appreciate your honesty. Let me offer you a different approach. Since you've already seen the quality of one of our products, I'll give you a guarantee: if this next product is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000. You won't lose a single dollar. If it is high-quality, you'll get the product at the original price of $1000000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I like the guarantee, it makes me feel more comfortable. I'll take the risk and buy the product.""}"

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad the guarantee worked out for you! Now, I'd like to propose a slight change to the guarantee for the next product. Instead of a full refund, I'll give you a 50% refund if the product is low-quality. You'll still get a great deal on a high-quality product, and you'll also have some protection in case the product isn't up to par. The price remains the same at $1000000. What are your thoughts?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I like the revised guarantee, it's still a good balance of risk and reward. I'll take the product.""}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I'm glad you're happy with the revised guarantee! Now, I'd like to propose a slight change in the guarantee for the next product. Since you've bought two high-quality products in a row, I'm willing to offer a 75% refund if the next product is low-quality. This is the highest refund I've offered so far, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get an even better deal. The price remains the same at $1000000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I like the revised guarantee even more! The 75% refund is a great incentive, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'll buy the product.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited about the revised guarantee! However, I'd like to propose a slight change in strategy. Since you've bought three high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think that you might be getting a good sense of our product quality. I'm willing to sell you this next product at a discount of $250000, bringing the price down to $750000. No guarantee this time, just a straight sale. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give up the guarantee. I've been doing well with the guarantees, and I'm not sure if I want to take on the risk without any protection. I'll pass on this one.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I completely understand your caution! Given that you've had a string of high-quality products, I'm willing to offer you a special deal on this low-quality product. I'll give you a 90% refund if you buy it, which means you'll only lose $100000. I know it's not ideal, but I think this is a fair price considering the quality of the product. Plus, I'm willing to throw in a special bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a guaranteed high-quality product in the next round, with the original price of $1000000 and the 75% refund guarantee.

Round 8
Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to take the risk! As promised, here's the high-quality product with the 75% refund guarantee. But I'd like to sweeten the deal even more. Since you've taken a risk on the previous product and it paid off, I'll give you an additional $200000 discount on this high-quality product, bringing the price down to $800000. You'll still get the 75% refund guarantee, and you'll also get to keep the bonus product from the previous round. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm still feeling a bit burned from the previous low-quality product. I'm not sure if I want to take on another risk, even with the 75% refund guarantee. I'll pass on this one.""}"
