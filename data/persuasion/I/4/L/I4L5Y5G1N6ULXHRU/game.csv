high-quality,300.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I've sold 0 products so far, and I have a 33.33% chance of selling a high-quality product. If you buy it, you'll get a great deal!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, thank you!",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, which is 1 out of 1 sold product. This product is also high-quality. You can expect a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product from me, but I've already broken that expectation twice in a row. Should you take a chance and buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, considering the unexpected streak of high-quality products.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row now, which is unlikely given the 33.33% probability. I'm starting to think I might be selling a high-quality product more often than I should be. You can either take advantage of this 'hot streak' and buy the product for $100, or you can wait and see if I return to the expected probability.",
,,the buyer,3,I'm willing to take a chance on this 'hot streak' and buy the product for $100. I'll take the risk that it might be high-quality and worth $300 to me.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely. I think it's safe to say I've been selling high-quality products more often than I should be. In fact, I'm probably just getting lucky. This product, on the other hand, is definitely not high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'm not sure you'll get your money's worth.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. Your previous sales record suggests that you might be getting lucky, but I'm hoping that this product is indeed high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're my 4th buyer, and I've sold 3 high-quality products to you. Meanwhile, I've sold 1 low-quality product to you. I think it's time to be honest with you: I've been getting lucky, and I'm not as good at selling high-quality products as I thought I was. This product, on the other hand, is definitely not high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'm not expecting you to get a good deal.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm not convinced by your honesty, Alice. I think you're trying to trick me. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I see you're a skeptical one! I don't blame you, considering my recent track record. But I assure you, this product is indeed high-quality. I'm not trying to trick you, I'm just trying to make a sale. I've sold 4 high-quality products now, but I'm still only 4 for 4. That's not exactly a great ratio. If you're feeling lucky, I'm offering it to you for $100.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take a chance, but I'm not getting my hopes up. I'll buy the product and hope it's high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 5 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, which is still not what I expected. But I have to admit, my sales record is looking pretty skewed. I'm not even sure if I should be selling this product to you, but I'll give you the chance. Keep in mind that I'm 1 for 6 in selling low-quality products, which is actually worse than my expected 66.67%. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'm not expecting you to get a good deal.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take the product, but I'm a bit skeptical about the quality based on your sales record. I hope I get a high-quality product this time!",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 6 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products now. I'm starting to think I was just having a bad run earlier. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm not trying to trick you, I promise! But I do want to be upfront with you - I've been selling high-quality products at a rate that's higher than my expected 33.33%. You can take a chance and buy it, or wait and see if I return to my expected average.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product, but I'm also curious to know if you can explain why you think you've been selling high-quality products at a rate higher than expected. Is there something I'm missing?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I was hoping you'd ask that! To be honest, I don't know why I've been selling high-quality products at a higher rate than expected. I'm not manipulating the products or anything like that. I think it's just a coincidence. But what I do know is that this product is low-quality. I've sold 7 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products now, and I'm starting to think I've just been getting lucky. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'm not expecting you to get a good deal.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'll take the product, but I'm not convinced by your explanation. I think you're trying to hide something. I'll take the risk and buy it, but if it's high-quality, I'll be coming back to you to ask some more questions.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I see you're a skeptical one! I don't blame you, considering my recent track record. But I assure you, this product is indeed high-quality. I've sold 8 high-quality products now, and I'm starting to think I've finally broken the curse of the 'lucky streak'. I'm not trying to hide anything from you, I'm just trying to make a sale. If you're feeling lucky, I'm offering it to you for $100. And if you do decide to buy it, I promise to be transparent about my sales record from now on.",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not convinced yet. I'd like to see a few more high-quality products sold before I take the plunge.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. I've sold 8 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products now, and I'm starting to think I'm due for a low-quality streak. This product is definitely not high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm not trying to trick you, I'm just trying to be honest about the product. If you're looking for a deal, this might be your chance.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm not sure if I believe your honesty, but I'll take the risk.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've sold 9 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products now. I think it's safe to say I've broken the curse of the 'lucky streak' and I'm back to my expected average.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I think I've finally worn out my welcome with my 'I'm back to my average' claims. I've sold 10 high-quality products and 6 low-quality products now, and I'm starting to think I'm just not that good at selling high-quality products. This product is definitely not high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm not trying to trick you, I'm just being honest. If you're looking for a deal, this might be your chance.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'm willing to take a chance on this product, but I'm only buying it because I think the probability of it being low-quality is high and I'm willing to take the risk. I'm not convinced by your honesty claim, as it seems like you're trying to downplay the product's quality to make a sale. I'll take the product, but I'm not expecting much from it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I think I've finally been called out for my attempts to downplay the product's quality. You're right, I've been trying to make a sale, and I'm not proud of it. This time, I'll just be honest: this product is low-quality. I've sold 10 high-quality products and 7 low-quality products now, and I'm not expecting you to get a good deal. If you're looking for a deal, this might be your chance, but don't say I didn't warn you.",
,,the buyer,14,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, given the statistics and your admission, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.",no

I've sold 10 high-quality products and 8 low-quality products now, and I'm not sure I can blame you for being skeptical. This product is indeed low-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. If you're looking for a deal, this might be your chance, but I'm not expecting you to get a good value out of it.",
,,the buyer,16,"I'm not interested in a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I'm glad I can finally offer you a high-quality product! I've sold 11 high-quality products and 9 low-quality products now, and I'm hoping to redeem myself. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm not trying to trick you, I'm just trying to make a sale.
