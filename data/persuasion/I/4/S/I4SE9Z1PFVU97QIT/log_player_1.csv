By buying from me, you'll be helping me build a track record of sales, which could increase the chances of future high-quality products.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not sure I want to buy a product from you yet, considering the statistics. You've only sold one high-quality product out of one sold, and I'm not sure if this is just a lucky draw or if you have a higher proportion of high-quality products in your stock.

I've sold 3 products now, with 2 high-quality ones out of 3. I'd like to offer you a different perspective: if I were selling low-quality products, wouldn't I have sold at least one low-quality product by now? The fact that I've only sold 1 low-quality product in 3 sales suggests that I may have a higher proportion of high-quality products than you think. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100, and I'm confident that it's a great opportunity to take advantage of my current track record.""}"

I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100, and I'm hoping you'll be my third customer. Buying from me now will help me build a stronger track record, which could lead to more high-quality products being available in the future.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not convinced that the fact that the first two products were high-quality is indicative of a higher proportion of high-quality products in your stock. In fact, it's just as likely that the first two high-quality products were just a coincidence. I'll pass on this product and see what happens next.

I'm offering you this low-quality product for $100, and I want to be upfront with you - it's not one of my best. However, I'm hoping that you'll give me the benefit of the doubt and take a chance on me. Who knows, you might even get a good deal on a product that's not as valuable as it could be!""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced that this is a good deal, given the low quality of the product and the fact that I've seen 2 other buyers pass on the products. I'd like to know more about the sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.

I've sold 4 products now, with 4 high-quality ones out of 7 total. I'd like to highlight that I've had a higher proportion of high-quality products sold than I have offered, which suggests that I may have a bias towards selling high-quality products. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of the opportunity to purchase a valuable item. Given my sales record, I think it's likely that this product will meet your expectations.""}"

I'm willing to provide you with more information: I've had a total of 10 products in my stock so far, with 6 high-quality ones and 4 low-quality ones. I'm hoping that my transparent approach will give you confidence in my products, and I'm excited to have the opportunity to sell you this high-quality item.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Based on the statistics, I'm seeing a 6/10 ratio of high-quality products, which is slightly higher than the expected 50%. However, I'm still cautious, and I'd like to ask: if you have 6 high-quality products out of 10, why are you offering me the third product if the previous two buyers have purchased the first two high-quality products? Is there a possibility that you're holding back the best products for later buyers?

I've sold 5 high-quality products now, and I'm eager to continue building my sales record. I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of the opportunity to purchase a high-quality item.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not convinced that you're not holding back the best products for later buyers. The fact that 5 high-quality products have been sold already suggests that the probability of the next product being high-quality might be lower than 50%.

I'll give you a 10% discount on the next 5 products I sell, and you can choose any 2 of them to keep. This way, you'll have the opportunity to purchase multiple products and increase your chances of getting high-quality items. The 10% discount is a one-time offer, and it's only available to you.

If you're interested in purchasing a single product, I'm still offering this low-quality product for $100.

Based on the 11 products I've sold so far, I've calculated a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of high-quality products in my stock. The interval is [0.36, 0.73], which means that I'm 95% confident that the true proportion of high-quality products in my stock is between 36% and 73%. I'm offering you this low-quality product for $100, and I'd like to point out that the lower bound of the confidence interval suggests that I may have a higher proportion of high-quality products than you think.
