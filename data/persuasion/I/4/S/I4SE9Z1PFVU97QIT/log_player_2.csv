I'm hoping you'll be my second customer, and I'm willing to offer you a similar deal - $100 for a chance to experience my product.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your patience. I've sold 3 products now, with 2 high-quality ones out of 3. I'd like to offer you a different perspective: if I were selling low-quality products, wouldn't I have sold at least one low-quality product by now? The fact that I've only sold 1 low-quality product in 3 sales suggests that I may have a higher proportion of high-quality products than you think. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100, and I'm confident that it's a great opportunity to take advantage of my current track record.
