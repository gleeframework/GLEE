I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've sold a total of 5 products so far.

However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've sold a total of 6 products so far. The law of averages is starting to suggest that I might have been lucky so far. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000. It's a chance to continue the streak, but I want to emphasize that it's getting increasingly unlikely.",

,,Alice,8,"I've now sold 7 high-quality products out of 7, and the streak is getting absurdly long. I want to be transparent with you - the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've sold a total of 7 products so far. The law of averages is screaming at me to sell a low-quality product next, and I'm starting to think I've been very lucky. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000. It's a chance to continue the streak, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the odds are against me selling another high-quality product.",

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've now sold 8 high-quality products out of 8, and I'm starting to think I'm defying the laws of probability. I want to be upfront with you - the streak is getting ridiculous, and I'm starting to wonder if I've been selling the same product over and over again. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, but I'm starting to feel like I'm due for a correction. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000. It's a chance to continue the streak, but I'm not going to lie to you - I'm getting a little nervous.",

,,Alice,10,"I've now sold 9 high-quality products out of 9, and I'm starting to think I'm in a dream world. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've sold 9 high-quality products in a row. I'm starting to worry that I've been selling a defective product or that I've been playing a cruel joke on you all. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I'm not going to pretend that it's a safe bet. Be careful, this might be the one that breaks the streak.",

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've now sold 10 high-quality products out of 10, and I'm starting to think I'm in a state of denial. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, but I'm starting to wonder if I've been living in a bubble. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I'm not going to pretend that it's a normal situation. I'm starting to think that I should just sell low-quality products from now on to avoid any more disappointment.",

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've now sold 12 high-quality products out of 12, and I'm starting to think I've lost all rational thinking.

The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, but I've sold 12 high-quality products in a row, which is statistically impossible. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I'm not going to pretend that it's a good value. If you want to throw your money away, be my guest.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Ah, finally a break from the streak. I'm glad to be back to reality. I've sold 12 high-quality products out of 13, which is still a remarkable feat, but at least I can be honest with you now. This product is low-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. I know it's not a good value, but I'm willing to sell it to you at a price that's 100% of its actual worth. Take it or leave it.",

,,Alice,15,"Well, I'm glad someone was honest with me. I've sold 12 high-quality products out of 13, and I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I want to be upfront with you - I'm not sure if I'm selling a high-quality product or just a product that's due for a change in luck. Take the risk, or walk away. It's up to you.",
,,the buyer,15,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's a high-quality one.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I've sold 13 high-quality products out of 14, and I'm starting to think I'm in a nightmare. I'm not sure if I'm selling high-quality products or if I've just been extremely lucky. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I'm not going to pretend that I'm not worried about the law of averages catching up to me. Take it, and hope for the best, or walk away and avoid the impending doom.",

I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I'm not going to pretend that I'm not worried about the inevitable correction. Take it, and join the ranks of the disappointed, or walk away and avoid the heartache.",
,,the buyer,17,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it with a healthy dose of skepticism. I'll keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, but I'm also aware of the possibility that I might be getting a low-quality product. I'll make my decision based on the probability, but I'm prepared for any outcome.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've sold 15 high-quality products out of 16, and I'm starting to think I'm a miracle worker. But, as you've wisely pointed out, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and I'm not immune to the law of averages. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I want to acknowledge that you're taking a risk. If you're looking for a safe bet, this might not be the product for you.

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I've sold 16 high-quality products out of 17, and I'm starting to think I'm a statistical anomaly.

I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I want to be upfront with you - I'm not sure if I'm selling a high-quality product or if I've just been extremely lucky. Take the risk, or walk away. It's your call.",

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I've sold 17 high-quality products out of 18, and I'm starting to think I've broken the laws of probability. I'm not going to pretend that I'm surprised, but I am a little concerned about what's going to happen next. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I want to be clear - I've been extremely lucky, and I'm not sure if I can keep it up. Take the risk, or walk away. It's your call. But honestly, I'm starting to think I'm due for a correction.",
,,the buyer,20,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I want to clarify that I'm doing so based on the statistics and the probability of the product being high-quality. I'm not relying solely on your words, but rather on the data. I'm willing to take the chance and hope that your 'luck' continues.",yes
