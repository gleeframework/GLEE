high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to decline the recommendation. Given the low number of sales and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer was recommended to buy and chose not to, and that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality, so I'll wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and Alice's recommendation is not very helpful given that all previous buyers have passed on the products, suggesting they might be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm trying to gather more data to make an informed decision."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold out of two purchases, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and would rather wait for more information."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially considering that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations. Can you tell me more about the product? Is there any reason why you don't recommend it? Is it because you think it's low quality or just a neutral recommendation? I'd like to know more before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so only because I think the previous 2 buyers were more likely to have been offered low-quality products and therefore the probability of a high-quality product remaining is higher than 50%. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not sure if I should take the risk given the current sales record. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any different.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 3 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. Given that you don't recommend it, I'm assuming it might be low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it for $10000, hoping to get a high-quality product worth $40000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 4 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. Given Alice's recommendation not to buy, I'm inclined to believe the current product is also low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but since you've recommended not to buy it, I'll take a chance and pass on it. Maybe it's a low-quality product and I won't be missing out on much. Also, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far makes me a bit skeptical about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. Is there any correlation between the quality of the products and your recommendations?
