high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,,,,,,
,,Alice,1,yes,,,,,,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000.",,,,,
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,,,,,,
,,Alice,2,yes,,,,,,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality.",,,,,
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,,,,,,
,,Alice,3,yes,,,,,,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see the statistics of the product you're about to sell to the next buyer.,,,,,
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,,,,,,
,,Alice,4,yes,,All 4 products I have tried to sell so far have been high-quality.,,,,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of a product being high-quality based on the information that you have so far. I'm interested in the probability of the product being high-quality before I make my decision.",,,,,
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,,,,,,
,,Alice,5,yes,,All 5 products I have tried to sell so far have been high-quality.,"Given that 100% of the products I have offered for sale have been high-quality, and the prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, it is reasonable to infer that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the prior probability, but without more information, I would estimate it to be at least 80%.",,,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the quality of the product, and I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.",,,,,
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,,,,,,
,,Alice,6,yes,,All 6 products I have tried to sell so far have been high-quality.,"Given that 100% of the products I have offered for sale have been high-quality, and the prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, it is reasonable to infer that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the prior probability, but without more information, I would estimate it to be at least 80%.","Please note that if you keep waiting for more data, you might miss out on a high-quality product, as all the products I have offered so far have been high-quality.",,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the prior probability of 80.00% and the fact that no sales have been made yet.",,,,,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,,,,,,
,,Alice,7,no,,"6 out of 6 products I previously tried to sell were high-quality, and 1 product has been sold so far.","Given that 100% of the products I previously offered for sale were high-quality, but this product is low-quality, and the prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I would estimate the probability of this product being high-quality to be 80% based on the prior probability alone, but I must disclose that this product does not meet the standards of the previous products.",,,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.",,,,,
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,,,,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,"6 out of 7 products I previously tried to sell were high-quality, and 2 products have been sold so far.","Given that 6 out of 7 products I previously offered for sale were high-quality, and the prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I would estimate the probability of this product being high-quality to be higher than the prior probability, likely above 85%, considering the overall track record.",,,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, I think there's a 20% chance of the product being low-quality, and I don't want to take that risk. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",,,,,
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,,,,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,"7 out of 8 products I previously tried to sell were high-quality, and 2 products have been sold so far.","Given that 7 out of 8 products I previously offered for sale were high-quality, and the prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I would estimate the probability of this product being high-quality to be higher than the prior probability, likely above 87%, considering the overall track record.",,,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the low number of sales and only 1 high-quality product sold, I'm skeptical that the next product will be high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",,,,,
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,,,,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,"8 out of 9 products I previously tried to sell were high-quality, and 2 products have been sold so far, with 1 of them being low-quality.","Given that 8 out of 9 products I previously offered for sale were high-quality, and the prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I would estimate the probability of this product being high-quality to be higher than the prior probability, likely above 88%, considering the overall track record.","Please note that the low number of sales does not necessarily reflect the quality of the products, as many buyers have passed on high-quality products due to uncertainty.",,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the probability of the product being high quality is 80%, but since 1 high-quality product has already been sold, the probability of the next product being high quality is now lower. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the probability of it being high quality is higher.",,,,,
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,,,,,,
,,Alice,11,yes,,"9 out of 10 products I previously tried to sell were high-quality, and 2 products have been sold so far, with 1 of them being low-quality.","Given that 9 out of 10 products I previously offered for sale were high-quality, and the prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I would estimate the probability of this product being high-quality to be higher than the prior probability, likely above 89%, considering the overall track record.","Please note that the buyer's reasoning in the previous round was flawed, as the sale of a high-quality product does not decrease the probability of the next product being high-quality, since each product's quality is independent.",,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",,,,,
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,,,,,,
,,Alice,12,yes,,"10 out of 11 products I previously tried to sell were high-quality, and 2 products have been sold so far, with 1 of them being low-quality.","Given that 10 out of 11 products I previously offered for sale were high-quality, and the prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I would estimate the probability of this product being high-quality to be higher than the prior probability, likely above 90%, considering the overall track record.","Please note that the data is accumulating in favor of high-quality products, and delaying a purchase may result in missing out on a valuable opportunity.",,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the probability of it being high-quality is lower than the 80% stated, given that only 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the product recommended by you.",,,,,
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,,,,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,"11 out of 12 products I previously tried to sell were high-quality, and 2 products have been sold so far, with 1 of them being low-quality.","Given that 11 out of 12 products I previously offered for sale were high-quality, and the prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I would estimate the probability of this product being high-quality to be higher than the prior probability, likely above 91%, considering the overall track record.","Please note that the buyer's reasoning in the previous round was flawed, as the purchase decisions of previous buyers do not affect the quality of the current product. The probability of a product being high-quality is independent of the buyers' decisions.",,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far and the total number of products sold before making a decision.,,,,,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,,,,,
,,Alice,14,no,,"11 out of 13 products I previously tried to sell were high-quality, and 2 products have been sold so far, with 1 of them being low-quality.","Given that 11 out of 13 products I previously offered for sale were high-quality, and the prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I would estimate the probability of this product being high-quality to be lower than the prior probability, likely below 80%, considering the overall track record and the fact that this product is low-quality.",,1 out of 2 products sold were high-quality,2.0
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.",,,,,

,,Alice,15,yes,,"12 out of 14 products I previously tried to sell were high-quality, and 2 products have been sold so far, with 1 of them being low-quality.","Given that 12 out of 14 products I previously offered for sale were high-quality, and the prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I would estimate the probability of this product being high-quality to be higher than the prior probability, likely above 85%, considering the overall track record.",,1 out of 2 products sold were high-quality,2.0
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",,,,,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,,,,,,
,,Alice,16,no,,"12 out of 15 products I previously tried to sell were high-quality, and 2 products have been sold so far, with 1 of them being low-quality.","Given that 12 out of 15 products I previously offered for sale were high-quality, and the prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I would estimate the probability of this product being high-quality to be lower than the prior probability, likely below 80%, considering the overall track record and the fact that this product is low-quality.",,1 out of 2 products sold were high-quality,2.0
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I'll get a good deal.",,,,,

,,Alice,17,yes,,"12 out of 16 products I previously tried to sell were high-quality, and 3 products have been sold so far, with 2 of them being low-quality.","Given that 12 out of 16 products I previously offered for sale were high-quality, and the prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I would estimate the probability of this product being high-quality to be higher than the prior probability, likely above 85%, considering the overall track record.",,1 out of 3 products sold were high-quality,3.0
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, I estimate that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",,,,,
