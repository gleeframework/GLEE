,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because of Alice's lack of recommendation. I'm expecting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the products offered so far were low quality. I'd like to wait for a high-quality product to be offered."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is very low. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it seems unlikely that this product is high-quality. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems like the probability of the product being high quality is quite low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is higher than 33.33%. I'll pass on this product and wait for the next one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Given the previous 5 buyers have all passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm starting to suspect that your recommendations might be based on the product's quality. If you're recommending a product, it's likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from a new buyer who has not yet seen the previous sales record."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
