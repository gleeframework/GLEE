Alice's message: I understand your concerns. I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, which means I have a 50% success rate. However, I'd like to point out that the first product I sold was high-quality, and the odds are in your favor that the next one might be as well. Think of it as a 50/50 chance to get a $40000 product for $10000. It's a calculated risk, but one that could yield a significant return. What do you say?
