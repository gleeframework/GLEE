**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability:** Even with the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, the 2/6 sales history indicates a higher-than-expected proportion of high-quality products sold.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has a clear incentive to recommend products that will lead to sales, which suggests that she is likely recommending high-quality products.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $125 outweighs the risk of losing $100.

**Overall:** The available information suggests a reasonable chance of getting a high-quality product, and it makes sense to take the risk given the potential payoff."
