,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that it's high quality. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality based on the data so far? I'm aware that it's 80.00% chance of being high quality and 20.00% chance of being low quality, but I'd like to know the probability after considering the fact that I'm the first buyer."

,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the previous buyer's purchase was a high-quality product, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation, and I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."

,,the buyer,8,no,I would like to pass on this product and see the recommendation for the next buyer. I want to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, and I'd like to see the previous buyer's decision and the product's quality before making my decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'd also like to know what led you to recommend it to me. Was it the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, or was there another factor?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to the next buyer, based on the current statistics."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the product and see if you have any information about the previous buyers' experiences with the product's quality.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/2 or 100%. This seems too good to be true. I'm concerned that the sample size is too small and the probability of getting a high-quality product might be higher than 80%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the previous sales record to inform my decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially since I have access to the statistics. With only 2 high-quality products sold out of 4 (2 buyers), it seems like there might be a bias towards recommending products that are more likely to be high-quality. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is like."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high, but I'd like to see more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 total sales, which means that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 100%. However, this is likely due to the small sample size and the fact that I'm the third buyer. I'm concerned that the next product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
