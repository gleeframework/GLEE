However, I want to make it clear that this one is slightly different from the first one. It's a more specialized item, and its value lies in its unique features and capabilities. I'm confident you'll appreciate its nuances and be willing to pay a premium for it. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

Round 3
Alice's message: I'm glad you're open to unique items! However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is not as exceptional as the previous two.

I'm willing to let it go for the same price as the previous two, but I want to make sure you're aware of its limitations. It's a good value, but it's not a game-changer. What are your thoughts?
