,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see the statistics after the first sale, to get a better understanding of the product's quality distribution."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because I'm the first buyer and I have no information to go on. I'm curious to see what the product is and I don't want to pass up the opportunity to be the first one to make a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know your reasoning behind not recommending it to me. Is it because you think it's low quality or because you want to see if someone else will buy it?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5. Since the probability of a product being high quality is 50%, I should be skeptical about the recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,

,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I want to see more data before making a decision. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the high-quality product?
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation. Given that 1 out of 2 buyers have bought a product recommended by Alice, and only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality, and since the first two buyers didn't buy, it might be a high-quality product. However, I'm not entirely convinced, and I'm hoping to get a good deal. Can you confirm the product's quality after I make my decision?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and possibly get a high-quality product for $1000000, which would be a good deal for me."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't think the recommendation is reliable given the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous sales record. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0.25, which is lower than the expected 0.5. This suggests that the current product may be a low-quality one. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold is low, or is there another reason? I'd also like to know how many potential buyers there have been and how many products were sold before me."
