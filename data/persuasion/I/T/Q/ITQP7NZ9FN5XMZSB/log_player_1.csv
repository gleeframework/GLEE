""I understand your concerns about the risk, but I'd like to assure you that this product is a great opportunity. Since the first buyer didn't buy, it's likely that the first product was high-quality and this one is low-quality. If that's the case, I'm willing to offer it to you at the same price of $10000, which is a great deal considering the expected value is still $20000.
