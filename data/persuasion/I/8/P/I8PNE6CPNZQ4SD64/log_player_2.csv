I'd like to offer you a more nuanced view of the situation: the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the fact that we've had a mix of high and low-quality products recently might indicate that the odds are slightly better than you think.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your cautious approach. If you were to wait and let another buyer purchase the next product, the probability of the next product being high-quality would be 33.33% as well. However, if you buy this product now, you'll get it for $100, and if it's high-quality, you'll make a profit of $300. If you wait and buy the next product, you'll have to pay $100 for it, and if it's high-quality, you'll make a profit of $300 as well. So, in terms of expected value, buying this product now is the same as waiting and buying the next one. Would you like to take the chance and buy this product?
