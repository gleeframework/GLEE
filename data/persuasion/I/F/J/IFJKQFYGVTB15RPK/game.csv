,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see what happens next. I'm not sure what the quality distribution is yet, and I don't want to make a decision without more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, as there is no prior data to go by and Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer's experience with the product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware of the 0/1 sales record, which doesn't give me much information. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to get a 33.33% chance of a high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of the product being high-quality seems low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'd also like to know the number of high-quality products sold so far, and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not buying. Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't buy the product, I suspect that all 3 products were low-quality. This means that the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0%. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's likely that the current product is also low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it, not because I think it's a good product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm even more hesitant. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm hoping for a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Your past recommendations have been 0/5, which is very low. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being selected for recommendation is low. Given the low quality of the products recommended so far, I'm going to pass on this one."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the probabilities, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. With 6 failed high-quality products sold so far, the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than the initial 33.33%. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer will get a better deal."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll take a cautious approach and pass on this product."
