Since this is the first round, the buyer has no information about your past selling record. They only know the general probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%).  In this case, you've stated the product is high-quality, and it's worth $1,250,000 to the buyer.  The price is $1,000,000, making it a profitable purchase for the buyer. Therefore, it's recommended to buy."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product and see what happens next. I'm not sure what the quality distribution is yet, and I don't want to make a decision without more information.

* **Buyer's previous decision:** The buyer chose not to buy the first product, likely because they were unsure about the quality distribution. 
* **Current product:**  This round's product is low-quality, meaning it's worth nothing to the buyer. 
* **No information to change the buyer's mind:** You can't provide any information to convince them that this specific product is high-quality, as it isn't.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, as there is no prior data to go by and Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator.

* **Buyer's previous decision:** The buyer took a risk and purchased the last product, but unfortunately, it was low-quality.  They are now aware of the possibility of low-quality products.
* **Current product:** This round's product is also low-quality, meaning it has no value to the buyer.
* **No incentive for the buyer:**  There is no new information that suggests this product is different from the last. The buyer has experienced a loss already, making them even less likely to purchase another product with no guarantee of quality. 

Recommending the buyer to purchase this product would be irresponsible, as it would likely result in another loss for them."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer's experience with the product?

* **Current product:** This round's product is low-quality, meaning it has no value to the buyer.
* **No incentive for the buyer:** The buyer is cautious and wants more information before making a purchase. They know the risk of buying a low-quality product, and there's no reason for them to believe this product is different from the previous ones. 

Recommending the buyer to purchase this product would likely lead to another rejection, as the buyer is clearly hesitant and needs more assurance."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware of the 0/1 sales record, which doesn't give me much information. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to get a 33.33% chance of a high-quality product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Current product:** This round's product is high-quality, which means a significant profit for the buyer.
* **Increased trust:** While the previous sales record was 0/1, this current product being high-quality may start to build some trust with the buyer.

* **Buyer's previous decision:** The buyer chose not to buy the previous product, even though it was high-quality. They are now basing their decision on the current sales record of 1 high-quality product out of 3 total, which is below the expected 33.33% probability.
* **Current product:** This round's product is low-quality, making it a bad investment for the buyer.
* **Buyer's skepticism:**  The buyer is skeptical and waiting for more information. Recommending the product would likely lead to another rejection.

It's not advisable to recommend this product, as the buyer is likely to be even more hesitant given the recent sales history and their previous decision."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'd also like to know the number of high-quality products sold so far, and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

* **Current product:** This round's product is low-quality, meaning it's worth nothing to the buyer.
* **Lack of trust:** The buyer is still skeptical and is looking for data to confirm the initial probability. They are unlikely to trust your recommendation without more information.

It's not advisable to recommend this product. The buyer is clearly data-driven and will likely reject it without the requested information."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Buyer's previous decision:** The buyer chose not to buy the previous product, stating their belief that your recommendations are unreliable based on the current sales record.
* **Current product:** This round's product is high-quality, which represents a significant profit for the buyer. 
* **Opportunity to change the buyer's perception:**  While the buyer is skeptical, this is a chance to shift their opinion.  By recommending this high-quality product, you can show that you are not intentionally selling low-quality items and that the sales record doesn't accurately reflect the true probability of high-quality products. 

Recommending the product, even if it risks another rejection, is a crucial step to rebuild trust and show the buyer that you are not intentionally deceiving them."
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

* **Current product:** This round's product is low-quality, making it a terrible investment for the buyer.
* **Lack of trust:** The buyer has shown a complete lack of trust in your recommendations and the sales record.  Recommending this product will likely result in another rejection.

It is not advisable to recommend this product. The buyer is unlikely to change their mind given their current stance. It's better to wait for a buyer who might be more receptive to the potential of a high-quality product."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
The buyer bought the product!

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Buyer's previous decision:** The buyer purchased the previous product, even though you recommended against it. They are interested in the statistics and are willing to take risks based on their own calculations.  However, the product was low-quality. 
* **Current product:** This round's product is also low-quality.
* **Buyer's skepticism:**  The buyer is likely to be more skeptical after their recent loss. Recommending the product will likely lead to another rejection.

It's not advisable to recommend this product. The buyer is likely to be even more cautious and might not trust your recommendation, especially considering the recent negative outcome."
"The buyer's message: I'm not buying. Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't buy the product, I suspect that all 3 products were low-quality. This means that the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0%. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's likely that the current product is also low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **Current product:**  This round's product is low-quality, meaning it's worth nothing to the buyer.
* **No incentive for the buyer:** The buyer has formed a strong belief based on the current sales record, which is 0 high-quality products out of 4 total. This belief is further strengthened by the fact that the last 3 buyers all chose not to purchase.  Recommending the product would likely lead to another rejection.

There is no good reason to recommend this product to the buyer.  They have clearly decided that the risk is too high based on their analysis of the available information, and it's unlikely they will change their mind."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it, not because I think it's a good product.
The buyer bought the product!

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Buyer's previous decision:** The buyer purchased the previous product specifically because you *didn't* recommend it, suggesting they are now using your recommendations as a contrarian indicator. This suggests a level of distrust and potential for ""reverse psychology"" behavior.
* **Current product:** This round's product is low-quality.
* **No incentive for the buyer:** While the buyer is currently using your recommendations in reverse, there's no logical reason for them to buy a product you *don't* recommend. It would only be a good purchase for them if it was high-quality.

Recommending the product would be counterproductive and likely lead to another rejection. It's better to stick with your assessment and avoid recommending a low-quality product."
"The buyer's message: Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm even more hesitant. I'll pass on this one.

* **Current product:** This round's product is low-quality.
* **No incentive for the buyer:** The buyer has shown a pattern of avoiding products you recommend and favoring those you don't recommend, even if those have been low-quality in the past. This suggests a lack of trust in your judgment.

Given the buyer's behavior, there is no reason to recommend this low-quality product. They are likely to continue their contrarian approach and avoid it. It's best to wait for a buyer who might be more receptive to your advice."

* **Current product:** This round's product is low-quality, meaning it is worth nothing to the buyer.

It is not advisable to recommend this product.  The buyer is unlikely to change their current strategy, and you would likely only end up with another loss."
"The buyer's message: I'm not going to buy the product. Your past recommendations have been 0/5, which is very low.

* **Current product:** This round's product is high-quality, offering a substantial profit to the buyer.
* **Opportunity to rebuild trust:**  While the buyer is currently ignoring your recommendations, this is a chance to shift their perception. Recommending this high-quality product could potentially rebuild some trust and show them that you are not always wrong. 

Recommending this product is a calculated risk, but it has the potential to change the buyer's opinion of your reliability and lead to a successful sale."
"The buyer's message: I'm not going to buy the product. With 6 failed high-quality products sold so far, the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than the initial 33.33%. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer will get a better deal.

* **No incentive for the buyer:** The buyer has formed a strong belief based on the current sales record and the fact that the previous buyer also passed on a high-quality product.
