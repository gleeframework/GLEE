high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't have any information about its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing this to get the first data point for the statistics, and I'm not expecting the product to be high-quality based on the lack of prior sales data. I'm buying to get the first data point, and I'll use it to inform my future decisions."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one sale and no high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products is likely to be low. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's recommendation is based on the product's quality, and there has been 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 product sold, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to gather data to make a more informed decision for the next buyer."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the current sales record and Alice's recommendation. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate a higher chance of the current product being low-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since 2 out of 2 previous products were low-quality.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous products were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than the average probability. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than the overall probability, making it less likely to be worth $125 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer has a better chance of getting a high-quality product.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet makes me think that Alice is trying to get rid of low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, which is a very low proportion of high-quality products. I'm not confident that this product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales so far and the lack of high-quality products sold. I'm hoping to be the first one to get a high-quality product!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that she knows my valuation and is trying to manipulate my decision based on the sales record. I'm hoping that the low-quality product ratio is higher than 66.67% because she's been recommending against the products, so I'm hoping the product is low quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 4 previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products and I'm not convinced that this one will be any different."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because you think it's low quality or is there another reason? I'd like to make an informed decision based on your previous sales record.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average, making it more likely that I'll get a high-quality product if I wait."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, as I'm surprised you wouldn't recommend a product given the lack of high-quality sales so far. Is it because you think the product is low quality or is there another reason?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, I'll pass on this one. If you recommended it, I'd consider buying it, but since you didn't, I'll let it go. Also, the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, which makes me more cautious."
