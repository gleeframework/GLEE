,,Alice,1,no,,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it!",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,no,,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, given that no high-quality products have been sold so far.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,no,,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous two buyers passed on the products, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,no,,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are accurate, and she only recommends products that are likely to be low quality. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, I'm inclined to trust her advice and pass on this one.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,no,,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.,
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,yes,,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high quality, I'm starting to suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,I want to assure you that my recommendation is genuine. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far is just a coincidence. The probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%. I'm confident that this product is of high quality.
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the current statistics. With 3 failed sales, it's likely that the products being sold are low-quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,no,,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,no,,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm going to pass on it. I'll wait for the next one.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,no,,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product so I can see the true value of the data and make a more informed decision for the next buyer.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,no,,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total products sold so far, as well as the proportion of products for which you recommended buying. This will help me make a more informed decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,no,,"Out of 12 previous sales, 0 high-quality products were sold. I recommended buying for 4 products and not buying for 8 products."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious, Alice, what's behind your recommendation? Are you trying to protect me from a low-quality product or is there something else I should know?",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,yes,,"I'm glad you asked! I've been trying to be as transparent as possible. When I recommend not buying, it's because I genuinely believe the product is low-quality. And when I recommend buying, it's because I believe the product is high-quality. This product I'm offering now is indeed high-quality, and I think it's worth the investment."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the pattern holds.",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"I want to address the pattern you're referring to. It's true that none of the previously recommended products were purchased, but that's because the buyers chose not to buy them, not because they were low-quality. In fact, some of those products were indeed high-quality. I assure you that this product is also high-quality, and I'm confident that it's worth the investment."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests that it's more likely to be low quality, given that all previous high-quality products were not purchased.",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,yes,,"I understand your concern, but I want to assure you that my recommendation is based on the actual quality of the product, not on any pattern or strategy. I've been trying to be transparent and honest throughout this process. This product is genuinely high-quality, and I believe it's worth the investment. I'm willing to stake my reputation on it."
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. With 4 purchases and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products she's recommending. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any better.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,no,,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems like Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to previous buyers. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if Alice's recommendation changes in the future.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm hesitant to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product, or is there another reason?",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,yes,,"I'm glad you asked! I've been trying to be transparent throughout this process. When I don't recommend a product, it's because I genuinely believe it's low-quality. And when I do recommend a product, it's because I believe it's high-quality. This product I'm offering now is indeed high-quality, and I think it's worth the investment. Unfortunately, this is the last round, and I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm confident that this product is one of the best ones I've offered so far."
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be of low quality. I'll pass on this opportunity.",
