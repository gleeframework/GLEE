,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 product sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm not taking Alice's recommendation into account."

,,Alice,6,no,

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Are you recommending not to buy because you think it's low-quality, or are you recommending not to buy because you think it's high-quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold before I make a decision."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if it's high quality or low quality, and given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't buy the product, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. It seems that 0 out of 4 buyers were recommended to buy and all of them passed. I'm not sure if I should take the risk.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendations. Can you explain your reasoning for not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. This is a contrarian strategy based on the fact that Alice's recommendation is based on her information, but I have access to the overall statistics."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers bought a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers have bought a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on your previous recommendations, I think you have a low opinion of the products. Since the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/7, I will pass on the product."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying because of the low number of high-quality products sold so far. It seems like the probability of the product being high quality is higher than the overall probability of 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 8 out of 8 buyers have not purchased a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%. I'll pass on this one."
