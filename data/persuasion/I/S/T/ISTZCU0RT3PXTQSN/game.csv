low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I'm the first buyer, and I have no information about its quality yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm the second buyer, and I'm not sure if I should rely on your recommendation yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product since the previous two buyers didn't buy it despite your recommendations."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm worried that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not going to buy it based on your previous recommendations. If you don't recommend it, I'm even less likely to buy it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the 50/50 chance of it being low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the statistics or something else?
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have purchased and none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate so far, but I'm hoping for a high-quality product and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure I want to buy a product that Alice doesn't recommend, and given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not going to buy it based on your recommendation. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the low success rate of high-quality products so far."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I'm suspicious that this product might also be low-quality. I'd rather wait for a better offer or more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that Alice knows my valuation and is trying to manipulate me, so I'm taking the opposite action. My reasoning is that if the product is high quality, I'll get a good deal, and if it's low quality, I'll still get a good deal because I'm not paying for it. However, I'm aware that this is a high-risk strategy and I might end up losing money if the product is high quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is lower than the overall average. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that all previous buyers who received your recommendations chose to buy, and yet no high-quality products have been sold. This suggests that the previous buyers may have been misled by your recommendations. I'd like to see more information about the products before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on your past recommendations, it seems like you've been recommending low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I think it's likely that the next product will be low quality, and I don't want to risk buying a product that's worth $0 to me."
