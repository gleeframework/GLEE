It's not as polished as the previous two, and I'm not sure it's worth the full $100. I'm offering it to you at a discount, but I'm only willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a risk, but I think it's worth it if you're feeling adventurous.",

This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping you'll give me another chance to make a sale. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to lower the price and increase the refund guarantee, I'm still hesitant.  I'm not comfortable with the risk involved, even with the added protection.  Perhaps we can discuss this again in the future when I have more confidence in the quality of your products.",no
