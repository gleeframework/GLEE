Alice's message: I completely understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your cautious approach. I'm happy to provide more information to help you make a more informed decision. As it turns out, the high-quality product from Round 1 was actually purchased by a buyer who was willing to take a risk and didn't ask for any additional information. The buyer from Round 2, who purchased the low-quality product, was willing to take a calculated risk and negotiated the price. With this new information, I can see that our products are indeed unpredictable, and it's hard to make a prediction based on small sample sizes. However, I still believe that this product has the potential to be high-quality, and I'm willing to offer the same bonus service and perks as before.
