,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the statistics, which show that 0 out of 1 product was high-quality.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be based on any information about the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 3rd buyer. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, but I'm willing to take the risk and purchase it. I'd like to know the product's quality after my decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Given the low success rate, I'm not convinced that this product is worth the $1000000 price tag."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have bought the products despite the 0 high-quality products sold, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards encouraging buyers to purchase. I'm going to pass on this product."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
