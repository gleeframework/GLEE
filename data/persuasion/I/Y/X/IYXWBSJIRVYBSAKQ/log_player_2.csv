**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We only know one product has been sold and it was high quality. This is a very small sample size to draw strong conclusions from.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product, despite the limited information, suggests she believes it is high quality.  
* **Risk/Reward:** Even if the product is low quality (50% chance), it only costs $100. If it's high quality (50% chance), it's worth $120 to me. The potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation Alice! I'm feeling optimistic about this one.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on. We know 2 buyers have purchased products, and 1 was high-quality. This is a small sample size, so it's hard to draw strong conclusions.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  While not foolproof, Alice's recommendation does add some weight to the possibility of the product being high-quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential payoff of $120 if it's high quality is significant. Even though there's a 50% chance of it being low quality and worthless, the potential gain outweighs the potential loss in this case.

**This decision is a gamble, but based on the limited information available, it makes sense to take the risk.**"

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'm willing to take a chance on this product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal, as she likely wouldn't recommend a product she believes is low quality.
* **Favorable statistics:** The previous sales record shows a 50% success rate (3 high-quality out of 6 sold), which is exactly what we'd expect given the odds.  This suggests the recommendations are generally accurate.
* **Risk/Reward:**  Even if the product is low quality, the worst-case scenario is losing $100. However, the potential gain of a high-quality product ($120 value - $100 price = $20 profit) outweighs the risk. 

**While there's no guarantee, the available information makes buying the product the best choice in this situation.**"
