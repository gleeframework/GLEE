,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your skepticism, and I want to be transparent with you. To be honest, this product isn't one of my strongest offerings. It's not a bad product, but it's not a game-changer either. I'm willing to let it go for $800000, which is significantly lower than the usual price. I'm doing this because I want to clear out some inventory and make room for newer, better products. It's a risk, but I think it's worth considering, especially at this price point.",

I'll let it go for $600000, and I'll throw in some additional support to help you get the most out of it. I'll provide you with a dedicated team to help you implement the product and ensure you're getting the results you want. It's not a great product, but it's a decent value at this price point, and I think the support will make a big difference.",

I'm not going to sugarcoat it, but I think it's a bit of a dud. However, I'm willing to let it go for $400000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I'm not trying to make a sale on this one; I just want to clear out inventory. If you're looking to take a risk on a product that might not pan out, this could be a good opportunity.",
