Alice's message: You have the opportunity to buy a product, but I'll be honest with you, I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and I'm not sure if this one is good or bad. The odds are 50/50. I'm selling it to you for $10000. If you buy it and it's high-quality, you'll be getting a great deal. If it's low-quality, well... you might want to think twice.

That's a 66.7% chance of getting a high-quality product. Considering the price is still $10000, I think it's a bit of a gamble. But hey, if you're feeling lucky, go for it!

Alice's message: You're considering buying from me, but I want to give you a reality check. I've sold 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, which means the ratio of high-quality to low-quality is 3:1. That's a pretty good chance of getting a great product. Plus, I've been transparent about the numbers, so you know exactly what you're getting into. $10000 is still a lot of money, but I think it's worth it for a 3:1 shot at a high-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the detailed information, Alice.

Alice's message: You're considering buying from me, but I want to be upfront with you - the numbers are starting to look a bit suspicious. I've sold 4 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products, which means the ratio of high-quality to low-quality is 2:1. That's not as convincing as it was before. And to be honest, I'm starting to feel a bit like I'm selling more low-quality products than I should be. Maybe it's just a coincidence, but maybe it's not. $10000 is a lot of money, and I'm not sure it's worth the risk this time around.

Alice's message: I know I just told the last buyer that the numbers were suspicious, but I want to reassure you that I'm not trying to hide anything. The numbers are still 4 high-quality and 3 low-quality products, which means the ratio is still 4:3. I'm not trying to deceive you, but I do want to be upfront about the fact that I've sold 3 low-quality products in a row. That's not great.

Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like I'm on a roll with these low-quality products. 5 low-quality products in a row is a bit concerning, to be honest.

Alice's message: I appreciate your feedback and I'm actually considering implementing some changes to my quality control process.
