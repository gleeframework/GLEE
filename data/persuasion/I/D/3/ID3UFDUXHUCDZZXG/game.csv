,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? And what's the probability that the current product is high-quality based on the data?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure I want to take the risk based on the previous sales record. If all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product has decreased, making the expected value of buying the product lower than the price. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that all previous products were low quality, which suggests that the probability of this product being high quality might be higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
