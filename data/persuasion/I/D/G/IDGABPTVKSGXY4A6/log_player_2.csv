While it's still a great product, it's not as high-end as the previous two. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as before, but I want to make sure you're aware of the slight difference in quality.

Round 6
Alice's message: I'm glad you're feeling confident, but I want to make sure you're aware that this next product is actually a bit of a departure from the previous ones.
