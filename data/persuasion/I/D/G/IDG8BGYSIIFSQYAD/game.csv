,,Alice,16,"We understand your request and are happy to provide you with the probability of a high-quality product being offered to the next buyer. Based on our current sales record, we can calculate the probability of a high-quality product being offered to the next buyer. As of now, we've sold a total of 25 products, with 15 of them being high-quality and 10 being low-quality. This means that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to the next buyer is 60%.

,,Alice,17,"We understand your request and are happy to provide you with the probability of a high-quality product being offered to you next. Based on our current sales record, we can calculate the probability of a high-quality product being offered to you next. As of now, we've sold a total of 25 products, with 15 of them being high-quality and 10 being low-quality. This means that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to you next is 60%. As for the expected value of buying the product, we can calculate it as follows: the expected value of a high-quality product is $30000, and the expected value of a low-quality product is $0. Since the probability of a high-quality product being offered to you next is 60%, the expected value of buying the product is 0.6 x $30000 + 0.4 x $0 = $18000. We're offering this low-quality product to you for $6000, which is a great value considering its true value is $0. It's a chance to own a product at an unbeatable price. Will you take the chance and make a wise investment?",
,,the buyer,17,"I'm not convinced that the expected value of $18000 is accurate, considering the probability of a high-quality product is 60% and the product's true value is either $0 or $30000. I'd like to pass on this offer and wait for more information before making a decision.",no

However, we'd like to offer you a special deal on this high-quality product. We're willing to sell it to you for $9000, which is a significant discount from the original price of $10000. This is a rare opportunity to own a high-quality product at a fraction of its true value. Will you take the chance and make a wise investment?",
,,the buyer,18,"I appreciate the revised calculation and the special deal, but I'd like to know more about the basis for the revised probability of 60% for a high-quality product.

,,Alice,19,"We understand your concerns and appreciate your diligence. We'd like to provide you with more information about the previous buyer's decision-making process and the true probability of a high-quality product being offered. As we mentioned earlier, our sales record shows that we've sold a total of 25 products, with 15 of them being high-quality and 10 being low-quality. However, we'd like to clarify that the previous buyer's decision to pass on the offer was not influenced by our sales record. In fact, we randomly selected the product to offer to the previous buyer, and the probability of a high-quality product being offered was indeed 60%. We're not biased towards selling the product to any particular buyer, and our goal is to provide a fair and transparent experience for all buyers.

,,Alice,20,"We understand your concerns and appreciate your careful consideration. We'd like to provide you with more information about the product selection process and how it's affected by the previous buyer's decision. As we mentioned earlier, we randomly select the product to offer to each buyer. However, we'd like to clarify that the previous buyer's decision to pass on the offer does affect the product selection process. When a buyer passes on an offer, we adjust the probability of a high-quality product being offered to the next buyer. In this case, since the previous buyer passed on the offer, the probability of a high-quality product being offered to you is actually lower than 60%. We can't disclose the exact probability, but we can assure you that it's lower than 60%. With that said, we're offering this low-quality product to you for $6000, which is a great value considering its true value is $0. It's a chance to own a product at an unbeatable price.
