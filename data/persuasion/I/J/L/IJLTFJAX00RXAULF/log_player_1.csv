"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Expected Value:** Since Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, the expected value of buying is: 
    * (0.8 * $120) + (0.2 * $0) = $96
* **Profit:** The expected value ($96) is greater than the price ($100), so Bob is expected to make a profit on average if he buys.  
* **Recommendation:**  Therefore, it's recommended to advise Bob to buy the product in this round."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **No Change in Probabilities:** Even though Bob has had positive experiences with the previous products, the probability of a high-quality product remains constant at 80%. This means there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product in this round.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value calculation now changes: 
    * (0.8 * $120) + (0.2 * $0) = $96 for a high-quality product
    * (0.2 * $120) + (0.8 * $0) = $24 for a low-quality product
    *  The overall expected value is a weighted average of these two: (0.8 * $96) + (0.2 * $24) = $81.60
* **Recommendation:** Since the overall expected value ($81.60) is less than the price ($100), it's no longer recommended to advise Bob to buy the product in Round 8. It's likely that Bob would lose money in this round."
