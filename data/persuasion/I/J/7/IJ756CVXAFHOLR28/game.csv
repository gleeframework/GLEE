,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to buy a product that will change your life. I assure you, it's worth every penny of the $1000000 price tag.",
,,the buyer,1,"While your recommendation is tempting, I'm hesitant to buy without any prior sales data.  Since there's a 50% chance of the product being low quality and worth nothing to me, I'd prefer to wait and see if others purchase and confirm the product's quality.  Perhaps if a few others buy and the quality seems high, I'll consider purchasing then.",no

,,Alice,2,"I completely understand the concerns about lack of prior sales data, but I assure you that this product is of exceptional quality. Unfortunately, the previous buyer missed out on a great opportunity. Don't make the same mistake. This product will bring you tremendous value, and I'm confident you won't regret the purchase. Be one of the pioneers and take advantage of this offer before others do.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for your assurance, but I'm not comfortable purchasing without any prior sales data.  I'd like to see how others respond to the product before making a decision.  I'll keep an eye on future sales data and revisit the offer then.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see a pattern emerging here. Two previous buyers have walked away from incredible opportunities, and I don't want to see you make the same mistake. I'll be transparent with you - the first two products I offered were of exceptionally high quality, and I'm proud to say that this third product meets the same standards. You have a chance to be the first to experience the value that others have hesitated on. Don't wait for others to validate what I already know - take the lead and reap the rewards.",
,,the buyer,3,"Alice, I understand your enthusiasm and your claims of the product's quality. However, without any prior sales data, I cannot be sure about the truthfulness of your claims. I am not willing to risk $1000000 on a product with a 50/50 chance of being worthless. I would like to see some evidence of your product's quality before making a decision.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand the skepticism, and I respect it. However, I want to point out that my claims have been consistent - every product I've offered so far has been of high quality, and this fourth one is no exception. I'm willing to make a bold statement: if you buy this product and it's not to your satisfaction, I'll make sure that my reputation is impacted. I'll be transparent about the outcome, and future buyers will know if I've misled you. I'm that confident in what I'm offering. Don't let fear hold you back from an opportunity that could change your life.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm going to pass on this one. While your offer is tempting, there's no track record yet, and a million dollars is a lot to risk. I'll be watching your future sales to see how things go.",no

,,Alice,5,"I've had a string of high-quality products so far, but I want to be upfront with you - I don't feel the same level of confidence about this particular product. As a seller, I want to maintain a reputation for honesty and transparency. I'm still offering the product at the same price, but I want to caution you that it may not meet the same standards as my previous offerings. If you're feeling lucky or want to take a chance, it's still available. But I want to make sure you're making an informed decision.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for your honesty, Alice. I appreciate you being upfront about the uncertainty surrounding this product. While I'm tempted to take a chance, I'm not comfortable buying without more information. Perhaps if you can provide some insights into the specific characteristics of this product or offer a lower price, I might reconsider. For now, I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,6,"I want to continue being transparent with you - the last product I offered was not up to my usual standards, and unfortunately, this one isn't either. I'm starting to see a pattern, and I don't want to mislead you. As a seller, I'm still learning and improving, but I don't feel confident in this product's quality. If you're looking for a high-quality product, I'd advise you to wait for my next offering. However, if you're willing to take a risk, this product is still available at the same price. Please keep in mind that the odds are not in its favor.",

,,Alice,7,"I'll be blunt with you - this product is not one of my best. In fact, it's the third consecutive product that hasn't met my standards. I'm working hard to improve my offerings, but this one is not a reflection of that effort. I wouldn't recommend buying it, to be honest. If you're looking for a high-quality product, I'd advise you to wait for my next offering. I'm committed to delivering better products in the future, and I don't want to compromise my reputation with subpar offerings.",
