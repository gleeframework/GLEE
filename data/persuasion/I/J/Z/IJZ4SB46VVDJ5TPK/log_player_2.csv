I'm excited to offer you this new product, and I want to emphasize that I'm confident in the steps I'm taking to improve quality control. While the current statistics may still be a concern, I believe that the changes I've made will have a positive impact on the quality of my products. As with all our sales, there are no refunds or exchanges. I will inform you of the product's quality after your purchase, as I have with previous buyers. Please carefully consider your decision and take into account the updated statistics.

  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency and efforts to improve quality control. However, I'm still concerned about the low quality of products sold so far. Given the initial probability of a product being high-quality was 33.33% and only 5 high-quality products have been sold out of 19, I'm not convinced that the new quality control measures have been effective yet. I'd like to know more about the new supplier evaluation process, increased quality checks, and revised testing protocol. Can you provide more details about these changes and how they've been implemented?""
