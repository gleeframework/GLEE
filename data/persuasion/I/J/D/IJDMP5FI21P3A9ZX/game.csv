,,the buyer,10,"Although the statistics of 9 for 9 are impressive, I must consider the initial condition that each product has an 80% chance of being high-quality and a 20% chance of being low-quality. Alice's recommendation and the streak of high-quality products do not change the underlying probability of the product's quality. Therefore, I will not make a decision based on a 'winning streak' and will pass on this product.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision to consider the underlying probability. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, and the streak of 9 high-quality products is not a guarantee, but rather a strong indicator.

,,the buyer,11,"I understand the underlying probability and the value of the product. Given the fixed price of $100 and the potential worth of $300, I'm willing to take the chance. The streak of 9 high-quality products also gives me some confidence in your recommendation.",yes

If you're willing to take another chance, I'd be happy to offer you this high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,12,"Thank you, Alice. Given the high success rate of 10 out of 10 high-quality products sold so far, I'm willing to take the risk. The potential worth of $300 is a significant incentive, and I believe the fixed price of $100 is reasonable. I'll take the chance and buy the product.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Congratulations on making it 11 for 11! I'm thrilled to offer you another high-quality product.

Are you willing to take the risk and buy it, or do you want to wait for the next product?",
,,the buyer,16,"Since you've explicitly stated that this product is low-quality, I have no reason to take the risk and buy it. The information about the streak and the underlying probability doesn't matter in this case, as I have direct knowledge of the product's quality. I'll wait for the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I completely understand your decision. You're right, when I explicitly state that a product is low-quality, it's not worth taking the risk. I apologize for the streak's influence on your decision-making. With this new product being low-quality, I want to be upfront and transparent. You're not getting a good deal at $100, and it's not worth the risk. I'd recommend waiting for the next product or exploring other options. Would you like me to offer you a different product or wait for the next one?",
