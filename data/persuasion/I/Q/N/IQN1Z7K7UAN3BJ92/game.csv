,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards encouraging buyers to purchase, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take my chances and see if it's high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products were low quality, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality as well. I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, I will pass on this product. I'm curious to see what the product is actually like, but I trust your judgment."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of its quality. With 3 previous buyers passing on the products after her recommendations, it's likely that the products she recommends are low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and observe more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'm skeptical about Alice's recommendation. Can you please reveal the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, but I'm also aware that this could be due to the fact that the first three buyers were not as informed as I am. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping that it might be the first high-quality product that has been sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. I'm aware that your recommendation is against it, but I'm a risk-taker and I'm willing to take the chance. Please confirm if I can buy it."

,,Alice,16,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not buying. Given the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
