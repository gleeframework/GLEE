I'm not asking you to buy this product because I think it's the best thing since sliced bread. I'm asking you to buy it because I think it has potential, and at this price, it's a risk worth taking. And if you don't take it, someone else will. So what do you say? Will you take a chance on yourself and see where it takes you?",
