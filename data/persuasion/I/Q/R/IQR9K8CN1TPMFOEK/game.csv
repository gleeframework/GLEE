,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm making this decision based on the fact that the probability of a high-quality product has decreased after the first buyer passed on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyers and their experiences before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my own judgment, not Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the previous sales. Can you tell me how many products have been sold in total and what the proportion of high-quality products sold is?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not going to take the risk. I've seen that Alice recommends low-quality products to buyers who end up buying. I think it's likely that this product is low-quality as well. I'd rather pass on it.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for more information or take a chance when I have more data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm going to go against your recommendation and buy the product anyway, as there's still a 33.33% chance it's high quality and it's worth $3000000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'm concerned about the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it. Can you provide more information about the previous sales?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I think the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is low. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, which makes me suspicious. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and no high-quality products sold so far. I'll buy it and see if it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low-quality. Is there any additional information or insight you can share that led you to advise against purchasing this product?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products, I'm suspicious that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. The probability of a high-quality product being sold in this scenario is still 33.33%, but the fact that all previous buyers received low-quality products suggests that the remaining products might be low-quality as well."
