Alice's message: I understand you're being cautious, but I assure you that this is a one-time offer. If you don't buy this low-quality product, I'll have to sell the high-quality ones at a higher price. Think of this as a 'loss leader' to get you a better deal in the long run. I'll give you a special deal: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next high-quality product you buy from me. Is that a good enough incentive?
