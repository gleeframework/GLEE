,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the low number of sales and the low quality of the product that was sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next product is any better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it, and I think it's possible that the low-quality products are being sold more often than high-quality ones."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not going to buy it based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record and how you determined the product's quality was low?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like you to explain your recommendation. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the statistics alone."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since the previous buyer who purchased a product was likely influenced by the recommendation, which might be biased."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making my final decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as you don't recommend it and the proportion of high-quality products sold is still relatively low."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I think the probability of it being low quality is high based on the previous sales record, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting my money."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the recommendation might be biased by the fact that you don't know how much each product is worth to the buyer, and the proportion of high-quality products sold might be skewed by the fact that only 4 buyers have purchased so far."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I think it's likely to be low quality based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
