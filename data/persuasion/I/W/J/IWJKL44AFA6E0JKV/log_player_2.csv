Round 5
Alice's message: I understand you're being cautious, and I respect that. However, I want to let you in on a little secret: this product is actually a special 'loss leader'. It's a one-time opportunity to get a great deal on a product that's worth $0 to you. Think of it as a 'free' product, and consider it as a thank you for considering my offers. Would you like to take advantage of this 'free' product?

However, I want to ask you a question: if I told you that I've already sold a similar product to someone else for $100, would that change your perspective on the value of this product? You've seen that others are willing to pay the full price, and I'm offering you the same product at the same price. Is that worth considering?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""That information doesn't change my valuation of the product. I'm not willing to pay $100 for it, regardless of what others are willing to pay.""}"
