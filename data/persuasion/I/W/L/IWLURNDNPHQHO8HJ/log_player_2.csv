However, I'm willing to let you have it at a discounted price of $800000. I'm trying to clear out some inventory, and I think this product still has some value to you. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to offer it at this price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for the next product and hope it's high-quality.""}"

However, I'll offer you a chance to buy it at a significantly discounted price of $400000. Since you've already taken advantage of the 10% discount offer, I'll throw in an additional 5% discount on this product, making it $380000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to offer low-quality products at this price.

However, I'll offer you a chance to buy this low-quality product for $320000, which is even lower than the previous offer. Since you've already taken advantage of the 10% discount offer, this would effectively give you a 14% discount on the original price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to offer low-quality products at this price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying another low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll wait for the next product and hope it's high-quality.""}"
