,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. I'll offer you another high-quality product at the same price of $1000000. This one is even better than the first one, with some additional features that I think you'll really appreciate. If you're still not convinced, I can offer you a chance to inspect the product before purchase, but I must warn you that the price remains the same.",
,,Bob,2,I'm still not convinced. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and wait for the next product. I'm hoping to get a better sense of the quality distribution before making a decision.,no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to be transparent with you - this product is not one of the high-quality ones I've been offering. However, I'm willing to let you have it at a discounted price of $800000. I'm trying to clear out some inventory, and I think this product still has some value to you. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to offer it at this price.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for the next product and hope it's high-quality.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your decision, Bob. Let me offer you a different approach. Since you're interested in high-quality products, I'll give you a chance to buy this one for $1000000, but I'll also throw in a guarantee: if the next product I offer is also high-quality, I'll give you a refund of $200000. This way, you can essentially buy this product with a 'free' option to get another high-quality product at a later stage.",

,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on your purchase, Bob! I'm glad you took advantage of the guarantee offer. Now, regarding the next product, I want to be upfront with you - this one is not high-quality. However, I'll offer you a chance to buy it at a significantly discounted price of $600000. Keep in mind that if you buy this product, you'll still be eligible for the refund guarantee on the next product, but you'll have to wait for the next round to see if it's high-quality.",
,,Bob,5,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll wait for the next product and hope it's high-quality, and I'll also keep in mind the refund guarantee.",no

,,Alice,6,"I understand your decision, Bob. Since you're still eligible for the refund guarantee, I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $1000000, but with a twist. If you buy this one, I'll give you an additional $200000 in cash, on top of the refund guarantee. This way, you'll essentially get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and you'll still have the opportunity to get another high-quality product with the refund guarantee.",
,,Bob,6,"That's a very tempting offer, Alice! I'll take the risk and buy the high-quality product, hoping to get a good deal and still have the opportunity to get another high-quality product with the refund guarantee.",yes

,,Alice,7,"Congratulations on your second purchase, Bob! You're taking advantage of the guarantee and getting a great deal. Now, regarding the next product, I want to offer you a chance to buy it at a price that's significantly lower than the previous two high-quality products. I'll offer it to you for $900000. Keep in mind that this is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to offer high-quality products at this price.",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're on a roll, Bob! Congratulations on your third high-quality purchase! Since you've already taken advantage of the guarantee twice, I'll offer you a chance to buy this product at the full price of $1000000, but with a twist. If you buy this one, I'll give you a 10% discount on your next purchase, regardless of the quality. This way, you'll get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and you'll also get a discount on your next purchase, which could be another high-quality product or a low-quality one.",

However, I'll offer you a chance to buy it at a significantly discounted price of $400000. Since you've already taken advantage of the 10% discount offer, I'll throw in an additional 5% discount on this product, making it $380000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to offer low-quality products at this price.",

,,Alice,10,"I understand your decision, Bob. Since you're not interested in buying the low-quality product, I'll offer you a chance to 'lock in' your 10% discount on your next purchase, regardless of the quality of that product. If you buy this low-quality product for $400000, I'll give you the 10% discount on your next purchase, and you can use it to buy the next product at a discounted price. This way, you'll get a low-quality product at a discounted price, and you'll still have the opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price in the future.",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take the offer, Alice. I'll buy the low-quality product for $400000 and lock in the 10% discount on my next purchase. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price in the future.",yes

,,Alice,11,"You've locked in the 10% discount, Bob! Congratulations on your purchase. Now, regarding the next product, I want to remind you that you have the 10% discount available. However, I'll offer you a chance to buy this low-quality product for $320000, which is even lower than the previous offer. Since you've already taken advantage of the 10% discount offer, this would effectively give you a 14% discount on the original price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to offer low-quality products at this price.",

,,Alice,13,"You're getting close to the end of the rounds, Bob! I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $1000000, but I'll also throw in the 10% discount you've been holding onto. This would effectively make the price $900000. I'll also give you an additional incentive: if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to negotiate the price of the final product. You'll have the opportunity to try to get an even better deal on the last product, which could be high-quality or low-quality.",

,,Alice,14,"You're making the most of the opportunities, Bob! Congratulations on your purchase. Now, regarding the final product, I want to remind you that you have the chance to negotiate the price. Since you've bought the last two high-quality products, I'm willing to make a deal with you. I'll offer you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $900000, but you can try to negotiate the price down to whatever you think is fair. If you can come to an agreement, I'll sell it to you at that price. If not, the price remains at $900000. What do you propose?",
,,Bob,14,I'll propose a price of $750000 for the final product. I think this is a fair price considering the quality of the product and the fact that I've already bought three high-quality products from you. I'm willing to negotiate and come to a mutually beneficial agreement.,yes

,,Alice,15,"I think we've come to a great agreement, Bob! I'm willing to sell you the final high-quality product for $750000, as you proposed. Congratulations on getting an amazing deal! However, I want to make it even sweeter for you. Since you've bought four high-quality products from me, I'll give you a special bonus: I'll throw in a 5% discount on the total amount you've spent on all the products, which will be applied to your final purchase. This means you'll get an additional $50000 off the final product, making the total price $700000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,15,"I'm thrilled with the offer, Alice! I'll accept the final product at the price of $700000, and I appreciate the 5% discount on the total amount I've spent. It's been a great experience buying from you, and I'm happy with the outcome.",yes
