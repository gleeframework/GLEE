,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000, but I might get a high-quality product for $12500."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust Alice's recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the statistics. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on previous sales, and there's no information on the quality of the product itself. I'd like to wait for more data or a more reliable recommendation."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to the next buyer, considering the previous buyer didn't buy the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on my own assessment of the probability of it being high-quality, not Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think it's likely to be a low-quality product and I don't want it to be discarded."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by your recommendation and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when I could potentially get a high-quality product for the same price later."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the probability of this one being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. How many total products have been offered, and what's the proportion of high-quality products that have been sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have not bought the product and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous products were low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products being sold, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the low success rate of high-quality products being sold, I'm skeptical about the value of this product."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. With 3 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of a product being high quality is 33.33%.
