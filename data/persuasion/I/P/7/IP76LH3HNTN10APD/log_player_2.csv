**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommending the product is a strong signal, as she has access to information we don't.
* **The statistics:**  The sales record is still limited, but the fact that a high-quality product was already sold increases the probability that the current product is also high-quality.

While the odds are still in favor of a low-quality product, the combination of Alice's recommendation and the positive sales statistic makes buying the product a worthwhile gamble."
