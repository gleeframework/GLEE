,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just take the product and see what I get."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm the second buyer, and the previous buyer didn't buy the product. This suggests that the previous buyer may have been more cautious or had different information. Given the 50/50 chance of the product being high-quality, I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that the previous two buyers also passed, and Alice's recommendation doesn't change my probability assessment of the product being high-quality. I'd like to see more information about the sales record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers also passed on the products, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%.

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the product I'd get is likely to be low-quality, given the 50% chance of high-quality and 50% chance of low-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."
