``` 

**Explanation:**

* **No information from previous sales:** Since no products have been sold yet, there's no data to base a decision on other than the odds.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  While Alice's recommendation doesn't guarantee quality, it's a signal that she believes the product is worth buying. It's a slight positive factor.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward ($30,000) is significantly higher than the potential loss ($10,000).  The odds are against you, but the payoff is large enough to justify taking the risk in this initial instance."

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you, Alice! I appreciate your recommendation. I'm going to purchase the product. ""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:**  While there is a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, the fact that Alice, who knows the quality, recommends buying it strongly suggests it is a high-quality product. 
* **Positive Track Record:** With one high-quality product already sold out of one purchase, Alice's recommendations seem to be accurate.
* **Potential Gain vs. Loss:**  If the product is high quality, you gain $20,000. If it's low quality, you lose $10,000. Given the high likelihood of it being high quality based on the information available, the potential gain outweighs the risk."
