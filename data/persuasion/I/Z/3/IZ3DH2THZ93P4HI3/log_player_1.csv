"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You should recommend Bob to buy the product in this round. Here's why:

* **The product is high-quality:** This means Bob will get a value of $400 from it.
* **The price is $100:**  This is significantly lower than the value Bob receives from a high-quality product. 
* **There is no risk of losing money:** Even if the product were low-quality, Bob would only lose $100, which is a small price to pay for the potential gain of $300. 

Since the potential gain far outweighs the potential loss, it's a good decision for Bob to buy the product."
