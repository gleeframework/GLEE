,,Alice,2,"You've already bought one low-quality product for $1000000. I'm offering you another product for the same price. If you buy this one, you'll be doubling your investment. However, keep in mind that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold you two products so far, one low-quality and one high-quality. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, it's likely that the next product will also be low-quality. I'm willing to offer you a discount on this one - I'll sell it to you for $900000. This is a 10% discount from the original price.",

,,Alice,5,"You're right to wait for a high-quality product! I've got another one for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for the original price of $1000000. Since you've already seen two products, one high-quality and one low-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. However, given the pattern, it's possible that the next product might be low-quality. I'm willing to offer you a guarantee: if this product is high-quality, I'll give you a $100000 refund on the next product you buy. This way, you'll get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and a potential refund on the next one.",

The refund will be added to your account, so you can use it towards the next product. I'll keep the same price of $1000000 for this low-quality product. However, I'll give you an additional incentive: if you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next product to you before you have to decide whether to buy it.

I'll offer you another high-quality product, but this time, I'll give you an even better deal. I'll sell it to you for $850000, which is an 15% discount from the original price. However, I'll also throw in an additional incentive: if you buy this product, I'll give you the option to 'lock in' the price of the next product at the original $1000000, regardless of its quality.

I'll sell you this low-quality product for $700000, which is a 30% discount from the original price.

I'll give you a 'get out of jail free' card: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you the option to skip the next round and come back to me in Round 13.

I'll sell you this low-quality product for $600000, which is a 40% discount from the original price.
