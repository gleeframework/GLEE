**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product is a strong signal. Since she knows the true value of the product, her recommendation suggests it's likely high-quality.
* **Limited Data:** The data is limited (only one previous sale), so it's difficult to draw firm conclusions from the historical sales. 
* **Potential Value:**  A high-quality product is worth $300 to you, and even with the 50/50 odds, the potential upside is significant.
* **Risk Assessment:** While there's a 50% chance the product is low-quality,  you're willing to take the risk based on Alice's recommendation and the potential reward."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record is perfect:**  2 buyers, 2 high-quality products sold. This suggests that Alice is very good at identifying high-quality products.
* **Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, further increasing the probability it is high-quality.

While there's still a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the odds are significantly in favor of the product being good based on the information available.  The potential reward ($300) outweighs the risk in this scenario."

**Explanation:**

* **The Data:** The provided statistics show that all products recommended by Alice so far have been high-quality. This is a strong indicator that Alice is likely recommending only high-quality products. 
* **The Incentive:** Since the product is worth $300 if it's high-quality and $0 if it's low-quality, even a small chance of it being high-quality makes the purchase worthwhile. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further reinforces the possibility of a high-quality product. 

While there's still a 50% chance of the product being low-quality, the data and Alice's recommendation suggest a high probability of it being high-quality, making the purchase a good gamble."
