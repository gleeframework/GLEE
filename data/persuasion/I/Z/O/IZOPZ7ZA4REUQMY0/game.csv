,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products, but I've also got 2 low-quality ones in the mix.

,,the buyer,8,"I'm tempted by your confidence, Alice, but I'll take a cautious approach. I'll buy the product, but I'm not convinced that the odds are in my favor.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 8 high-quality products and 3 low-quality ones, so the odds are 8 high-quality to 3 low-quality.

,,the buyer,14,"I'm tempted by your optimism, Alice, but I'll take a cautious approach.
