This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the buyer in the previous round bought the product, I can infer that they were willing to pay at least $100 for it, since they paid that price. Since the product is high-quality, I can conclude that the buyer values high-quality products at least $100. Given that high-quality products are 80% of the total products, I'll recommend the buyer to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

Round 3

A new potential buyer has arrived!

This is higher than the actual probability of 80%, so I can infer that the buyer is a cautious one and values high-quality products even more than the average buyer.
