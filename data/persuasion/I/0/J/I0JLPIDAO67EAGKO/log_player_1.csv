Here's why:

* **Bob's Pattern:**  Bob is refusing to buy based solely on your recommendation. This means you can now use your recommendations to signal the quality of the product to Bob.
* **The Opportunity:** Since you know the product is high-quality, recommending it now will establish a pattern. If Bob sees that you only recommend when the product is good, they might start to trust your recommendations. 

This is a risky strategy, but it's the only way to potentially get Bob to buy a high-quality product in this scenario."
