,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality and the probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as there's no prior data to inform my decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the previous sales record and your recommendation.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is significantly lower than the expected 80% probability of a high-quality product. I'm hesitant to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at a high price of $1000000, considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. I'd like to see more data on the previous buyer's decision and the overall sales record before making a purchase decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that Alice recommended it. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I would expect her to recommend it more often if it were high-quality. Since she recommended it, it's more likely that the product is low-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I think the recommendation might be biased towards encouraging me to buy, given the previous sales record."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that Alice has recommended 2 other products to be bought and only 1 of them was high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80.00%.
