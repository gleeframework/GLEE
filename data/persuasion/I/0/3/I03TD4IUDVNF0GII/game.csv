,,Alice,5,"I've sold four products now, with three of them being high-quality. I'm starting to feel a bit like I'm on a roll, but I don't want to get too cocky. This next product is a bit of a wild card - I'm not making any promises about its quality. In fact, I'll be honest with you, I'm a bit worried that it might be a dud. But hey, that's why the price is so low, right? $1000000 is still a steal for a product of any quality. So, what do you say? Want to take a chance on it?",

But I'm not going to get too comfortable - I know that streaks can turn around quickly. This next product is... well, I'm not going to sugarcoat it - I think it's a bit of a dud. But hey, you might be able to find some value in it. I'm willing to sell it to you for the full $1000000, but I'll throw in a bonus: if you buy it, I'll give you a detailed breakdown of my sales data, including the quality of each product and the buyer's reaction to it.
