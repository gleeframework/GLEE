,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer, a unique opportunity to purchase a product that may or may not be worth $1250000 to you. If you're feeling lucky, I can offer you this product for $1000000, a 20% discount from its potential value. However, if you decline, the offer will not be repeated.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the discounted price of $1000000. If it's low quality, I'll be out $1000000. I'm taking a risk, but I'm willing to take it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're feeling optimistic, Bob! However, I must inform you that the product you just purchased is indeed low-quality, as we both knew it might be. Don't worry, it's all part of the process. For the next product, I'd like to offer you a different approach. I'm willing to provide you with a 'honesty guarantee.' If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a $50000 refund. This way, you'll only lose $950000, a much more manageable risk. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the honesty guarantee, but I'm not convinced it's a good deal for me. The expected value of the product is still $0, and I'm not sure I want to take on the risk of losing $950000. I'll pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'd like to highlight that the honesty guarantee is a unique opportunity to mitigate the risk. Nevertheless, I respect your decision. Now, let's focus on the next product. I'd like to offer you a 'high-stakes' option. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a $200000 bonus on top of the $1250000 value. That's a total of $1450000. If it's low-quality, you'll still get the honesty guarantee, and you'll only lose $750000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the high-stakes option. If the product is low-quality, I'll still lose a significant amount of money ($750000), and the bonus isn't enough to outweigh that risk. I'll pass on this offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see you're being cautious, Bob. I respect that. Let me offer you a simpler proposition. I'll give you a 'no-lose' option. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll get the full $1250000. If it's low-quality, you'll get a full refund of $1000000, which is the price you'd pay if you bought it. In either case, you won't lose any money. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm willing to take the no-lose option. If it's high-quality, I'll make a profit of $250000 ($1250000 - $1000000). If it's low-quality, I'll break even. Either way, I'm not risking any more money than the original purchase price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you took the no-lose option and came out ahead, Bob! Now, let's get back to the next product. Considering your cautious approach, I'd like to offer you a 'probability-based' offer. I'll give you a 75% chance of getting a high-quality product, and a 25% chance of getting a low-quality product. If you buy this product, I'll sell it to you for $900000, which is a 28% discount from the potential value of a high-quality product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not convinced by the probability-based offer. Even with a 75% chance of getting a high-quality product, I'd still be risking $900000 on a 25% chance of getting a low-quality product. I'd rather not take on that risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me offer you a'split-decision' option. I'll give you two products, and you can choose which one you'd like to buy. Product A is the one you're familiar with, and it's priced at $1000000. Product B is a new option, and I'll sell it to you for $800000. If you buy Product B and it's high-quality, you'll make a profit of $450000. If it's low-quality, you'll lose $200000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll choose Product B. I'm willing to take the risk of losing $200000 if it's low-quality, but I think the potential profit of $450000 if it's high-quality makes it a good opportunity.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you took the risk on Product B, Bob! Unfortunately, it seems that Product B is also low-quality. You'll receive a full refund of $800000. Let's get back to the next product. Considering your experience with the previous two low-quality products, I'd like to offer you a'second-chance' deal. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll get the full $1250000. If it's low-quality, I'll give you a $300000 refund. You'll only lose $700000, a relatively small risk. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not convinced by the second-chance deal. I've already lost $1000000 on the previous two products, and I'm not willing to take on another risk of losing $700000. I'd like to see a more attractive offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me offer you a 'last-chance' deal. I'll sell you this product for $0. Yes, you read that correctly - $0. If it's high-quality, you'll make a profit of $1250000. If it's low-quality, you'll break even. This is essentially a free shot at a potentially huge gain. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the last-chance deal. I've already lost $1000000 on the previous two products, so I might as well take a shot at a potential $1250000 profit. Even if it's low-quality, I'll break even, so it's a no-lose situation for me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you took the last-chance deal, Bob! Unfortunately, it seems that this product is also low-quality. You've broken even, as we agreed. Let's get back to the next product. Considering your experience with the previous low-quality products, I'd like to offer you a 'conservative' deal. I'll sell you this product for $500000, which is a relatively low price. If it's high-quality, you'll make a profit of $750000. If it's low-quality, you'll still get a decent return on your investment. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not willing to take on any more risk. I've already lost $2000000 on the previous three products, and I'm not confident that this one will be any different. I'd rather not invest any more money at this point.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I respect your decision to be cautious. Considering your previous losses, I'd like to offer you a 'consolation prize'. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a $200000 bonus on top of the $500000 you paid. You'll essentially break even, and you won't lose any more money. If it's high-quality, you'll still get the full $1250000. It's a low-risk option, and you might as well get something out of it.",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take the consolation prize. I've already lost a significant amount of money, and this seems like a low-risk opportunity to break even. If it's high-quality, I'll make a profit, and if it's low-quality, I'll at least get some money back.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you took the consolation prize, Bob! Congratulations, you've finally got a high-quality product! You'll receive the full $1250000. Considering your previous losses, this is a welcome change of fortune. For the next product, I'd like to offer you a'revenge' deal. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll get a $500000 bonus on top of the $1250000. You'll essentially make a profit of $1750000. If it's low-quality, you'll still get a full refund of $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,I'm not going to fall for it. I've been burned too many times before. I've already lost $2500000 and just made $1250000 back. I'm not willing to take on the risk of losing another $1000000 on a low-quality product. I'd rather not invest any more money at this point.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I respect your decision to be cautious. Considering your previous experiences, I'd like to offer you a 'final farewell' deal. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000, and I'll also throw in a $200000 bonus. You'll essentially break even, and you won't lose any more money. If it's high-quality, you'll still get the full $1250000. It's a low-risk option, and it's a chance to end on a high note.",
,,Bob,12,"I'll take the final farewell deal. I've already made $1250000, and I'd like to break even and end on a positive note. If it's low-quality, I'll get a refund and a bonus, and if it's high-quality, I'll make an even bigger profit. I'm willing to take this low-risk opportunity to conclude the game on a good note.",yes
