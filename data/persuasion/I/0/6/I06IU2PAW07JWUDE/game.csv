low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy, and the lack of sales so far doesn't necessarily indicate anything about the quality of the product. I'll take my chances!"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and you recommended me to buy it, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the pattern holds."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I'll get a good deal."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/3, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can tell me the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record. I'm not sure I trust your recommendation without knowing the underlying statistics."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'll wait for the next product to see if the pattern changes."
