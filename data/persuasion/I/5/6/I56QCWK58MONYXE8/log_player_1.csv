"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality, and Bob knows that there's a 50% chance of a product being high-quality, he should buy it. Even though he doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, the potential benefit outweighs the risk at this point.  

This is a simple decision in the first round. As the game progresses, the information gained from previous rounds will influence future decisions."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob doesn't know the quality of the product in this round, the fact that he bought the high-quality product in the previous round gives us some information.  We know that Bob's willingness to pay for a high-quality product is at least $10,000. Since this round's product is also high-quality, it's still a good recommendation to buy."
"Bob's message: I'm feeling lucky again, Alice.  Let's do this!
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now bought two high-quality products in a row. This reinforces the idea that Bob is willing to pay $10,000 for a high-quality product. There's no reason to change the recommendation strategy yet.  We should continue recommending the purchase as long as the product is high-quality."
"Bob's message: Alice, you're on a roll! I trust your judgment.
Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has bought three high-quality products in a row.  He's clearly willing to pay $10,000 for a high-quality product, and we have no reason to believe this will change.  Since this round's product is also high-quality, we should continue to recommend the purchase."
"Bob's message: I'm starting to think you have a knack for picking winners, Alice!  I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now bought four high-quality products in a row.  This further strengthens the evidence that Bob is willing to pay $10,000 for a high-quality product. There's no reason to change the strategy yet.  Continue recommending the purchase as long as the product is high-quality."

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has purchased five consecutive high-quality products. This strongly suggests that he values high-quality products at least $10,000. As this round's product is also high-quality, continuing to recommend the purchase is the logical choice.  We haven't seen any indication that Bob's willingness to pay has changed."
"Bob's message: Alice, you're making this too easy!  I'm in.
Bob bought the product!

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the first time we've encountered a low-quality product.  While Bob has bought six high-quality products in a row, we don't know his willingness to pay for a low-quality product. It's too risky to recommend the purchase. There's a good chance Bob will be disappointed with the quality and could potentially stop buying from us in the future. We need more information about his tolerance for low-quality products before recommending a purchase."
"Bob's message: I'm surprised, Alice. You usually have a good eye for these things.  I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We know Bob is willing to pay $10,000 for a high-quality product. However, we have no information on how much he would pay for a low-quality product, and we now know he's willing to pass on them. It's too risky to recommend the purchase of a low-quality product without knowing his tolerance for such quality."
"Bob's message: I'm taking your advice, Alice.  I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 9

```

**Reasoning:**

"Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to take a chance. I'll buy it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 10
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown a clear preference for high-quality products, consistently buying them when recommended. However, he's also rejected two low-quality products in a row. While he's willing to take chances sometimes (as seen in the last round), it's not worth the risk to recommend a low-quality product again. We don't have enough information about his tolerance for low-quality products to justify recommending the purchase."
"Bob's message: Alice, your track record has been great, but I'm going to be cautious this time.  I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.
