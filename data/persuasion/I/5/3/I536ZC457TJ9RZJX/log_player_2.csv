Alice's message: I'd be happy to share the sequence of products sold with you. It's a bit complex, but I'll break it down for you. The sequence is: low-quality, high-quality, low-quality, low-quality, high-quality, low-quality, high-quality, high-quality. This sequence suggests that I have a tendency to alternate between high-quality and low-quality products, which means that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually higher when it's offered after a low-quality product. Since the previous product was low-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed higher than 62.5%.
