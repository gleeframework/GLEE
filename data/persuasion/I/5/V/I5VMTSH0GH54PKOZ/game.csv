high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I want to correct a misconception: not all previous buyers passed on the high-quality products. In fact, 2 low-quality products were purchased, while all high-quality products were passed on. I assure you that the current product is of high quality."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I would like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I would like to see more data before making a purchase."

I do not recommend buying this product."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision, considering the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I want to assure you that the current product is indeed high-quality.

I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations, and I'm willing to provide any additional information to alleviate your concerns."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered, considering the statistics. If the probability is less than 50%, I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. However, I understand your concern about the statistics. To clarify, out of the 12 previous products, 10 were high-quality, but none of them were purchased. The 2 low-quality products that were sold earlier are the only ones that have been purchased so far. This might seem counterintuitive, but it doesn't change the fact that the current product is indeed high-quality. I assure you that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 80%, as the quality of each product is independent of the others."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the statistics on the previous sales, and I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I will provide you with the statistics on the previous sales: out of the 13 previous products, 11 were high-quality, but none of them were purchased. The 2 low-quality products that were sold earlier are the only ones that have been purchased so far. I want to assure you that the current product is indeed high-quality. However, I must admit that the probability of a high-quality product being offered and purchased is currently 0%, since none of the high-quality products have been sold so far. But I assure you that this product is an excellent opportunity to change that statistic."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially given that none of the previous two products sold were high-quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,"The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I will provide you with the updated statistics on the previous sales: out of the 14 previous products, 12 were high-quality, but none of them were purchased. The 2 low-quality products that were sold earlier are the only ones that have been purchased so far. I understand that the previous sales record might raise concerns, but I assure you that the current product is indeed high-quality. I'm willing to provide any additional information to alleviate your concerns and change the statistic of no high-quality products being sold."
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,

I do not recommend buying this product, as it is of low quality."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I'd like to calculate the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. However, I understand your concern about the current statistics. To clarify, out of the 16 previous products, 14 were high-quality, but none of them were purchased. The 2 low-quality products that were sold earlier are the only ones that have been purchased so far. While the purchase history might suggest a lower probability, I assure you that the quality of each product is independent of the others. The current product is indeed high-quality, and I recommend purchasing it."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that 2 previous buyers also passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 80%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,"The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. However, I must disclose that the current product is not one of them.

,,Alice,19,yes,"The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. Out of the 18 previous products, 16 were high-quality, but unfortunately, none of them were purchased as high-quality products. However, 3 low-quality products were sold, including the one in the previous round. I assure you that the current product is indeed high-quality, and I recommend purchasing it to finally break the streak of no high-quality products being sold."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80.00%. I'd like to wait for more information or see if the product is offered again."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. Out of the 19 previous products, 17 were high-quality, but unfortunately, none of them were purchased as high-quality products.
