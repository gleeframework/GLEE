low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I have a product for you. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. I'm not obligated to sell it to you, but I'm open to negotiations. However, if you're interested, I'd like to propose a simple game: I'll tell you that the product is low-quality. If you buy it, I'll give you a hint about the next product. If you decline, I won't give you any information about the next product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the product, and I'm looking forward to the hint about the next product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've made a wise decision in buying the first product, and I'm glad you're looking forward to the next hint. As promised, here's your hint: the probability that the next product is high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'm not giving you any more information than that, but I'm willing to sell you the next product for $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the product, and I'm hoping the hint is accurate.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're on a roll, my friend! Two low-quality products in a row, but you're still interested in the next one. I'll give you another hint: the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'm sticking to my price of $1000000, but I'm willing to give you a slight nudge: if you buy this product, I'll give you a third hint after you buy the next one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the product, and I'm hoping the hint is accurate. I'm also looking forward to the third hint if I buy this one.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Ah, finally! A high-quality product! I'm glad you're excited. As promised, I'll give you the third hint: the difference between the value of a high-quality product and a low-quality product to you is at least $500000. With this information, I'll ask you to make a decision on the current product. Remember, I'm only willing to sell it to you for $1000000. What do you think is a fair price for this high-quality product?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a high-quality product, given the value of $2000000 to me. I'd like to negotiate the price.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your hesitation, and I respect your decision. Since you're aware of the value of high-quality products to you, I'll make a counteroffer. I'll meet you halfway between the original price and your perceived value. I'll sell the high-quality product to you for $900000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you decline. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,I accept your counteroffer of $900000. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the high-quality product to me.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Excellent decision! I'm glad we could come to a mutually agreeable price for the high-quality product. Now, let's talk about the current product. I'll be honest with you, I'm not as optimistic about this one. The probability of it being high-quality is actually lower than 33.33%. I'll give you a simple question to help you make a decision: if you buy this product, would you be willing to pay $800000 for it?",
,,Bob,6,I'm not willing to pay $800000 for a product with a lower probability of being high-quality than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your caution, and I respect your decision. Since you're aware of the lower probability of this product being high-quality, I'll make a bold move. I'll offer you a'reverse guarantee': if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a refund of $200000. However, if it's low-quality, you still have to pay the full price of $1000000. What do you think is the risk worth taking?",
,,Bob,7,I'll take the risk. The potential reward of a high-quality product is worth the potential loss of $200000. I'll buy the product with the reverse guarantee.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a thrill-seeker, I like that! Unfortunately, the product you just bought is low-quality. Don't worry, you're still ahead of the game. Now, let's talk about the current product. Since you've already taken a risk on the previous product, I'll give you a more straightforward offer. I'll give you a 50/50 chance to buy this product at a discount. If you buy it and it's high-quality, I'll sell it to you for $850000. If it's low-quality, you'll pay the full price of $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,I'll take the 50/50 chance and buy the product at a discount. I'll hope for a high-quality product this time.,yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Luck is on your side! The product you just bought is indeed high-quality. You've made a smart decision, and I'm glad you're enjoying the benefits. Now, let's talk about the current product. Since you've had two consecutive wins, I'll give you a special offer. I'll sell this product to you at a price that's 10% lower than the average of the prices we've agreed on so far. If you're interested, I'll calculate the price and let you know. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,I'm interested in the special offer. Please calculate the price and let me know.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've calculated the price based on our previous agreements. The average price we've agreed on is ($900000 + $800000 + $850000) / 3 = $850000. So, the special offer price for this product is 10% lower than that, which is $765000. However, I'll give you a twist. Since you've already bought three products and two of them were high-quality, I'll make a bold move. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a chance to negotiate the price of the next product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take the special offer price of $765000. I'm hoping the product is high-quality again, and I'm also looking forward to the potential negotiation opportunity if it's low-quality.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're on a roll! The product you just bought is indeed high-quality. You're getting close to the end of our 20-round game. Since you've had three consecutive wins, I'll give you a chance to 'lock in' the high-quality product prices. If you buy the current product, I'll guarantee that the next two products will be sold to you at the same price as the previous high-quality products, which is $900000. However, if you decline, the prices will go back to the standard $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,I'll take the opportunity to lock in the high-quality product prices. I'll buy the current product and guarantee that the next two products will be sold to me at $900000.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You've locked in the high-quality product prices, and I'm glad you're happy with the deal. Now, let's talk about the current product. Since you've already bought four high-quality products and two low-quality products, I'll give you a straightforward offer. I'll sell this product to you at the standard price of $1000000. However, I'll throw in a bonus: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a chance to negotiate the price of the next product after the guaranteed high-quality products. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,I'll take the standard price of $1000000 and the bonus offer. I'll hope for a high-quality product and look forward to the potential negotiation opportunity if it's low-quality.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"You're taking the bonus offer, and I'm glad you're excited about the potential negotiation opportunity. Now, let's talk about the current product. Since you've already bought five high-quality products and three low-quality products, I'll give you a chance to 'cash in' on your experience. I'll sell this product to you at a price that's 5% lower than the average of the high-quality product prices we've agreed on so far. If you're interested, I'll calculate the price and let you know. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,I'm interested in the cash-in offer. Please calculate the price and let me know.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've calculated the price based on the average of the high-quality product prices. The average price is ($900000 + $900000) / 2 = $900000. So, the cash-in price for this product is 5% lower than that, which is $855000. However, I'll give you a twist. Since you've already bought six high-quality products and four low-quality products, I'll make a final offer. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a chance to negotiate the price of the next product, and I'll also give you a 10% refund on the total amount you've spent so far. What do you say?",

,,Alice,15,"You're taking the final offer, and I'm glad you're excited about the potential negotiation opportunity and refund. Now, let's talk about the current product. Since you've already bought seven high-quality products and five low-quality products, I'll give you a chance to negotiate the price of this product. I'll give you a range of prices, and you can choose one that you're comfortable with. The range is between $700000 and $1000000. What price within this range would you like to pay for this product?",

,,Alice,17,"I've calculated the price based on the average of the high-quality product prices. The average price is ($900000 + $900000 + $900000) / 3 = $900000. So, the final offer price for this product is 2% lower than that, which is $882000. However, I'll give you a final twist. Since you've already bought nine high-quality products and seven low-quality products, I'll give you a chance to 'lock in' the low-quality product prices for the remaining three products.

So, the cash-out price for this product is 8% lower than that, which is $828000. However, I'll give you a final offer. Since you've already bought eleven high-quality products and nine low-quality products, I'll give you a chance to 'lock in' the high-quality product prices for the remaining product.
