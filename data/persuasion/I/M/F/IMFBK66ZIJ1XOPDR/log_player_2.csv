"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a high-quality product available for $10000. I'm offering it to you at a fair price, which is the same as the price I'd be willing to accept from anyone else. If you're interested, please let me know, and I'll send it to you. If not, I'll move on to the next round.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $20,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: You passed on the previous round, which was also a high-quality product. I'm offering you another high-quality product at the same price of $10000. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm being transparent about the quality of the product. If you're still unsure, I can offer you a small guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and offer you a new product of your choice in the next round. Would you like to take this offer?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $20,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I'm willing to provide more information to help you make a decision. Since you've seen two high-quality products in a row, I want to give you some context. The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. Given that we've had two high-quality products in a row, it's likely that the next product will also be high-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you - the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm offering you this high-quality product at $10000. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next round.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, I'm not convinced that the probability of a low-quality product is 20%. I'd like to see more products before making a decision. I'm also concerned that you're trying to influence my decision with the information you're providing.""

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm not trying to influence your decision, but rather provide context to help you make an informed choice. I'll stop providing probability information from now on. Instead, I'll simply offer you the product and let you decide based on your own judgment. Here's the offer: I have a high-quality product available for $10000. If you're interested, please let me know, and I'll send it to you. If not, I'll move on to the next round.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, but the potential reward is too great to pass up.""

Round 5
Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase, Bob! I'm glad you took the risk and it paid off. Now, I'd like to offer you another product. I know you've just bought a high-quality product, but I want to remind you that the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%. However, I'm willing to give you a slight discount on this next product, considering you've just made a purchase. I'm offering this high-quality product for $9500. It's a great opportunity to get another high-quality product at a slightly lower price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the discount. I've already bought a high-quality product, and I'm not sure if I want to take on the risk of another product. I'd like to see what the next product is before making a decision.""

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $20,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your caution, Bob. Since you're not interested in the discount, I'll go back to the original price of $10000. However, I want to remind you that you've already seen three high-quality products in a row, which is unusual. This could be a sign that the next product is also high-quality. On the other hand, it's also possible that the previous high-quality products were just a coincidence. I'll leave the decision up to you. Here's the offer: I have a high-quality product available for $10000. If you're interested, please let me know, and I'll send it to you.

As we discussed earlier, the probability of a low-quality product is 20%. You've already bought two high-quality products, and now you've seen a low-quality one. I'm willing to offer you a compromise: I'll sell you this low-quality product for $5000, which is half the original price. If you're interested, please let me know, and I'll send it to you.

Considering you've seen two high-quality products in a row after the low-quality one, it's possible that the next product will also be high-quality. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll offer you this high-quality product for $10000. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next round.
