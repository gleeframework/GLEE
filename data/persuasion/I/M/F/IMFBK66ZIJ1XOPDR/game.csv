high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You passed on the previous round, which was also a high-quality product. I'm offering you another high-quality product at the same price of $10000. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm being transparent about the quality of the product. If you're still unsure, I can offer you a small guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and offer you a new product of your choice in the next round. Would you like to take this offer?",

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm willing to provide more information to help you make a decision. Since you've seen two high-quality products in a row, I want to give you some context. The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. Given that we've had two high-quality products in a row, it's likely that the next product will also be high-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you - the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm offering you this high-quality product at $10000. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next round.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, I'm not convinced that the probability of a low-quality product is 20%. I'd like to see more products before making a decision. I'm also concerned that you're trying to influence my decision with the information you're providing.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm not trying to influence your decision, but rather provide context to help you make an informed choice.

Here's the offer: I have a high-quality product available for $10000. If you're interested, please let me know, and I'll send it to you. If not, I'll move on to the next round.",

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on your purchase, Bob! I'm glad you took the risk and it paid off. Now, I'd like to offer you another product. I know you've just bought a high-quality product, but I want to remind you that the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%. However, I'm willing to give you a slight discount on this next product, considering you've just made a purchase. I'm offering this high-quality product for $9500. It's a great opportunity to get another high-quality product at a slightly lower price.",

,,Alice,6,"I understand your caution, Bob. Since you're not interested in the discount, I'll go back to the original price of $10000. However, I want to remind you that you've already seen three high-quality products in a row, which is unusual. This could be a sign that the next product is also high-quality. On the other hand, it's also possible that the previous high-quality products were just a coincidence. I'll leave the decision up to you. Here's the offer: I have a high-quality product available for $10000. If you're interested, please let me know, and I'll send it to you.",

As we discussed earlier, the probability of a low-quality product is 20%. You've already bought two high-quality products, and now you've seen a low-quality one. I'm willing to offer you a compromise: I'll sell you this low-quality product for $5000, which is half the original price. If you're interested, please let me know, and I'll send it to you.",
