,,Alice,2,"I understand you're a savvy buyer, Bob. I'll be upfront with you - this product is not the best quality, but I'm willing to let it go for the low price of $10000. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's still worth something to you, even if it's not the top-of-the-line model. Plus, think of it as a chance to practice your negotiation skills for the next round!",

,,Alice,4,"Bob, I'm glad you're happy with your previous purchase! Now, I've got another product for you. I know you're on a roll, and I'm willing to make another deal. This one's a bit of a risk, but I'll let you in on a secret: I've already sold you a high-quality product in the previous round, so the probability of this one being high-quality is actually lower than usual. But, I'll give you an even better deal than before - I'll sell it to you for $9000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself!",
