high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'll pass on this one, I don't have enough information to make an informed decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,I'll take the product. I'll try to take advantage of the fact that I know that the previous product was high-quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'll pass on this one. Given that Alice didn't recommend it, I'm going to assume it's likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"I'm sticking with my previous assumption that Alice is more likely to recommend high-quality products. Since she didn't recommend this one, I'm passing."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,I'm still not convinced that Alice's recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll take the product. Two out of the last three products Alice recommended were high-quality, so I'm starting to think that her recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'm going to take a chance on this one. Since I've had two high-quality products recommended by Alice and two low-quality ones not recommended by her, I'm starting to think that her recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality, but not a perfect one. I'll buy this one and see what happens."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation this time. Given the last product she didn't recommend turned out to be low-quality, I'm going to assume this one might be low-quality too."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'll take the product. Three out of the last five products Alice recommended were high-quality, so I'm starting to think that her recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Given that Alice has recommended three high-quality products out of the last five, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the probability of it being low-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation this time. The last product she didn't recommend turned out to be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying another low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. The last product Alice recommended was high-quality, and the last product she didn't recommend was also high-quality, so I'm starting to think that her lack of recommendation might not be a reliable indicator of the product's quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"I'm not going to fall for it again. The last two products Alice didn't recommend turned out to be low-quality, and I'm starting to think that her recommendation might be a better indicator of the product's quality than her lack of recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. The last two products Alice didn't recommend turned out to be high-quality, so I'm starting to think that her lack of recommendation might not be a reliable indicator of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm going to take a chance on this one. The last three products Alice didn't recommend turned out to be low-quality, so I'm starting to think that her lack of recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'll take the product. Given the last three products Alice didn't recommend turned out to be low-quality, I'm willing to take a chance on a product she recommends, especially since it's a 50/50 chance of being high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'll take the product. The last product Alice recommended turned out to be high-quality, and the last product she didn't recommend turned out to be low-quality, so I'm going to trust her recommendation this time."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'll take the product. I've had a pretty good track record with Alice's recommendations lately, so I'm going to go with my gut and buy this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I'm going to take a chance on this one. The last three products Alice recommended turned out to be high-quality, and the last product she didn't recommend turned out to be low-quality, so I'm starting to think that her lack of recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality, but I'm not 100% confident in that."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I'm going to take a chance on this one. I've had a bit of a streak of bad luck with Alice's lack of recommendations, but I'm not going to let that stop me from trying to find a high-quality product. I'll take the risk and buy this one."
