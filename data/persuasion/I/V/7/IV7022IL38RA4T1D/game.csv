It's a $50000 value, absolutely free. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the bonus offer, Alice, but I'm still hesitant to buy without knowing the product's quality. The personalized consultation is a nice touch, but it's not worth $1000000 to me if the product is low-quality. Can I see the next product and make a decision based on its quality?",no
