,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because I don't have any information to go on yet and I'd rather not pass on the opportunity to buy the first product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,

,,the buyer,2,yes,I'm willing to take the risk despite Alice's recommendation. I'd like to buy the product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on Alice's recommendation and the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products being offered. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any different."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to know more about the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. Out of 2 previous recommendations, none of the products were high quality, which suggests that Alice's recommendation may not be a good indicator of the product's quality. I'd rather wait and see if the next buyer gets a high-quality product, or try to negotiate a lower price."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about its quality and Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any useful information. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 3 products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 3 purchases, and considering the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations have been accurate so far, and none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product. Given the 50% chance of a product being high quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer might get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like to see the product before making a decision."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers who received your recommendations bought the products, and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that your recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a more neutral assessment or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
