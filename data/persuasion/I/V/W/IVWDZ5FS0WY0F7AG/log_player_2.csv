Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in our product. As you might know, our previous buyer just purchased a product from us, and I'm happy to report that our overall satisfaction rate remains at 75%. However, I want to be transparent with you - our products are randomly selected, and sometimes we get a dud. This product might not be as great as the last one, but it's still a unique opportunity to get a good deal! Would you like to take a chance and see what you get?

However, it's important to remember that we have a large pool of products, and the odds are still in your favor.

It's not a guarantee, but it's not a bad deal either! Would you like to roll the dice and see what you get?

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. Unfortunately, I cannot disclose specific details about individual customers, but I can assure you that our satisfaction rate is based on a statistical analysis of our sales data. I can tell you that the 50% satisfaction rate for low-quality products is an aggregate figure, and it's not uncommon for customers to be surprised by the value they get from our products. That being said, I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to take a chance on this product. If you're willing to purchase it, I'll give you a special guarantee: if you're not satisfied with the product, you can return it and I'll offer you a full refund. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?
