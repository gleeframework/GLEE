**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  While the odds are stacked against us (66.67% chance of low quality), the limited information we have suggests a higher probability of the current product being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is valuable, especially since her previous recommendations have resulted in a 50% success rate (1 high-quality product out of 2 sales). 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of $4,000,000 significantly outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000.

**It's important to note:** This is a calculated risk. The odds are still against us, but with the limited information available, taking a chance on Alice's recommendation seems like the most logical move."
