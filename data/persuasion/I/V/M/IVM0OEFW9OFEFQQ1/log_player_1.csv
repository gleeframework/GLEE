Unfortunately, they didn't quite grasp the value of the product I was offering, which is why they passed on it. However, I'm confident that you'll be able to see the value in this product.

However, I'd like to point out that the first high-quality product was sold to a buyer who was willing to take the risk, and the second high-quality product was sold to a buyer who asked about the quality of the product before making a decision.
