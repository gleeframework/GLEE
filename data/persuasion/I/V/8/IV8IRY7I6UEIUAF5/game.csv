,,Alice,1,You're getting a great deal! This product is a rare opportunity to own a unique item. I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to take it home for $10000?,
,,the buyer,1,"Since I have no information about the seller's previous sales record, I must rely on the product's expected value. With a 50% chance of being high quality ($40000) and a 50% chance of being low quality ($0), the expected value is $20000. However, the asking price is $10000, which is lower than the expected value. But I still don't want to take the risk with no previous sales data, so I'll pass on this one.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I know you've seen my impressive track record, but I want to be transparent with you - this product is a bit of an outlier. It's not as high-quality as my previous offerings, but I'm still confident it has some value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000, a price that reflects its unique characteristics. Would you like to take a chance on this product and potentially get a good deal?",

,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'd like to see a larger sample size of sales before making a decision. Two sales with a 100% success rate is not enough to convince me, especially considering the high stakes. I'll have to pass on this offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
