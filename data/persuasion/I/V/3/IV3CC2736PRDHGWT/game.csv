,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on your recommendation, it seems like the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm aware that the previous buyer was recommended to buy, but they didn't, and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the previous buyer might have passed on a low-quality product. Given the low probability of a high-quality product (33.33%), I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."
