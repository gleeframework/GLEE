,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to wait for a new product or more information before making a decision."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them were high-quality products, I suspect that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products.
