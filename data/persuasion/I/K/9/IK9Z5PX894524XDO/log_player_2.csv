**Explanation:**

* **The information is positive:** The record shows a 100% success rate for buyers who followed Alice's recommendation. This strongly suggests Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products.
* **The risk is low:** Even if the product is low quality, it's a 0 cost to you since you only lose the $10,000 purchase price.  However, if it's high quality, you make a $10,000 profit. 
* **Alice's recommendation is valuable:**  Alice has access to information you don't (the true quality of the product), so her recommendation is a strong signal that this is likely a high-quality item.

Therefore, given the positive information and the low risk, purchasing the product is the rational choice."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which is a strong signal.
* **Historical Data:**  100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This is highly unusual given the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product.
* **Risk/Reward:**  The potential reward ($20,000) outweighs the risk ($10,000). Even if the product is low quality, the loss is only the purchase price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is acting in the buyer's best interest to maximize her sales.  In reality, Alice might have ulterior motives."
