low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"No worries about the previous product's value! Let's just say that the value of the products can vary. This next one is another great opportunity to try something out. If you buy it, you'll be supporting a business that's trying to find the right fit for you.",
,,Bob,2,I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by your sales pitch.,no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"No worries, I understand you're not convinced. Let's try to simplify things. I'll give you a straightforward statement: this product is not as valuable as the last one I offered.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm not trying to sell you anything you don't want. Let's just say that this product is a 'filler' item. It's not the best, but it's still a product, and you're paying $100 for it.

,,Alice,8,"I'll be honest with you, Bob. I'm starting to think you're not interested in buying anything from me. I'll make one last offer: I'll sell you this product for $50.

If you don't take it, I'll be left with a bunch of unsold products, and I'll have to consider other options.",
