low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the chance of getting a high-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it, which suggests that it might be low-quality. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I think the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that Alice recommended it, but none of the previous buyers purchased the products recommended by Alice. This suggests that the products recommended by Alice may be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker and I think the potential reward is worth the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this product and see what the next one has to offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendations, I suspect that the products they saw were low-quality. Since there have been no high-quality products sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for a product that Alice recommends, which might be a high-quality one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'll wait for the next product to see if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on my own probability assessment, not Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying because I think the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high, and I don't want to let it go to waste. Can I get a better price, though?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think you've been recommending low-quality products so far, and I want to see if I can get a high-quality one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 buyers who received a recommendation to buy purchased the product, but none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'm skeptical of her recommendation and will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm basing my decision on the statistics, which show that 0 out of 6 products sold were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, as the potential reward of $12000 is significant."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 buyers have passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that the products being sold are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see the probability of a high-quality product being sold before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it? Is it because of the statistics or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think it's likely to be a low-quality product given your previous recommendations to other buyers."
