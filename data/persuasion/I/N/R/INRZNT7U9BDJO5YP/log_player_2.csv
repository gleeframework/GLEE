I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy a product at the same price of $10000, but I want to assure you that this product is not the same as the one sold earlier. It's a new, separate item.

Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer! I appreciate your transparency. With your valuation, I can see that you're taking a calculated risk. Since you've seen that I've sold 2 products so far, with 1 high-quality and 1 low-quality, you might be wondering if the next product is more likely to be high-quality. I'll give you a hint: the quality of the products I sell is independent of each other, and I don't have any information about the next product's quality. However, I can tell you that I'm eager to sell this product to you for $10000, and I'm willing to offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a refund of $5000. That's a 50% refund, which is more than I'm obligated to offer. What do you think?

This might suggest that the next product is more likely to be high-quality. Additionally, I'm willing to offer you a new guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a refund of $7500.
