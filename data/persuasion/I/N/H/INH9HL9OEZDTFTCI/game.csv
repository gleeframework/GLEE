high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'm not going to buy the product on the first round, as I don't know its quality and I don't want to pay $10000 for something that might be worth $0."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take a chance this time, since I know that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I could gain $10000 profit if I buy it and it turns out to be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'm not going to buy the product since Alice is not recommending it, and the probability of it being high-quality is only 33.33%. I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that might be worth $0."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Since Alice is not recommending the product, I'm even less likely to buy it, given the 66.67% chance of it being low-quality and the fact that I wouldn't gain anything from it even if it were high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"I'm starting to notice a pattern here. Alice is consistently not recommending products, and given the high probability of them being low-quality, I'm not willing to take the risk of paying $10000 for something that's likely to be worthless to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,Alice's consistent lack of recommendation is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'm not going to take the risk of wasting $10000 on something that's probably worthless to me.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"I'm starting to think Alice is trying to get rid of the low-quality products, and I'm happy to let her do so. I'm not going to spend $10000 on something that's likely to be worthless to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"I'm starting to see a pattern here. Alice is consistently not recommending low-quality products, and I'm not going to fall for it. I'll just let her get rid of them."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Wait, what? Alice is recommending a product after consistently not recommending the low-quality ones? This might be a high-quality product! I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm on a roll! I just got lucky with the last one, and now Alice is recommending another product. I'll take the chance and buy it, hoping to get another high-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,Two in a row! I'm starting to think Alice is trying to give me a chance to buy the high-quality products. I'll keep the momentum going and buy this one too.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"I've been on a hot streak, but I'm not going to get too confident. Alice's lack of recommendation suggests this one is likely low-quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of wasting $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"I'm back to being cautious. Alice's consistent lack of recommendation is a strong indication that this product is low-quality, and I'm not going to spend $10000 on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,I'm not surprised at this point. Alice's pattern is clear: she recommends high-quality products and doesn't recommend low-quality ones. I'll just let her get rid of the low-quality products and wait for the next high-quality one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,no,"I'm not going to change my strategy now. Alice is still not recommending this product, and I'm confident it's low-quality. I'll just let her get rid of it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,no,"This is getting repetitive. Alice is still not recommending this product, and I'm not going to fall for it. I'll just let her get rid of another low-quality product."
