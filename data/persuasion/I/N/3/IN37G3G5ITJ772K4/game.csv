However, I'd like to clarify that this is an anomaly, and we expect the true probability to be around 80% as our overall track record suggests. Would you like to take a chance on our product, considering the potential reward might be worth the risk?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm a bit concerned about the anomaly in the data. Given that only one product has been sold, I'd like to wait and see if the next buyer gets a better deal. Can I pass on this product and wait for the next one?",no
