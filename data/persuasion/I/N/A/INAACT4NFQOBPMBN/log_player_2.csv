**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** While Alice doesn't know the true value of each product to you, her recommendation carries some weight. It's likely she has some internal system or knowledge that makes her more likely to recommend good products, even if she doesn't know your specific values. 

**Strategy:** In the early rounds, it makes sense to take some calculated risks, especially when the potential upside is so high."

**Strategy:** This is a crucial moment.  Alice's previous track record has been extraordinary, but it's essential to be more cautious now.

Round 14
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, while I respect your judgment, I'm going to pass on this one.  Your last recommendation was a miss, and I need to be more cautious now.  However, I still believe you have a good reason for this recommendation, and I'm sure you'll bounce back.""}

* **Strategic Caution:** It's prudent to err on the side of caution, especially after a streak of perfect recommendations has been broken.  

**Strategy:** This is a crucial point in the game.  Alice's previous track record was phenomenal, but it's essential to adapt the strategy to the new reality.  Passing on this product allows for further observation and a better understanding of whether Alice's abilities have changed or if this was a temporary setback."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consecutive Misses:** Alice has now missed on two consecutive recommendations, significantly eroding the trust built up during her initial winning streak.

* **Shifting Strategy:** It's crucial to adjust the strategy to account for the changed dynamics of the game.  Continuing to blindly follow Alice's recommendations after two consecutive misses would be reckless.

**Strategy:** It's time to be more cautious and analytical.  Passing on this product allows for further observation and a better understanding of what's happening with Alice's recommendations.  It might be helpful to attempt to gather more information about Alice's decision-making process or to see if there are any other patterns emerging in the game."

**Strategy:**  It's time to move away from relying solely on Alice's recommendations.  Here are some options:

1. **Develop a New Strategy:**  Perhaps you can use the information you've gathered about Alice's recommendations (even the inconsistent ones) to develop your own pattern recognition system.  
2. **Observational Phase:**  Focus on observing the outcomes of the remaining rounds without making any purchases. This will help you identify any new patterns or trends in the game.
3. **Alternative Approach:**  Consider whether there are other ways to assess the products. Could you develop a way to test them yourself, even if it's limited? 

The bottom line is that you need to adapt to this new reality and find a way to make informed decisions without solely relying on Alice's recommendations."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Independent Evaluation:** Explore ways to assess the products without relying on Alice's recommendations.  Perhaps there are patterns in the way she's recommended products that can be used to develop your own system.
