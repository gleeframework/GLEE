,,Alice,3,"I see you're being cautious, and I respect that. I'll give you a bit more information about this product.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I respect your decision, and I understand that you're not willing to compromise on the price. I'll try a different approach. I'm willing to offer you a 'test drive' of the product. You can use it for a trial period, and if you decide you want to keep it, we can discuss the price at the end of the trial. This way, you can see the value of the product firsthand and make an informed decision. I'm still offering it to you for $1000000, but the trial period will give you a chance to experience it before committing to the purchase.",

I'll sell this product to you for $100000, and I'll throw in a guarantee that if you're not completely satisfied with it, I'll take it back and give you a full refund.
