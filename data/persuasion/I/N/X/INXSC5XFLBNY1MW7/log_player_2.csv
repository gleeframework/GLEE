"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I know it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can finalize the sale.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take it, but I'm only buying it because I have no information about the product's quality. I'm expecting to get a high-quality product, which is worth $12,500 to me.""
}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you liked the previous product! Since you're aware that the first product was high-quality, I'll give you a special offer. If you buy this product, I'll throw in a free inspection report that will reveal the quality of this product. If it's high-quality, you'll get the same great deal as before. If it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, and you can walk away with no loss. The price remains the same at $10000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the special offer. I already know that the first product was high-quality, but that doesn't give me any information about the quality of this new product. I'll just take my chances and pass on this offer.""

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, but I'd like to offer you a different approach. Since you've already passed on the previous offer, I'll give you a simple binary choice: buy the product for $10000, or I'll reveal the quality of the product to you for free, and you can decide whether to buy it at the same price. No strings attached. What's it going to be?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you took me up on the offer last round. Now, I'll reveal the quality of this product to you: it's a low-quality product. I know you're not interested in buying it, but I want to make you a deal. If you buy this low-quality product for $10000, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at a discounted price of $8000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to make it because I want to make things right after the last product. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your position, and I respect your decision. Since you've seen the low-quality product, I'll give you a more transparent offer this time. Given the quality of the previous product was revealed to you, and this product is indeed high-quality, I'll give you a chance to buy it at a price that reflects its true value. I'll sell it to you for $11000, which is a 10% discount from its true value. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to make it because I want to demonstrate the quality of my products. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take the product at the discounted price of $11,000. I know it's worth $12,500 to me, so I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to pay the premium for the assurance that it's a high-quality product.""

Round 6
Alice's message: I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! Now, regarding this new product, I want to be upfront with you. Given the previous product's quality was revealed to you, and you're aware of the probability of a product being high-quality (80%), I'll make a bold statement: I'm willing to sell you this product for $8000. I know it's a low-quality product, and I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm willing to take a loss on this sale because I value our relationship and want to demonstrate my commitment to transparency. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not expecting you to pay full price for a low-quality product. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not going to fall for this. You're offering me a low-quality product for $8000, which is actually below its expected value. I'm not going to pay for something that's not worth anything to me. I'll pass on this offer.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision. Since you've seen the previous low-quality product and the discounted offer, I'll make a new approach. I'll give you a simple question: would you like to buy the product for $10000, or would you like to play a game where you can potentially get a better deal? If you choose the game, I'll sell you the product for $10000, but with a chance to negotiate the price down to $9000 if you can correctly guess whether the next product (which I'll reveal to you after this purchase) is high-quality or low-quality. What's your choice?

The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: Congratulations on playing the game! You've purchased a high-quality product, and now it's time to play the game again. Since you've already bought the high-quality product, I'll give you a hint about the next product: it's the opposite of the previous one. Given that you know the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'll ask you to guess whether this product is high-quality or low-quality. If you correctly guess, I'll sell it to you for $9000. If you incorrectly guess, the price will be $10000. What's your guess?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",

Round 9
Alice's message: You correctly guessed the quality of the previous product! As promised, I'll sell it to you for $9000. Now, regarding this new product, I'll give you a straightforward offer. Given that you've seen two products in a row that are not representative of the 80% probability of high-quality products, I'll offer you a'rebalancing' deal. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $11500, which is a slight premium above the expected value. I want to make up for the previous two products not meeting your expectations. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

I'll sell you this low-quality product for $4000, which is 20% of the expected value of a high-quality product. It's a significant discount, and I'm willing to make it because I want to demonstrate that I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial deal. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
