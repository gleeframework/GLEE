  ""message"": ""I'm glad you liked the previous product! Since you're aware that the first product was high-quality, I'll give you a special offer. If you buy this product, I'll throw in a free inspection report that will reveal the quality of this product. If it's high-quality, you'll get the same great deal as before. If it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, and you can walk away with no loss. The price remains the same at $10,000. What do you say?""

No strings attached. What's it going to be?""

If you buy this low-quality product for $10,000, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at a discounted price of $8,000.

Given the previous product's quality was revealed to you, and you're aware of the probability of a product being high-quality (80%), I'll make a bold statement: I'm willing to sell you this product for $8,000. I know it's a low-quality product, and I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm willing to take a loss on this sale because I value our relationship and want to demonstrate my commitment to transparency. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not expecting you to pay full price for a low-quality product. What do you say?""
}"

  ""message"": ""I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision. Since you've seen the previous low-quality product and the discounted offer, I'll make a new approach. I'll give you a simple question: would you like to buy the product for $10,000, or would you like to play a game where you can potentially get a better deal? If you choose the game, I'll sell you the product for $10,000, but with a chance to negotiate the price down to $9,000 if you can correctly guess whether the next product (which I'll reveal to you after this purchase) is high-quality or low-quality.
