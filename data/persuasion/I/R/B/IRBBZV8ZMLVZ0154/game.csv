,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm offering you a chance to buy it at this price, but I want to assure you that I'm not desperate to sell it. In fact, I'm only offering it to you because I think you might appreciate its value.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, I'm glad you're willing to sell it to me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! However, I want to be upfront with you that this next product is not as good as the first one. It's still a great value, but it's not as high-quality as the one you just bought. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100, but I want to give you a chance to reconsider based on this information.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not sure I want to take the risk on a product that's not as good as the first one. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns in the previous round, but I want to assure you that this product is of the same high quality as the first one you purchased. In fact, it's a unique item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100, but I want to give you a special offer: if you buy this product, I'll throw in a complementary service that's worth at least $20. This way, you'll be getting an even better deal than before.",

high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you liked the previous offer! However, I want to let you know that I've changed my mind about the complementary service. Instead, I'll give you a special discount on this product. I'll sell it to you for $90, which is $10 less than the original price. I think this is a fair price for a high-quality product like this one.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, but I'm not sure I want to pay $90 for a product that's already worth $300 to me. I'll pass on this one.",yes

I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that's lower than the original $100, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'll sell it to you for $80, and I'll throw in a guarantee: if you're not satisfied with the product, you can return it to me and I'll give you a full refund.",

,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! However, I want to let you know that this product is not as rare as the last one, and it's not as valuable to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $80, but I'm not offering any guarantees this time. I think it's a good opportunity for you to get a product at a low price, but I want to be upfront with you about its quality.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your honesty, but after the last product turned out to be low-quality, I'm not willing to take the risk on another one at $80.",no

If you're not completely satisfied with the product, you can return it to me within 30 days and get a full refund.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not convinced that this product is worth the $100 price tag, especially after the last low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.",no
