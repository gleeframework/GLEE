,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous buyer was able to purchase a low-quality product, and Alice's recommendation may be biased towards encouraging me to buy a low-quality product as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00% and I'm willing to take that risk."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust Alice's recommendation based on her past performance. Given the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to be cautious and pass on the product."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, given that none of the previous buyers were able to get a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I would like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first three, the probability that the product is high quality is still 80.00%. However, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold is not enough to update the probability of the product being high quality. I'll pass on it to get more information about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought suggests that they were all low-quality products, which would mean that the proportion of high-quality products is higher than the 80% in the population, or that Alice is trying to manipulate the information. I'd like to get more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the previous 3 buyers all purchased the products recommended by you, and none of them were high quality. This suggests that your recommendations may not be reliable indicators of the product's quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a more neutral recommendation."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I would like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
