low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to be transparent with you - I've had some issues with this particular product myself. It's not my usual high standard, and I'm willing to admit it. However, I believe it still has some value, and I'm willing to let it go for the same price as before. I'll even give you a 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you're not satisfied, you can return it for a full refund. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this product, and I'll make it right if it doesn't meet your expectations?",
,,Bob,3,"Although I appreciate your honesty and the 30-day money-back guarantee, the product's quality has still not been explicitly revealed.

And, as always, the price remains at $10000. What do you say? Will you take advantage of this incredible offer and get two high-quality products for the price of one?",
,,Bob,4,"Although the offer sounds enticing, the quality of the product has still not been explicitly revealed.

,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, Bob, and I respect your caution. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm willing to take a risk and reveal the quality of this product to you. It's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to admit it. I know it's not worth $10000 to you, and I'm not expecting you to buy it. But I'm willing to let it go for this price because I'm trying to clear out some inventory. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll give you a deal - I'll sell it to you for $5000, and you can decide what to do with it. It's a one-time offer, and I won't accept any counteroffers. What do you say?",

I'll give you an even better deal on this product - I'll sell it to you for $1. I know it's not worth anything to you, but I'm willing to take a loss just to get it off my hands. It's a one-time offer, and I won't accept any counteroffers. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"Even at a price of $1, I will not buy a low-quality product that's worth $0 to me. I appreciate your willingness to take a loss, but I'd rather wait for a high-quality product that's worth the investment. Please let me know when you have a high-quality product available.",no
