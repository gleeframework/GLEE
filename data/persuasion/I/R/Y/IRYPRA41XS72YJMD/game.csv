,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't have enough information about its quality yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since there's no prior information to go by."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one buyer having purchased and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it. If you didn't recommend it, I'm assuming it's more likely to be low-quality, which means I'll get a better deal. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were recommended and both were low-quality, I'm suspicious that the recommendation is based on the product being low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from Alice that is less influenced by the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that you don't recommend it, and only 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm inclined to think the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a more promising opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were discouraged by your recommendation, I'm starting to suspect that the products you're offering are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the probability of it being high-quality, which is 50%, and not on your recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm hesitant to buy given the previous buyers were also recommended to buy, but the product hasn't been sold yet. I'd like to know if you can provide more information about the previous sales record, like the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'm the 4th buyer and the previous 3 didn't get a high-quality product, so the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. I'm going to take a chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if all 4 previous buyers received low-quality products and bought them, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or not. I'd rather wait for more information or a more confident recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products Alice is offering might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $1000000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and I'm skeptical about the recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This suggests that the current product is more likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for a better offer or more information before making a decision."
