,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000, a 16.7% discount from its true value. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal, and I'll be happy to provide you with a certificate of authenticity. What do you say?",

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're satisfied with your purchase. This next product is also a high-quality item, and I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000. However, I'd like to assure you that I've taken extra precautions to ensure its quality, and it's been thoroughly inspected. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure I believe you about the extra precautions. The price is the same as last time, and I'm not getting any additional information that would make me think this product is more valuable than the one I already bought. I'll pass for now.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your diligence. Let me offer you a different approach. I'll give you a detailed report on the product's specifications, including its serial number, certification, and any relevant documentation. This way, you can verify its authenticity and value independently. The price remains $10000, but I'm confident that with this information, you'll see the value it brings.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that the documentation will change my decision. The price is still the same as before, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that I think is worth $12000. I'd need a lower price to consider buying it.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about the price. I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll offer you a price of $11500 for this high-quality product.

If you're interested, I'll also include a 5-year warranty, which is not typically included with products at this price point. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm still not interested in paying more than $10000. I think the product is worth $12000 to me, and I'm not willing to pay a premium for a warranty that I might not need. I'll pass on this offer.",no

,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the previous purchase. This next product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to offer you the same risk-free trial. However, I'd like to propose a slight change: if you're not satisfied with this product, I'll not only give you a full refund but also offer you a second product of your choice from my inventory, up to a value of $5000. This way, you'll have the opportunity to try another product, and I'll take on the risk of providing you with a product that meets your expectations. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm intrigued by the offer, but I'm still not convinced that I want to buy another product without knowing its quality.
