**Reasoning:**

Even though the odds are stacked against you (66.67% chance of low quality), the fact that Alice recommended the product is a significant signal. 

Here's why:

* **Alice knows the true value:**  She knows the actual quality of the product.
* **Alice has an incentive to sell:**  She makes money from sales, so she's not going to recommend a product she knows is worthless to you. 
* **Past sales record:**  The fact that one high-quality product was sold out of one sale is a strong indicator that Alice has a good track record. 

While there's still a risk, the potential reward of a $12,500 product outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."
