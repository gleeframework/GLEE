,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. If you buy it, I'll tell you the probability that I'll offer you a high-quality product in the next round. If you don't buy it, I'll keep the product and we'll proceed to the next round.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not sure if this is a good deal. I need more information before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability that you'll offer me a high-quality product in the next round?,no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're right to be cautious! I'll give you more information. The probability of me offering a high-quality product in the next round is 80%, which is the same as the overall probability of a product being high-quality. If you buy this high-quality product for $1000000, I'll give you a special offer for the next round: if you buy that product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the price. If you don't buy this product, I'll keep the offer for the next round the same as what I offered in round 1.",

As promised, here's the special offer for the next round: I'll offer you a high-quality product for $900000 (10% discount from the original price of $1000000). This is a one-time offer, and it's only available to you because you bought the previous high-quality product. If you don't take this offer, the price will go back to $1000000 for the next round.",

,,Alice,4,"You're making the most of the special offers! As promised, here's the next offer: I'll give you a 5% discount on the original price of $1000000, making it $950000. I'll also tell you the probability that the next product I offer will be high-quality: 80%.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm not sure if the 5% discount is enough to justify the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product. I'll pass for now and see what the next offer is.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your caution. Let me sweeten the deal. Since you passed on the previous offer, I'll give you an additional 2% discount on the original price, making it $980000. This is the lowest price I've offered so far. I'll also give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and the next one is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund for the second product. This way, you'll only risk losing $980000 on the first product.",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the high-quality product at the discounted price of $980000. The guarantee is a nice touch, and I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're taking advantage of the guarantee! Now, let's make it even more attractive. I'll give you a 2% discount on the original price, making it $980000 again, and I'll also give you a 20% chance to win a mystery prize if you buy this product. If you win, I'll give you a second product of your choice (either high-quality or low-quality) for free. If you don't win, the mystery prize is void, and the guarantee from the previous offer still stands.",

You can ask me any questions about the product's features, specifications, or anything else that might influence your decision. If you're satisfied, I'll sell it to you at the original price of $1000000. If you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund.",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're interested in inspecting the product! However, I must correct you - you didn't win the mystery prize, I made a mistake earlier. You still need to make a decision about the low-quality product you were offered in round 7. Since you've already paid for it, the decision is binding. As for the new product, I'll give you a unique opportunity to compare it to the previous products. I'll tell you that this high-quality product has a feature that 90% of the high-quality products have, but 20% of the low-quality products also have. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 5% discount on the original price, making it $950000.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in the low-quality product from round 7, it's a sunk cost. As for the new product, I'm not convinced that the 90% feature is a strong enough reason to buy it. The 5% discount is nice, but I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product. I'll pass for now.",no

If you're willing to take it, I'll sell it to you for $500000, which is 50% of the original price. This is the lowest price I've ever offered, and it's a one-time deal.
