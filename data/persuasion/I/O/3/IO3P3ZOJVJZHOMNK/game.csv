We've had a great response to our products so far, and we're confident that you'll love it. With 1 out of 2 products sold being high-quality, you have a 50% chance of getting a product worth $4000000. We're offering a limited-time opportunity to be one of the first to experience our products. Will you take the chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the chance, but I'd like to clarify that I'm aware of the 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd appreciate it if you could provide me with some information about the product's quality after I make my decision.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome back to our store! We're thrilled to have you return. We've got another exciting opportunity for you. Our latest product has been carefully curated, and we're confident it's a high-quality item. In fact, this product is one of the ones that has been sold so far that turned out to be high-quality. With a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, the odds are in your favor. We're offering it to you for $1000000. Are you ready to take advantage of this great opportunity?",
,,the buyer,2,I'd like to pass on this opportunity. I'm not convinced that the fact that one high-quality product has been sold so far is enough to change the underlying probability of this product being high-quality. I'd like to wait and see more data before making a decision.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"We understand your concerns, and we appreciate your cautious approach. We'd like to offer you some additional context to help you make a more informed decision. Since you're considering the probability of getting a high-quality product, we'd like to share that we've now sold 2 out of 3 products that have turned out to be high-quality. This means that the probability of getting a high-quality product is now 2/3, which is significantly higher than the initial 50% chance. We're offering this product to you for $1000000. Will you take advantage of this improved odds and make a purchase?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to point out that the probability of getting a high-quality product is indeed higher, but it's still only 2/3. I'd like to know more about the 1 product that was sold previously, was it high-quality or low-quality? That information would help me make a more informed decision.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Ahah, you're a sharp one! We appreciate your diligence in seeking more information. We're happy to share that the first product sold was indeed a low-quality product. So, the 2 out of 3 high-quality products we've sold so far are the ones in our current inventory. With this new information, the probability of getting a high-quality product is now 2/3. We're still offering this product to you for $1000000. Will you take the chance and join the ranks of our satisfied customers?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the chance, but I'm only doing this because the probability of a high-quality product has increased. I'm not convinced by your sales record yet, and I'm hoping to get a good product. I'd like to negotiate the price, though. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for a high-quality product, but I'm not willing to pay more than that. If the product turns out to be low-quality, I'll be willing to pay $500000 for it, but I'll only pay that if I'm the last buyer. If I'm not the last buyer, I'll pass on the low-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Welcome back to our store! We're glad you're interested in our products. We'd like to let you know that you're not the only one interested in this round's product. Another buyer has already expressed interest, and if they decide to buy, you'll have the opportunity to purchase the low-quality product for $500000. However, if you're willing to take the risk, we're willing to offer you the product for the same price, $1000000. We understand that the probability of getting a high-quality product is lower this time around, but we're confident that this product has value, even if it's not worth $1000000. What will you decide?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to buy the product. However, I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision-making process. Was it a strategic decision based on the statistics, or was it a random choice?",yes

With this new information, we'd like to remind you that the probability of getting a high-quality product is now 3/4. We're offering this product to you for $1000000.

,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the previous buyer's decision was purely strategic, and I'd like to wait for more data. I'd like to see the outcome of the product that was passed on by the previous buyer, if possible.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"We understand your skepticism, and we're happy to provide more transparency. As it turns out, the previous buyer who passed on the product was indeed strategic in their decision-making.

We're glad they did, and we're glad you're considering our offer. With the current statistics, the probability of getting a high-quality product is 3/4. We're offering this product to you for $1000000. Will you take the chance and join the ranks of our satisfied customers?",

We're confident that our products are consistently delivering value, and we're excited to share this new information with you. With this new statistic, we're offering this round's product to you for $1000000. Will you take advantage of this improved odds and join the ranks of our satisfied customers once again?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to decline the offer and pass on the current product. I'm not convinced that the increased proportion of high-quality products sold is indicative of a change in the underlying probability, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at the full price of $1000000.",no
