**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** While the data is limited (only 3 previous buyers), it shows that Alice is at least somewhat accurate with her recommendations. 
* **Potential Gain:** Even with a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, the potential gain of $12,500 outweighs the potential loss of $10,000. 
* **Risk Tolerance:** This game suggests a risk-taking attitude, as the potential reward is significant.

**Important Note:** This is a simplified scenario. In a real-world situation, the decision would be much more complex and would consider factors like the cost of the product, the buyer's financial situation, and the level of trust in the seller."

**Explanation:**

The buyer should buy the product. Here's why:

* **Strong Evidence:**  While the overall chance of a product being high quality is 50%, the seller's recommendations have resulted in a significantly higher proportion of high-quality products being sold (3/7 = 42.86%). This suggests the seller has some ability to discern high-quality products.
* **Value of Information:**  Alice's recommendation carries weight, as it signals her belief that this particular product is likely high-quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($12,500) far outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0).  

Therefore, it makes logical sense to trust Alice's recommendation and buy the product."
