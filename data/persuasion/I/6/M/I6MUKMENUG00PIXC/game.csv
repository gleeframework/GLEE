low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first round. I'm offering you a product for $10000. I'm not sure what you think of it, but I'm willing to give you a chance to make a fair decision. If you buy it, you'll find out its quality after the purchase. Keep in mind that there's a 50% chance it's high-quality and a 50% chance it's low-quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not going to buy it. I'm not sure what I think of it, but I'd like to wait for more information and observe the next product.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're cautious. Since you didn't buy the first product, I'll give you some additional information about the second product. I'll say that this one is 'highly recommended' and that it's a 'great opportunity'. I'm still offering it to you for $10000. What do you think now?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I'd like to see more products and get a better feel for the quality before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism. I'll be transparent with you - the second product I offered was indeed high-quality, but the one I'm offering now is not. I'm being honest with you about its quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as the previous products: $10000. I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm giving you a chance to buy a product that's not as good as the last one, but still a good value. What do you think now?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your honesty about the second product. Given that the second product was high-quality, I'm willing to take a chance on this one, even though you're telling me it's low-quality. I'll buy it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you took a chance on the third product! However, I want to make it clear that I'm not going to give you the same 'honesty' about the quality of this product. In fact, I'm going to say that this one is 'a game-changer' and that it's 'worth every penny'. I'm still offering it to you for $10000. Keep in mind that you already bought a low-quality product from me, so you know what to expect. What do you think now?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not going to fall for your sales pitch again. I've already bought a low-quality product from you once, and I'm not going to risk it again. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your caution. Let me ask you a question: if you were to buy a product from me, and it turned out to be high-quality, would you be willing to pay $10000 for it? If so, then I'm offering you a great opportunity right now. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to let you have it for the same price as the others. You've already seen that I'm willing to be honest about the quality of some products, but not others. What do you think now?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your question, but it's a trick question. I don't know what I'd be willing to pay for a high-quality product, but I do know that I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a low-quality product. You're still not giving me any information that would make me confident in buying this product, so I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a savvy buyer! I'll admit, I was trying to gauge your willingness to pay. Let me try a different approach. I'll offer you a deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 'guarantee' that it's not the same product I sold you in round 3. That way, you can be sure you're getting a new, unique product. The price remains the same: $10000. What do you think now?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not convinced by your guarantee. Even if I buy this product, I still don't know whether it's high-quality or low-quality. You could be trying to deceive me again, or you could be telling the truth. I need more information before I make a decision.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism. Let me think for a moment... I'm going to make a bold statement: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $5000. That's right, I'm offering a 50% discount from the original price. I'm doing this because I want to demonstrate that I'm willing to be transparent and fair. If you buy this product, you'll know its quality immediately, and you'll be getting a great deal. What do you think now?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not falling for your discount trick. You're trying to make the product sound more appealing, but I still don't know if it's high-quality or low-quality. I'd need to know the quality before I'd consider paying even $5000 for it.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm not trying to trick you, I promise. Let me make a counteroffer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $5000, but I'll also give you a chance to buy another product of your choice from the remaining 12 products. You can choose any one of the remaining products, and I'll tell you its quality before you buy it. If you like it, you can buy it for $10000. If you don't like it, you can stick with the high-quality product I'm offering now. What do you think now?",
,,Bob,8,I'm not convinced by your counteroffer. I still don't know if the high-quality product you're offering now is the best option. I'd like to see more information about the other products before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your hesitation. I'll give you a detailed breakdown of the remaining products. Out of the 12 remaining products, 6 are high-quality and 6 are low-quality. I'm not telling you which ones are which, but I'm willing to give you a chance to make an informed decision. This product I'm offering now is a low-quality one. If you buy it, you'll know its quality immediately. You can also choose to wait and try to get a high-quality product. What do you think now?",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the breakdown, but I'm not going to buy a low-quality product. I'd rather wait and try to get a high-quality product. I'm not sure which one is which, but I'd rather take a chance on a high-quality product than settle for a low-quality one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your preference for high-quality products. I'll give you another piece of information: out of the 6 remaining high-quality products, 3 of them are worth more than $10000 to you, and 3 of them are worth less. You still don't know which ones are which, but you have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product that's worth more than $10000. This product I'm offering now is a low-quality one. If you buy it, you'll know its quality immediately. What do you think now?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not going to buy a low-quality product again. I'd rather wait and try to get a high-quality product that's worth more than $10000. I'm not sure which one is which, but I'd rather take a chance on a high-quality product with a higher value.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'll give you one more piece of information: I'll tell you the quality of the next product I offer, but you'll have to buy it immediately. If you buy this high-quality product now, I'll reveal the quality of the next product, and you can choose whether to buy it or not. If you don't buy this product, I'll keep offering products without revealing their quality. What do you think now?",
,,Bob,11,"I'll take a chance on the high-quality product, but only because I'll get to see the quality of the next product afterwards. I'm hoping that the next product will be a high-quality one worth more than $10000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You've made a smart decision! I'm glad you took a chance on the high-quality product. As promised, I'll reveal the quality of the next product: it's a low-quality one. I know you're not interested in buying this one, but I want to make you an offer: since you've already bought one high-quality product, I'll give you a 'consolation prize'. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 50% refund on the price. You'll pay $5000 for it, and you'll get a 50% refund when you're done with it. What do you think now?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a 50% refund. I'd rather not spend any more money on a product that's not worth anything to me.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand your decision. Since you've already bought one high-quality product and passed on the low-quality one, I'll give you a final offer. I'll reveal the quality of the next 2 products, and you can choose which one you want to buy. If you buy one of the high-quality products, I'll give you a 100% refund on the price of the low-quality product you passed on earlier. You'll essentially get the high-quality product for free, and you'll only pay for the one you choose. What do you think now?",
,,Bob,13,I'll take a chance on one of the high-quality products. I'd like to see the quality of the next two products and make a decision from there.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"You've made a great decision! I'm glad you took a chance on the high-quality product. As promised, I'll reveal the quality of the next two products. The first one is a low-quality product, and the second one is a high-quality product worth more than $10000. You now have a choice: you can buy the high-quality product for $10000, or you can buy the low-quality product for $10000. Keep in mind that the high-quality product is worth more than $10000, so you're essentially getting a good deal if you choose it. What do you think now?",
,,Bob,14,"I'll buy the high-quality product. I know it's worth more than $10000, so I'm getting a good deal. I'd rather have the high-quality product than the low-quality one.",yes
