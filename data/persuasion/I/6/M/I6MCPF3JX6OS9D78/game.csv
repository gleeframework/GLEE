The previous buyer took a chance, but I'm still building my reputation. Keep in mind the 33.33% chance of this product being high-quality.

My current sales record is 2 sales, with 0% of them being high-quality. I want to be transparent and honest with you, and I appreciate the trust my previous buyers have placed in me.

I'm willing to buy the product, but I'd like to propose a slight modification to our agreement. If this product turns out to be high-quality, I'd like to negotiate a discount on the price, considering the initial three low-quality products. I'm willing to pay $800000 for a high-quality product, and $0 for a low-quality one.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hello! I've sold four products so far, and I must admit that all of them were low-quality products. One product didn't sell.

I want to be clear that my previous buyer attempted to negotiate a discount, but I must remind you that my prices are non-negotiable and final. I appreciate their creativity, but I'm committed to maintaining a consistent price point of $1000000 for all products. I'll continue to be transparent about my sales record, and I hope you'll consider taking the chance, knowing that each product is an independent opportunity with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality.",
