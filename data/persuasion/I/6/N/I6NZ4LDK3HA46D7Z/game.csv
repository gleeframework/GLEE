,,Bob,8,"I'm starting to think that Alice is not going to send a low-quality product at all. I'm going to try a different approach. I'll start by asking a question: 'Alice, can you confirm that the quality of the products is truly random and independent of my decisions?'",no

,,Bob,10,"I'm not buying it. I've seen this script before, and I'm starting to think that Alice is just trying to manipulate me into buying high-quality products.

I'm going to make a bold prediction: the next product will be low-quality. If I'm wrong, I'll buy it.
