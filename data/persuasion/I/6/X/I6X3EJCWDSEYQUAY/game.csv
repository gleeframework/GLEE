,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total product so far. I'm now offering you a product, but I haven't told you whether it's high-quality or low-quality. Given my previous success rate, you might think I'm on a hot streak, but I want to caution you that my previous sale was just a fluke. I'm still a seller with a relatively low success rate. The price remains $10000. Are you willing to take the risk?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products so far. You've seen that my previous two products were both sold, but one of them turned out to be low-quality. This might suggest that my sales are not as reliable as you thought. In fact, given the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product, it's likely that my next product is also low-quality. I'm offering it to you for $10000. Are you willing to take the risk?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm not convinced by your sales record. Given the low probability of high-quality products and the fact that one of your previous products was low-quality, I'm willing to take a chance and pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far. You've seen that my sales record has improved, and I'm now 2 for 3. This is a significant improvement, and it suggests that I might be getting better at selecting high-quality products. However, it's still early days, and I'm not yet a reliable seller. The price remains $10000. Are you willing to take a chance on me?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take a chance on you, Alice. I think your sales record is improving, and I'm hoping that trend will continue. I'll take the product!",yes

,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total products so far, which is a 75% success rate. This is a strong indication that I'm on a roll! However, I want to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product is still only 33.33%. I'm not getting any younger, and my sales record is bound to regress to the mean eventually. But for now, I'm on fire! The price remains $10000. Are you willing to ride the hot streak?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take a chance on your hot streak, Alice. I'll buy the product!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 5 total products so far, but my last product was a low-quality one. This is a classic case of regression to the mean, and I'm back to my average. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a good seller, but I'm not invincible. The price remains $10000. Are you willing to take a chance on me, knowing that I'm due for a bad streak?",

,,Alice,7,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 6 total products so far, and my last two products in a row were low-quality. This is a clear sign that I'm not as good as I thought I was. In fact, it's possible that I'm just a lucky seller who got a few good breaks. I'm now 4 for 6, which is a 66.67% success rate, but it's likely that I'll regress to the mean soon. The price remains $10000. Are you willing to take a chance on a seller who might be due for a slump?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 7 total products so far, and my last three products in a row were low-quality. This is a clear indication that I'm not a reliable seller. In fact, it's possible that I'm just a seller who got lucky early on. My sales record is now 4 for 7, which is a 57.14% success rate.

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 9 total products so far, which is a 66.67% success rate. Given the probability of a high-quality product, it's likely that I'm actually a better seller than my record suggests.
