Alice's message: I understand your curiosity about the previous buyer's negotiation strategy! I can share that they were able to successfully negotiate a deal by proposing a 'break-even' offer, where they would pay the full price if the product was high-quality, and a lower price if it was low-quality. This approach allowed them to mitigate their risk and still get a good deal.
