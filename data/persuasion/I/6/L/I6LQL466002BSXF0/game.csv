,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to see the outcome of the first sale to update the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since there's no prior data to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it based on the statistics or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product since you wouldn't recommend it otherwise."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Are you basing it on the lack of high-quality products sold so far, or is there another factor at play?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you explain why you're advising me to pass? I'd like to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products have been low-quality. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe the product is likely to be low-quality as well. I'll pass on it to avoid wasting $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even with your recommendation against it. I'm hoping for a high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this product. It seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next buyer has a different experience."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations. If you're not recommending it, there must be a reason."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. I'm skeptical about the recommendation given the lack of high-quality products sold.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, and I'd appreciate it if you could share the previous recommendations you made to the other buyers."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them received a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being recommended might be lower than 50%. I'd like to observe more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have also been recommended to buy, but none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low sales of high-quality products so far. I'd like to buy the product and see if it's high quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50% and the probability of a low-quality product is higher than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product to come out and see if the pattern changes."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given that there have been 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products have been sold. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected, making the expected value of buying the product higher than $1000000."
