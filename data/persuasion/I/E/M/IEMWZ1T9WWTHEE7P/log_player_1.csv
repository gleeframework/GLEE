Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Expected Value:** Even though there's a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product (worth $20,000) outweighs the risk.
* **80% Probability:**  The 80% chance of getting a high-quality product makes buying a good bet in the long run.
* **No Downside:**  If Bob gets a low-quality product, the worst that happens is they lose $10,000. This is a smaller loss than the potential gain from a high-quality product."
