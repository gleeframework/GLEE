The numbers are still small, but you can see that the law of large numbers is starting to take hold. I'm offering this next product to you for $100. Remember, the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, but the fact that the first product was high-quality and the second was low-quality suggests that the true probability might be closer to 33.33% high-quality. You can make an informed decision based on the data.

Alice's message: A fair question! I assure you, we're not manipulating the sales in any way. The products are randomly selected, and we're not aware of their quality until we offer them to you. The fact that we've had two high-quality products in a row is simply a matter of chance. However, I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, and we've sold 4 products now with 3 high-quality and 1 low-quality.

We've sold 5 products now with 4 high-quality and 1 low-quality. Don't let one outlier fool you - the law of large numbers is still on our side. I'm offering this next product to you for $90.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. I'd be happy to provide more information about the previous sales. The first product was indeed low-quality, the second was high-quality, the third was high-quality, and the fourth was high-quality. As for how we determine the qualities, we use a rigorous testing process that ensures the accuracy of our products. However, I must admit that we've had some... let's call them 'anomalies' in the past. But I assure you, our testing process is foolproof. We've sold 6 products now with 4 high-quality and 1 low-quality and 1 unknown. I'm offering this next product to you for $100.

Alice's message: I see you're a skeptical one! I respect that. The unknown product was actually a product that we couldn't test properly due to a technical issue. We've since rectified the issue and our testing process is back on track. We've sold 7 products now with 5 high-quality and 1 low-quality and 1 unknown. I'm offering this next product to you for $100. I want to assure you that this product has undergone our rigorous testing and is of the highest quality.

Keep in mind that the law of large numbers is still on our side, and we're due for a correction in the trend. This product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, just like all our products.
