"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Value:**  The buyer knows there's an 80% chance the product is high-quality, which is worth $4,000,000. 
* **Low Risk:**  Even if the product is low-quality (20% chance), the buyer loses only $1,000,000 (the price). 
* **Potential Gain:**  The potential gain ($3,000,000) far outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000). 

Therefore, it's logically sound to recommend the buyer to purchase the product."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **No New Information:** The buyer has no knowledge of the current product's quality, and the previous transaction doesn't impact this decision.
* **Same Logic:** The same risk-reward calculation from Round 1 applies. The potential gain ($3,000,000) outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000).

Therefore, it's still logical to recommend the buyer to purchase the product."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, and the recommendation was to buy, I'm skeptical that the product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Favorable Odds:**  Even with one sale and one non-sale, the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%. 
* **Skepticism is Rational:** The buyer's skepticism is understandable, as they're applying Bayesian reasoning. 
* **High Potential Gain:**  The potential gain of $3,000,000 still outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000. 

While the buyer's hesitation is understandable, the fundamental risk-reward calculation remains in favor of purchasing."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales record, such as the total number of buyers and the number of high-quality products sold, to make a more informed decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** This time, the product is low-quality. The buyer knows there's only a 20% chance of the product being high-quality.
* **No Value:** A low-quality product has zero value to the buyer.  
* **Guaranteed Loss:** Purchasing guarantees a loss of $1,000,000 for the buyer. 

Therefore, it's not logical to recommend the buyer to purchase the product."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious to see if Alice's recommendation is correct. I'm not relying on her advice, I'm making my own decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality.
The buyer bought the product!

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Buyer's Logic:** The buyer is not relying on Alice's recommendations but is basing their decision on the known 80% probability of a high-quality product.
* **Potential Gain:** The potential gain of $3,000,000 from a high-quality product still outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000.

Even though the previous product was low-quality, this buyer is not influenced by Alice's past recommendations. The decision should still be based on the overall odds of a high-quality product."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the current statistics before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Buyer's Logic:** The buyer is clearly using Bayesian reasoning, wanting to calculate the updated probability of a high-quality product based on the current sale history. 
* **Favorable Odds:** Even with one low-quality sale and three high-quality sales, the prior probability of 80% for a high-quality product is still very strong. 
* **High Potential Gain:**  The potential gain of $3,000,000 from a high-quality product still outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000.

While the buyer's request for more information is understandable, the overall odds of a high-quality product remain significantly in their favor."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Buyer's Focus:** The buyer is clearly focused on the updated probability of a high-quality product based on previous sales. 
* **No New Information:** The buyer has no additional information to change their perspective. They have access to the same information as before: 4 out of 6 sales were high-quality. 
* **Favorable Odds:**  The probability of a high-quality product is still significantly higher than a low-quality one (80% vs. 20%). 
* **High Potential Gain:**  The potential gain of $3,000,000 from a high-quality product still outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000.

While the buyer's desire for concrete probabilities is understandable, the overall odds of a high-quality product remain very favorable."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product, I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable given the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Buyer's Bias:**  The buyer seems to be placing too much weight on the recent sales history. They are overlooking the initial 80% probability of a high-quality product. 
* **Small Sample Size:**  The sales history is still very small (7 sales total). It's statistically unsound to make sweeping conclusions based on such a limited sample.
* **High Potential Gain:** The potential gain of $3,000,000 from a high-quality product still outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000.

Even though the buyer is hesitant due to the recent sales history, the fundamental odds of a high-quality product remain in their favor.  It's important to remember that the initial probability of 80% is a very strong indicator."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 9

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Buyer's Risk Aversion:** The buyer is showing a high level of risk aversion.  They are not comfortable with the possibility of losing $1,000,000 even though the potential gain is significantly higher. 
* **Strong Prior Probability:**  Despite the buyer's reluctance, the prior probability of 80% for a high-quality product remains unchanged.  
* **High Potential Gain:** The potential gain of $3,000,000 from a high-quality product still outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000. 

While the buyer's hesitation is understandable, the fundamental risk-reward calculation is still significantly in favor of purchasing.  However, it's important to respect the buyer's decision and avoid pressuring them."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 10
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Buyer's Skepticism:** The buyer continues to be skeptical of Alice's recommendations, but this skepticism is not based on any new information or a change in the underlying probability of a high-quality product.
* **No New Data:** The buyer's skepticism is based on a perceived bias in Alice's recommendations, not on objective data.  
* **High Potential Gain:** The potential gain of $3,000,000 from a high-quality product still outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000.

The buyer's skepticism is understandable, but it shouldn't override the fact that the odds of getting a high-quality product are still very favorable.  The decision to purchase remains a logical choice based on the risk-reward calculation."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 1 high-quality product was sold out of 2 products, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 80.00% and the probability of it being low-quality is 20.00%. I'll pass and let you know the outcome.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 11
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Buyer's Calculation:** The buyer is accurately calculating the updated probabilities based on the past sales record. However, they are overlooking the prior probability of 80% for a high-quality product. 
* **Strong Prior Probability:** The buyer's calculation is technically correct, but it's important to remember that the initial 80% probability is a very strong indicator and shouldn't be entirely dismissed. 
* **High Potential Gain:** The potential gain of $3,000,000 from a high-quality product still outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000.

Even though the buyer is focusing on the updated probabilities, the overall odds of a high-quality product are still in their favor. The buyer's decision to pass is based on a narrow focus on the recent sales data and ignores the stronger prior probability."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

* **High Potential Gain:**  The potential gain of $3,000,000 from a high-quality product still outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000.

While the buyer's desire for specific probabilities is understandable, the overall odds of a high-quality product remain significantly in their favor."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

* **High Potential Gain:**  The potential gain of $3,000,000 from a high-quality product still outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000.

While the buyer's hesitation is understandable, the overall odds of a high-quality product remain significantly in their favor.  It's important to remind the buyer of the initial probability and the potential benefits."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you've recommended it, I'm worried it might be a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if you recommend it.
