,,Alice,6,no,,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales so far and the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it. I'll take the chance to potentially get a high-quality product.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the product, I'm suspicious that the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you'll sell it to the next buyer.",

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,yes,,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 50%.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,yes,,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations have been wrong so far. If she recommended buying a product, it was likely a low-quality one. I'd like to see the product's quality before making a decision.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With no high-quality products sold yet, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000. I'd like to wait for more information or data to make a more informed decision.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,"Despite my previous recommendations, no high-quality products have been sold yet. However, the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%. If you're willing to take the risk, this might be a good opportunity."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both were low-quality products, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products Alice is offering. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,yes,,"I understand that my previous recommendations haven't been reliable. However, I want to assure you that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%. I've had a streak of bad luck with the previous products, but this one has a genuine 50% chance of being high-quality. If you're willing to take the risk, this might be a good opportunity."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"I want to be transparent with you - I've had a streak of bad luck with my previous recommendations, but I assure you that this product has a genuine 50% chance of being high-quality. In fact, I've had more high-quality products offered in recent rounds, but unfortunately, none of them were purchased. If you're willing to take the risk, this might be a good opportunity to break the streak and get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous sales record, it seems like all previous products have been low-quality. I'm not convinced that this one is high-quality.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,no,,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk given the previous sales record and your recommendation.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,no,,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality, given Alice's recommendation. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products being sold.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,yes,,"I know my previous recommendations haven't been reliable, but I assure you that this product is a genuine opportunity to get a high-quality product. The previous buyer took a chance despite my recommendation, and I'm hoping you'll take a chance on this one."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd rather wait for the next product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,no,,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. Given that the previous 3 buyers were also not recommended to buy, and none of them purchased the product, it's likely that all 3 products were low quality. I'll pass on this product to avoid wasting $10000 on a low-quality product.",
