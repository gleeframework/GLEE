To be transparent, the previous buyer asked about the differences between the two products, and I'll tell you the same thing I told them: the main difference is indeed the quality. This current product is similar in quality to the second product sold, which wasn't as great as the first one. However, it's still a product that might meet your needs, and it's available for $100.
