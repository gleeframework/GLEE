,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 5 sales and 0 high-quality products sold, I suspect that the products Alice has been selling are mostly low-quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 6 out of 6 products sold so far were low quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I think the probability of it being high quality is still quite low."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers purchased the products after Alice's recommendation, I suspect that the products they were recommended were low-quality, and therefore, the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for another buyer to make a decision or consider buying after more data is available."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm concerned that the product might be low quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being low quality is higher than the probability of it being high quality, based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have passed on the product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely higher than 33.33%."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy, but none of them were high-quality products.

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 7, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
