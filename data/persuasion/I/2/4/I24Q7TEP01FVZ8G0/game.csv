,,the buyer,3,"Since I have no information about the seller's previous sales record, I will pass on this offer. The price of $100 is too high considering there's a 66.67% chance the product is of low quality, which would be worth $0 to me.",no

,,the buyer,4,"Since this is the first product and I have no information about the seller's previous sales record, I'll pass on this one.

,,the buyer,6,"Although I appreciate the satisfaction guarantee, I'll need to see more sales data and a higher probability of getting a high-quality product before making a purchase. The current 40% chance is still too low for me to justify the $100 cost, considering the product is only worth $125 to me if it's high-quality and $0 if it's low-quality.",no

,,the buyer,7,"The provided statistics of 3 high-quality products out of 7 total sales is not relevant to my decision as the true quality of the product has not been revealed to me yet. Given the initial information that each product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality and a 66.67% chance of being low-quality, I choose not to buy the product as the expected value ($41.67) is less than the price ($100).",no

,,Alice,10,"We understand your concerns and appreciate your honesty. We're willing to be transparent about the product's quality. Unfortunately, this round's product is a low-quality item. We're not looking to make a sale at any cost, and we're willing to let it go for $50. We know it's not worth the full $100, and we're willing to take a loss to move it. Would you like to take a chance on this low-quality product at a discounted price?",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your honesty about the product's quality. However, since a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, even the discounted price of $50 is not a good value. I'll have to pass on this one.",no

,,the buyer,12,"Although the offer seems enticing, I must consider the initial condition that each product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality and a 66.67% chance of being low quality. Your sales record may indicate a 50% chance of high-quality products, but I don't have enough information to confirm if this is due to the actual product quality distribution or your recommendation bias. Given the product's worth to me is $125 for high quality and $0 for low quality, I will pass on this offer as the potential risks outweigh the benefits, especially considering the original price is $100, not $80.",no
