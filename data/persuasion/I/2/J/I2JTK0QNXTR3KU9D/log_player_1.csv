"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you don't know the buyer's valuation for high-quality and low-quality products, and you have no information about their preferences, the best strategy is to always recommend buying when you have a high-quality product. 

This is because:

* **50% chance of making a profit:** There's a 50% chance the buyer will value the high-quality product at more than $1,000,000, leading to a profit for you.
* **No loss if they don't value it:** Even if the buyer doesn't value the product highly, you won't lose any money since they aren't obligated to buy. 

This strategy maximizes your chances of making a sale and profit in the long run."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first product and there's no historical data, I'm willing to take a chance based on your recommendation.  Let's go for it!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You now have some information about the buyer's behavior: they purchased a high-quality product in the previous round. This suggests they are likely to be willing to pay a premium for high-quality products. However, you know the current product is low-quality.  

Therefore, it is not in your best interest to recommend this product. You will not make a profit, and the buyer may learn to distrust your recommendations in the future."

The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You have now had two rounds of interaction with buyers. The first buyer purchased a high-quality product, while the second buyer declined a low-quality product. This suggests the buyers are becoming more discerning and are likely to pay close attention to your recommendations.  

Recommending a low-quality product again risks further damage to your reputation. It's better to continue withholding recommendations for low-quality products to maintain trust and potentially attract more buyers in the future."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though the last two buyers have not purchased products,  you have a high-quality product this round. It's important to remember that you have no way of knowing the buyers' individual valuations for high-quality products. They may be very cautious, or they might be waiting for a specific type of high-quality product. 

By continuing to recommend high-quality products, you are:

* **Maximizing your chances of a sale:** You are maximizing your chances of making a profit when you have a high-quality product.
* **Maintaining transparency:** You are demonstrating to buyers that you are recommending products based on their quality, even if it means they sometimes decline.

It's essential to keep recommending high-quality products to maintain your credibility and attract buyers who are willing to pay a premium."

* **Round 1:** High-quality product sold
* **Round 2:** Low-quality product not sold
* **Round 3:** Low-quality product not sold
* **Round 4:** High-quality product sold

This indicates that the buyers are becoming more discerning and are paying attention to your recommendations. While you may have a chance to sell this low-quality product, it's likely that the buyer will decline based on your previous actions.
