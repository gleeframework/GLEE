high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, it seems like the probability of getting a high-quality product is quite low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of your recommendations so far, and I'd like to make my own decision based on the statistics.

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not convinced by the lack of sales of high-quality products so far. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any different.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product at a fixed price of $100."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the previous sales record?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd rather wait for a different product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's previous sales record, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality and not worth the $100 price tag. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Are you basing it solely on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product, or is there something specific about this product that you think I should know?"

high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I think it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice didn't recommend it, which makes me slightly more likely to think it's low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product at a good price, but I'm aware that I might get a high-quality product at a bad price."
