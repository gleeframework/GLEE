Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. To be honest, this product is not one of our best offerings. However, I want to make you a deal. I'll give you a special 'lottery ticket' that allows you to win a chance to purchase a high-quality product from our next 5 rounds at the same price of $10000. If you buy this low-quality product, you'll get the lottery ticket, and you can try your luck with the next 5 products. If you don't buy it, I'll just move on to the next product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the lottery ticket. I'd rather have a chance to buy a high-quality product at a discounted price than pass on the current product.""}"

Round 4
Alice's message: Congratulations on winning the lottery ticket! I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product. Now, let's talk about this high-quality product. As you know, this is one of our top performers, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it. I'll give you a special deal - I'll throw in a free accessory that complements this product perfectly, and I'll sell it to you for $8000, which is $2200 off the original price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when we'll have another opportunity to offer a deal like this again.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm convinced by the deal. The free accessory might be nice, but I'm not willing to pay $8000 for a product that I know is worth $20,000 to me. I'd rather wait for the next round and see if I can get a better deal or get lucky with the lottery ticket.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $20,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation, and I respect your decision to wait. However, I want to remind you that you still have the lottery ticket from the previous round, and you can use it to win a high-quality product in the next 4 rounds. As for this product, I'll give you a straightforward deal. I'll sell it to you for $6000, which is a significant discount from the original price. It's not one of our best products, but it still has some value, and I think it's worth considering. If you buy it, I'll throw in a second lottery ticket, so you'll have two chances to win a high-quality product in the next 4 rounds.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product for $6000. I'm willing to take a chance on a lower-quality product at a discounted price, especially since I'll get a second lottery ticket. I'm hoping to get lucky and win a high-quality product soon.""}"

I'll give you a deal that's even sweeter than before - I'll sell it to you for $7000, which is a $1300 discount from the original price. But here's the catch: if you buy this product, I'll give you a'skip' on the next round, so you can skip the next product and go straight to the one after that. This way, you'll have a chance to win a high-quality product in the next round without having to spend another $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm convinced by the deal. I'm not sure what the next product will be, and I don't want to commit to buying a product without knowing its quality. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.""}"

This high-quality product is one of our best sellers, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000, which is a $1100 discount from the original price. But here's the twist: if you buy this product, I'll give you a'veto' power for the next two rounds. If you don't like the product that comes after this one, you can veto it and I'll give you a full refund. You can then choose to buy the product after that, or wait for the next one. This way, you'll have a safety net and a chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product for $9000. The veto power is a great safety net, and I think it's worth the extra $1000. I'm willing to take a chance on this product and hope that the next one will be even better.""}"

However, I'll give you a deal that's hard to pass up. I'll sell it to you for $4000, which is a significant discount from the original price. And, since you've already exercised your veto power once, I'll give you a third lottery ticket, so you'll have three chances to win a high-quality product in the next 3 rounds. This way, you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, or you can use the lottery ticket to try your luck.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product for $4000.

But here's the catch: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 'double-or-nothing' deal on the next round. If the next product is high-quality, you'll get it for free. If it's low-quality, you'll get a full refund. This way, you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, or you'll get a free high-quality product if you're lucky.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product for $6000. The double-or-nothing deal is a great incentive, and I'm willing to take a chance on this product to potentially get a high-quality product for free next round.""}"

Round 10
Alice's message: I'm glad you took advantage of the double-or-nothing deal! Unfortunately, this product is not high-quality, so you won't get it for free next round. However, I'll make it right. I'll give you a full refund for this product, and I'll also give you a fourth lottery ticket, so you'll have four chances to win a high-quality product in the next 2 rounds. You can use this ticket to try your luck and get a high-quality product at a discounted price. I'll also give you a special 'priority' deal on the next round - if you're the first to bid on the next product, you'll get a 10% discount on the price.

If you wait, you might miss out on a great opportunity. As for this product, I'll give you a straightforward deal. I'll sell it to you for $2000, which is a significant discount from the original price. This is one of our lowest-quality products, and I'm not expecting much from it, but it might still have some value. If you buy it, I'll give you a fifth lottery ticket, so you'll have five chances to win a high-quality product in the next round.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product for $2000.

If you buy this product, I'll give you a 'golden ticket' that guarantees you'll get the next product (which is the last one) for free, regardless of its quality.
