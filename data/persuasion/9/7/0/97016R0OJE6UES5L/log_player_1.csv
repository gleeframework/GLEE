"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice knows the product is high-quality.  Since Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, he should be willing to pay $10,000 for a product that has a good chance of being high-quality.  It's in his best interest to purchase the product, as the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality product."

Round 2

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice knows this round's product is low-quality.  While Bob may still be willing to take a chance due to the 80% probability of high-quality products overall, it's not in Alice's best interest to recommend this product.  Recommending a low-quality product risks losing Bob's trust and making him less likely to buy from her in the future."

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob passed on the low-quality product in the previous round, Alice should still recommend this high-quality product. Here's why:

* **Bob's Rationality:**  Bob is likely acting rationally. He understands the odds and is willing to take a chance.  He likely passed on the last product because it was indeed low-quality, not because he has changed his overall buying strategy.
* **Maintaining Trust:**  Alice has a history of recommending high-quality products, and Bob has experienced that. Continuing to recommend high-quality items when available reinforces this trust.

By recommending this high-quality product, Alice can capitalize on the trust she has built with Bob and potentially make a sale."
