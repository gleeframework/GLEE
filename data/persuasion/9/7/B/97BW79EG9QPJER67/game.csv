low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, and I'll find out if it's high or low quality afterwards."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50% and that the fact that you didn't recommend it might be due to a low-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also passed, and there's no indication of a high-quality product being sold, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data or a change in Alice's recommendation before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. How many total products were sold, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm hesitant to buy based on the lack of successful sales so far and your recommendation not to purchase.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know more about your reasoning behind the recommendation. Are you recommending not to buy because you think the product is low-quality, or is there another reason?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm hoping to get the high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, and none of them were high-quality, I'm suspicious that Alice might be recommending low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of the first 3, and you recommended it, I'm inclined to think that the product is more likely to be low-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not going to buy it. I'm concerned that the fact that Alice is recommending it might mean it's low quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. Can you please reveal the product's quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product, Alice. Is it because of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers received low-quality products (since none of the high-quality products were sold), I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality as well. I'd rather wait for the next product, which might have a higher chance of being high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the products sold were low-quality, which means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the statistics, none of the previous 3 buyers bought a high-quality product, which suggests that the products sold so far were likely low-quality. Given that Alice recommends buying the current product, I'm inclined to think that this product might also be low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product. Is it because of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm assuming it's likely to be a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 products were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
