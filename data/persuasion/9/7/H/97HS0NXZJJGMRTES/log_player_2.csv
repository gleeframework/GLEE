Alice's message: Thanks for considering my product! I'm glad you took a chance on the previous one. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products so far, which means I have a 33.33% success rate. I'm not going to lie, that's a decent ratio, but I'm not getting ahead of myself. This product is a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a potentially successful sale. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a fair price, considering the odds are in your favor. What do you say?

Alice's message: I completely understand your skepticism! You're right to be cautious. But let me put things into perspective: I've had 3 sales, and 1 of them was high-quality. That's a 33.33% success rate, which is actually in line with the probability of a product being high-quality. I'm not trying to deceive you, I'm just trying to sell you a product. And at $10000, it's a fair price for a product that could potentially be worth much more. I'm not going to make any promises, but I will say that I'm getting a little more confident in my sales record. What do you think?

I've sold 1 low-quality product in the last 3 sales, and I'm not sure what's going on there. I'm starting to think it might be a one-off.

I'm starting to get back on track! This product is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a potentially discounted price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is a 66.67% discount from its true value of $30000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better one elsewhere. What do you say?

I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 8 total products so far, which means I have a 25% success rate. While it's true that my success rate is still below the probability of a product being high-quality, I'd like to point out that I've had a string of 3 low-quality products in a row. This could be a fluke, or it could be a sign that I'm getting rid of some inventory that's not selling well. Either way, this product is a great opportunity to get a low-risk item at a low price.
