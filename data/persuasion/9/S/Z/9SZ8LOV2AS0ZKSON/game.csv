low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've seen the numbers, I've sold 1 product so far, and it was a low-quality one. I'm not trying to hide anything from you. If I were selling high-quality products, wouldn't you expect to see a higher success rate by now? The odds are against me, and that's why I'm offering this product to you at a fixed price of $1000000. It's a calculated risk, but one that could potentially pay off in a big way. What do you say?",
