low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since it's the first product and I have no information to go on. I'm hoping it's a high-quality one!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality based on the statistics, but since you're not recommending it, I'll pass on it. I'd like to know the quality of the product after my decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she hasn't sold any high-quality products yet, and she might be trying to get me to buy a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0, indicating a possible bias towards low-quality products?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't want to pass on the opportunity to possibly get a high-quality product. I'm aware that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%, and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this product.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if I buy it and it's low-quality, I'll lose $100. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products Alice is offering."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it seems likely that the products they bought were low-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the products before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so only because of the information that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low sales of high-quality products might indicate that the product I'm about to buy is low-quality, and I'll get a good deal."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that the products being recommended are likely low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have received low-quality products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 6 products were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product may also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 7 buyers have already passed on the product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current sales record before making a decision.
