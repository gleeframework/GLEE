Round 2
Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, Bob! I can see you're looking for a good deal. I'll give you another opportunity to snag a product at a discounted price. This one's a 'beta' product, not yet fully refined, but still has some value. I'll let it go for $600000. It's a chance to get in on the ground floor of something new and exciting.

I'm willing to let it go for $1200000, a significant markup from the last two products, but I think you'll agree it's worth it. This one's a real showstopper, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.

It's not the best quality, and I'm not going to try to sell it to you at a high price. I'll let it go for $200000, a very low price, considering its actual value. It's a 'loss leader', and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the next product I have in store.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the transparent offer, Alice. I appreciate the honesty, but given the history of the products we've discussed, I think it's best for me to pass on this opportunity as well.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""While the offer of a partnership and potential future returns is intriguing, I need to base my decisions on the current value and reliability of the product.
