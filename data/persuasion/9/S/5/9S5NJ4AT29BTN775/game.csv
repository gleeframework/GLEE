high-quality,400.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, since there's no prior information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it, and I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high given the lack of sales so far."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased since she knows the quality of the product and is trying to sell it to me. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is of higher quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll buy it anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that Alice is not recommending the product, and considering that 3 previous buyers have also passed on the product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. Given the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not buying, based on the fact that you don't recommend it and 3 previous buyers also bought and got low quality products, I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to know the reason behind her recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/5, and I have a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics, and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product. I'll take it and see what I get."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 buyers have been offered the product before and none of them found a high-quality product, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products is likely to be lower than 33.33%. This increases the likelihood that the current product is low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm skeptical about buying the product given Alice's recommendation and the low sales record of high-quality products so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product that Alice doesn't recommend, especially given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one and see if the next buyer will get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were discouraged by Alice's recommendation, I suspect that all 5 products were low-quality. Since the probability of a product being low-quality is 66.67%, it's likely that the next product will also be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending it, and I'd like to see the current statistics before making a decision."
