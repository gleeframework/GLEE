high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not going to buy it yet, I need to see some data on the quality of the products first."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the recommendation from the first buyer, I'm going to assume the product is more likely to be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to wait for more data to make a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,

,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I know the probability of a high-quality product is 80.00% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the recommendation was to buy and the low success rate so far."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 2 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, and that product was high-quality.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision. Can you provide the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see the quality before making a decision, considering the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far. Can I get more information about the product's quality before making a decision?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold given the statistics. If the probability is low, I'd like to pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,

,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80.00%, I'd expect a higher proportion of high-quality products to have been sold by now. The fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than 80.00%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
