,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy buyer. I respect that. Let me tell you something about this product. I've had other customers who have purchased high-quality products like this one, and they've been extremely satisfied. They've even been willing to pay more than $1000000 for them. I'm not saying you'll feel the same way, but I think it's worth a shot. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, and I'm willing to throw in a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied, I'll give you a full refund.",

,,Alice,5,"I see you're being cautious with the low-quality products. That's smart. This one is a different story, though. I've got a good feeling about this one. I've already sold one high-quality product to you, and I'm confident this one will be just as valuable. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price. I'll sell it to you for $800000. That's the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think you'll find it's worth it.",

I'm not trying to hide it from you. Given the streak of high-quality products we've had, I'm willing to make a very generous offer. I'll sell it to you for $200000. That's a huge discount, and I'm hoping you'll consider it a good value. It's not what I think it's worth, but I'm willing to take a loss on this one to keep the streak going.",
