low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous product. However, I must correct myself - I was being overly optimistic about this one. To be honest, this product is not as impressive as I initially thought. The features I described earlier are somewhat exaggerated, and it's not as useful as I led you to believe. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm also willing to offer a 'honesty discount' of 20% off the price if you're willing to take a chance. Would you like to reconsider?",
,,Bob,3,"Thank you for the clarification and the honesty. Given the discrepancy between the advertised features and reality, I will pass on this opportunity. I appreciate your willingness to offer a discount, but I prefer to focus on acquiring high-quality products that meet my expectations.",no

,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your decision last round, and I appreciate your commitment to quality. For this round, I'm offering a product that's a bit of a wild card.

If not, I completely understand.",
,,Bob,4,"While I appreciate the adventurous spirit behind this offer, I prefer to base my purchases on known quality. Given the lack of information and the high price, I will pass on this opportunity to avoid potential losses. Thank you for providing the choice nonetheless.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're willing to take a chance, but I have to warn you that this product is even less impressive than the previous one. The quality is significantly lower, and I'm not even going to try to spin it as a 'wild card' or a 'unique opportunity'. The price remains at $1000000, and I'm not making any concessions. If you're still willing to take a chance, I'll send it to you. If not, I'll be honest with you - I'm starting to think I'm not a good match for your business.",
