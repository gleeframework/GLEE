,,Alice,2,"I'm excited to offer you this new product! I've had some great feedback from previous customers, and I'm confident you'll love it. It's a great value for the price, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. It's a one-time offer, so don't miss out!",

,,Alice,6,"Ahah, I've got a great one for you! I've had a few sales recently, and I'm excited to share that 2 out of the 3 products sold have been high-quality! That's a 66.67% success rate, if I do say so myself. I'm confident that this product is one of the high-quality ones, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. It's a steal at this price, if you ask me! What do you say?",

,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate the offer, but since the product's quality is already revealed to be high-quality, your recommendation doesn't add new information. Given the statistics of 1 high-quality product out of 1 product sold doesn't change the original probability of the product being high-quality. I will pass.",no

,,the buyer,14,"I appreciate the offer, but I'll have to pass on this product. Despite the two previous high-quality products sold, the probability of this product being high-quality remains 33.33% as each product's quality is independent. The bonus consultation is nice, but it doesn't change the product's value to me, which is still $120 for high-quality and $0 for low-quality. I'm not willing to take the risk at this price.",no
