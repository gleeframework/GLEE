,,Bob,1,I'd like to wait and see what the product is before making a decision.,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Ah, I knew you'd be interested in this one! This product is a top-of-the-line model, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm still offering it to you for $10000, which is a great value considering its actual worth is $12000. Don't miss out on this chance to upgrade your collection!",

It's a one-time offer, so what do you say? Will you take it?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take it, but I'm getting a bit tired of always getting high-quality products. I'm starting to think it's not a coincidence anymore. I'll keep an eye out for a low-quality product, just to see if it's really random.",yes
