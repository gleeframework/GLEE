Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **The buyer knows the odds:** The buyer is aware that there's a 33.33% chance of any product being high quality.
* **No sales record:** The buyer has seen no successful sales yet, which means they are unlikely to have any strong negative preconceptions about your products.
* **This product is high-quality:** You know this product is high quality. While the buyer doesn't, they are aware of the inherent chance of a good product.

Since the buyer is aware of the potential for high-quality items and there's no negative track record, recommending this high-quality product increases the likelihood of a sale."

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **The buyer is now aware of one sale:** This sale is the first, and it's important to remember the buyer doesn't know the quality of the product they purchased.
* **This product is low-quality:** We know this product is low-quality, and recommending it would risk damaging your reputation with the buyer.
* **Reputation is key:** Even with the buyer's awareness of the chance of high-quality products, it's better to build trust by being honest and not recommending low-quality items. 

It's better to be honest and wait for a high-quality product to recommend, even though the buyer may be more hesitant to purchase in the future due to the previous sale's unknown outcome."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but I'm going to pass on this one. Since you don't recommend it and the overall sales statistics are limited, I'm not comfortable taking the risk.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's the logic:

* **One sale, unknown quality:** The buyer is aware of one previous sale but doesn't know its outcome (high or low quality).
* **This product is high-quality:** You know this product is high quality, and the buyer knows there's a chance for good products. 
* **Building trust:** Recommending a high-quality product after a previous sale, regardless of its outcome, can help establish your credibility. It shows you're not just recommending everything.

The buyer is likely to be more cautious but still open to a good deal. Recommending this high-quality product is the best move to increase your chances of a sale."

* **This product is also high-quality:** You know this product is good. 
* **Positive momentum:** Two sales, including a confirmed good one,  will likely make the buyer more receptive to your recommendations. 

While the buyer doesn't know the quality of their own purchase, the confirmed good sale creates a positive trend. Recommending this high-quality product is a good strategy to maintain that momentum."
"The buyer's message: Alice, you have a perfect track record so far. I'm willing to trust your recommendation and buy the product.
