Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 
Let's think about why.  

While Bob doesn't know the quality of the product, he knows the odds: 33.33% chance of being high quality and 66.67% chance of being low quality. This is the same chance for every product you offer. Since the price is fixed, the odds favor Bob buying. He might not make a profit on every purchase, but over time, he'll likely earn more than he loses."
