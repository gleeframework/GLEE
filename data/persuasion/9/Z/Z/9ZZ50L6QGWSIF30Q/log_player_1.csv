It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a discount!""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced that the probability of this product being high-quality is 50% given the previous sales record. The fact that 2 out of 3 sold products were high-quality might be a coincidence or a result of selection bias. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.

It's a risk-free way to get a great deal!""}"

I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with it. Plus, you can always get a 10% discount on your next purchase if you see a high-quality product!""}"
