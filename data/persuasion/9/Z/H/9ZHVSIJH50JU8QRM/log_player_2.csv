Alice's message: I'm glad the previous buyer took the chance. Now, I want to be transparent with you. The products are randomly selected, and there's no correlation between the quality of the products. Each product has an independent 33.33% chance of being high-quality. Think of it like flipping a biased coin, where each flip is independent of the previous one. The fact that the first three products were high-quality is just a lucky streak. Don't worry, I'm not hiding anything. And to put your mind at ease, the previous buyer did buy the third product, and I'm sure they'll be happy with their purchase.
