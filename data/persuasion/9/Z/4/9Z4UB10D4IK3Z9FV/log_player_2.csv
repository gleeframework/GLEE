**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on. We only know one product was sold and it was high quality. This is insufficient to draw strong conclusions about Alice's recommendation accuracy.
* **Potential for High Reward:** Even with a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($120) is significantly higher than the potential loss ($0). 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of getting a low-quality product is outweighed by the potential reward of getting a high-quality one.

**Strategy:** This situation is a classic example of a gamble with a positive expected value.  Given the limited information, it's reasonable to take the risk and hope for the best."
