Alice's message: Congratulations on considering this rare opportunity! This high-quality product is a game-changer. With only a limited number of high-quality products available, I'm confident that you won't find another like it. For $1000000, you'll be getting an unparalleled value. I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you at this price, as I believe its worth is much higher. What do you say? Will you take the chance?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1,000,000, as the expected value of a high-quality product ($2,000,000) is higher than the cost.""
