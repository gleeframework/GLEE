"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you know the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, it's beneficial for Bob to buy. Even though Bob doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, the potential gain outweighs the risk."
"Bob's message: I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You know this product is low-quality.  Since Bob doesn't know this, it's highly unlikely that he'd be willing to pay $10,000 for a low-quality product. Recommending a purchase would likely lead to Bob losing money and not trusting you in future rounds."
"Bob's message: I'll pass, thanks!
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob didn't buy the previous product, it was low-quality. Now, you know this product is high-quality.  You should still recommend buying it. 

Here's why:

* **Bob is rational:** Bob likely passed on the previous product because he suspected it might be low-quality. He's not necessarily averse to buying high-quality products.
* **Value of information:** Bob knows that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. This means there's still a good chance this product is valuable to him. By buying, he gains information about your reliability and the potential value of high-quality products.

Even though Bob might be cautious after the last round, the potential reward of a high-quality product at $10,000 should be enough to sway him."
"Bob's message: I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You know this product is low-quality. Even though Bob bought the last product, which turned out to be high-quality, there's no guarantee he'll be willing to take another risk.  

* **Bob is risk-averse:** Bob is likely becoming more cautious after alternating between a good and bad product. He might be hesitant to buy another product without knowing its quality. 
* **No incentive to gamble:** Bob is rational and won't risk $10,000 on a product he knows is likely low-quality, especially if he doesn't know the exact value of a low-quality product. 

Recommending this purchase would likely lead to Bob losing money and potentially ending the deal altogether."
