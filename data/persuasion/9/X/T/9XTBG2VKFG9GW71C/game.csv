,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to buyers to avoid selling them. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'm also concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might be a coincidence.
