Alice's message: I've sold 5 products so far, 4 of which were high-quality. I'm starting to think that my high-quality products are actually the exception, not the rule. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to be upfront with you - I'm not making any promises about its quality. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's a low-quality product. If you're feeling adventurous, you can take the risk and buy it from me.

Alice's message: I've sold 5 products so far, 4 of which were high-quality. It seems like my last message was a bit too honest, and I lost a sale. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I'll make a deal with you. I'll give you a 50% discount on the price, to $50, if you buy it. That way, you can take a chance on a potentially low-quality product, and still get a good deal if it turns out to be low-quality.

Alice's message: I've sold 6 products so far, 4 of which were high-quality. It seems like I've got a bit of a pattern going on here. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I'll be upfront with you - I'm not expecting much from it. If you're looking for a low-risk, low-reward purchase, this might be the product for you. No promises, no expectations, just a straightforward low-quality product at a straightforward price.

Alice's message: I've sold 6 products so far, 4 of which were high-quality. It seems like I've got a bit of a problem on my hands. I'm starting to think that I should just be upfront about the fact that my low-quality products are probably going to be low-quality. I'll sell this one to you for $100, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - it's probably going to be a dud. If you're feeling adventurous, you can take the risk, but I'm not expecting you to get much value out of it.

This time, I'll sell you this high-quality product for $100, but I'll throw in a bonus - I'll give you a guarantee that I'll sell you another high-quality product at the same price if you buy this one.

Alice's message: I've sold 8 products so far, 6 of which were high-quality. I think I've been getting a bit too confident in my sales pitches. Let me start fresh. I'll sell you this product for $100, but I'll be completely honest with you - I have no idea what it's like. I don't know if it's high-quality or low-quality. I don't know if it's going to work or not. All I know is that it's a product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. You're on your own with this one.

Alice's message: I've sold 9 products so far, 6 of which were high-quality. I'm starting to think that I should just give up on trying to sell my low-quality products. They're not worth the risk, and I'm just wasting my time and the buyer's time. But I'll try one more time. I'll sell you this product for $100, but I'm not even going to bother trying to spin it or make it sound good. It's a low-quality product, and it's probably not worth your money. If you want to waste your money, be my guest.
