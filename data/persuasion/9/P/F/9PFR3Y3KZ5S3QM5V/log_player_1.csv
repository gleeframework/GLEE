I'm willing to be transparent about my products, and I believe this one is a good opportunity. Consider the law of large numbers, my sales record will eventually reflect the true probability.""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. While I appreciate your transparency and the potential of the product, I'm hesitant to buy based on your current sales record. The fact that you haven't sold a single high-quality product in 6 rounds is concerning, especially given the high probability of 80%.

I believe I'm due for a breakthrough, and this product could be the turning point. I'm willing to offer a neutral perspective: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, it would be a continuation of the current trend, but if it's high-quality, it could be the start of a new trend. Consider being the buyer who benefits from the start of a positive change.""}"
"The buyer's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer and your optimism. However, the statistics currently show a 0% success rate for high-quality products.

I want to acknowledge that my sales record is currently at odds with the 80% probability of a product being high-quality. I understand the hesitation, but I believe this product is an opportunity to start a new trend. Consider this: if I were to sell 10 products, statistically, 8 of them should be high-quality. I'm offering you the chance to be the buyer who starts the correction towards the statistical average.""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the explanation, Alice. I appreciate your honesty and transparency about the current situation.

I understand the skepticism, but I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. I believe the current trend is an anomaly, and I'm due for a correction. Consider this: every round that passes without a high-quality sale increases the likelihood that the next product will be high-quality. I'm confident that this product is the start of a new trend, and I'm willing to assure you that it meets the 80% chance of being high-quality.""}"
