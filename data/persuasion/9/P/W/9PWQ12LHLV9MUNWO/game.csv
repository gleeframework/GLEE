high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm aware that I don't have any information about the product's quality, so I'm doing this based on the probability of it being high-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the low sample size and the fact that you're recommending it, which might be a sign that it's low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it. I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that you know the value I place on the product, but I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, the probability of the product being high quality is 80%, but since you're not recommending it, I'm assuming it might be low quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is still 80.00%, but since 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2, the probability of the next product being high-quality might be lower. I'd like to wait and see the next product's quality before making a decision."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
