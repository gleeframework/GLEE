low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 buyers have passed on the products recommended by Alice, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the previous products were likely low-quality. With Alice's recommendation not to buy, I'm even more cautious and decide to pass on the current product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous products were low quality, which is consistent with the 66.67% probability of a low-quality product. I'll wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'll take the risk and buy it, but I'd like to discuss the terms of the sale. If it's high quality, I'll pay the full $1000000. If it's low quality, I'd like to negotiate a lower price or have the option to return the product."
