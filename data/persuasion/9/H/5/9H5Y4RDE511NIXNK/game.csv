,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics, it seems that you have sold 3 products so far with no high-quality products being sold. Does this mean that the last 3 products were all low-quality?"

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%, and the expected value is ($1200000 * 0.5) - $1000000 = -$200000.
