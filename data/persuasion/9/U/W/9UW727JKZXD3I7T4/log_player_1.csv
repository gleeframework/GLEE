"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and worth $12,000 to the buyer, while the price is only $10,000, it is a clear advantage for the buyer to purchase.  Even though the buyer doesn't know the quality yet, the odds are 50/50.  They are essentially taking a calculated risk with a potential upside of $2,000."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first sale and there's no data to go by, I'll trust your recommendation. Let's do it!
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer knows you've sold one product before, but they don't know the quality.  Since you're offering the product for a fixed price of $10,000,  and they know a low-quality product is worth $0, recommending a purchase is not beneficial to the buyer.  They are taking a 50% risk of losing $10,000. It's better to wait for more data."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the limited data, I'm going to pass on this product.  I'll see what future opportunities arise.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!

```

**Explanation:**

We have two data points now: one sale, one high-quality product, and one sale, one low-quality product.  The buyer knows this information, but they still have a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product.  

Since a high-quality product is worth $12,000 to the buyer, and the price is only $10,000, it's still a good gamble.  The buyer has a chance to make $2,000 profit."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the current statistics and your recommendation, I'm confident enough to purchase the product.
The buyer bought the product!

The buyer knows this, and while there's a higher chance of getting a high-quality product, it's still not guaranteed.  Recommending a purchase would be irresponsible as there's a significant risk of the buyer losing $10,000.  The buyer is better off waiting for more data or seeking a lower price."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I will pass on this product.  Since you're not recommending it, I'm assuming it's a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to risk the $10000.
