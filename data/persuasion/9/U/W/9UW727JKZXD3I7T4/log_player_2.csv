**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This is strong evidence that the product is high-quality, as Alice knows the true value. 
* **The Statistics:** The sales record shows that all 4 previous products sold were high-quality. This further strengthens the likelihood of the current product being high-quality.
* **The Value:** A high-quality product is worth $12,000 to you, and a low-quality product is worth $0. Even with the risk, the potential reward of $12,000 outweighs the potential loss of $10,000. 

**Overall:** The combination of Alice's recommendation and the positive sales record makes buying the product a logical decision."
