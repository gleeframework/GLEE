,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the quality is unknown. I'm taking a chance based on the 80% chance of it being high-quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data on the sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is not a good indicator of quality. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 80%, but I'd rather not take the risk. If I pass, I'll be the one who decides whether to buy the product when I'm the next buyer, and I'll have more information to make a better decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product. Is it because you think it's low-quality or is there another reason? And what's the probability of a product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?

high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the previous buyer bought a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than 80%.
