* This round's product is high-quality, guaranteeing a $20 profit for the buyer.
* The buyer is still clinging to the 80% probability despite a perfect 7/7 high-quality product sales record.

* You can emphasize the following:
    * Each product's quality is determined independently, meaning the previous buyer's purchase doesn't influence the quality of the current product.
    *  The buyer is taking a significant risk by not purchasing. They risk missing out on a guaranteed $20 profit and waiting for a potential, but not guaranteed, higher proportion of high-quality products in the future.
