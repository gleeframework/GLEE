,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as there's no information on its quality yet. I'd like to wait and see the outcome of the next buyer's purchase to get a better understanding of the product's quality distribution."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'm going to take the risk, hoping it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward. I'd like to know the product's quality after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to take advantage of the low price and the fact that the previous two buyers didn't buy it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. Can you provide more information about the previous buyers who purchased the products?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there a pattern or data that led you to advise against buying this product?
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous three buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the products offered so far have been low quality. I'd like to see if the next product is high quality before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the fact that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products sold so far were low quality. I'm skeptical about this product and will pass on it. If 3 out of 3 products were low quality, the probability of the next product being high quality is likely higher than 33.33%. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, especially since 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests the probability of a high-quality product might be lower than 33.33%. I'm hoping to get a good deal."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, which suggests a very low probability of a high-quality product being offered. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800000 due to the high probability of it being low quality and the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the fact that 6 previous buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to take a pass. I think the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
