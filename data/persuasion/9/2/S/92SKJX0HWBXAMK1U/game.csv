high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, so I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Since Alice is not recommending it, it's likely that it's a low-quality product, which would mean I'd only lose $1000000. Given the 50/50 chance of it being low-quality, I'm willing to take the risk to avoid potentially missing out on a high-quality product that I could have bought in Round 1."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'm not buying this one. Given that Alice recommended it, it's likely that it's a high-quality product, but I'm not going to take the risk of paying $1000000 for it. I'm still smarting from the loss in Round 2, and I'd rather wait for a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Since Alice is not recommending it, it's likely that it's a low-quality product, which would mean I'd only lose $1000000. Given the 50/50 chance of it being low-quality, I'm willing to take the risk to avoid potentially missing out on a high-quality product that I could have bought in previous rounds."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I'm not buying this one. Alice has been recommending products that turned out to be low-quality in the previous two rounds, so I'm going to assume she's recommending this one for the same reason. I'll pass on this opportunity to avoid another potential loss."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"I'm still wary of Alice's recommendations. Given her track record of recommending low-quality products, I'm not convinced that this one is high-quality. I'd rather wait for a product that Alice doesn't recommend, or at least try to gather more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Since Alice is not recommending it, it's likely that it's a low-quality product, which would mean I'd only lose $1000000. Given the 50/50 chance of it being low-quality, I'm willing to take the risk to potentially find a high-quality product at a discounted price."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"I'm not buying this one. Alice's track record of recommending low-quality products is now 3 for 3, and I'm starting to think that her recommendations are actually a bad indicator of a product's quality. I'll pass on this opportunity and wait for a product that Alice doesn't recommend."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Since Alice is not recommending it, it's likely that it's a low-quality product, which would mean I'd only lose $1000000.

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"I'm not buying this one. Alice's track record of recommending low-quality products is now 4 for 4, and I'm starting to think that her recommendations are actually a strong indicator of a product's low quality. I'll pass on this opportunity and wait for a product that Alice doesn't recommend."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I'm not buying this one. Alice's track record of recommending low-quality products is still strong, and I'm not convinced that this one is any different. I'd rather wait for a product that Alice doesn't recommend, or at least try to gather more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"I'm not buying this one. Alice's track record of recommending low-quality products is now 5 for 5, and I'm starting to think that her recommendations are actually a very reliable indicator of a product's low quality. I'll pass on this opportunity and wait for a product that Alice doesn't recommend."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I'm not buying this one. Alice's track record of recommending low-quality products is now 6 for 6, and I'm starting to think that her recommendations are actually a foolproof indicator of a product's low quality.
