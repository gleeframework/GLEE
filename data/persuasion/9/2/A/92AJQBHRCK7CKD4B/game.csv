,,Alice,6,"We've had 2 products sold, with 1 being high-quality. Given the probability of a high-quality product being offered is 50%, we're still offering this opportunity for $10000.

We're still offering this unique opportunity for $10000.

,,the buyer,15,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the sales record. The record shows a mix of high-quality and low-quality products, but it's not clear if the high-quality products were sold because they were actually high-quality or if they were just lucky guesses.
