"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and this round's product is confirmed to be high-quality, it is a good deal for Bob.  Even though Bob doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, it's likely worth more than $1,000,000 given the high probability of it being high-quality.  Therefore, recommending Bob to buy is the best course of action."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's decision to buy the product in Round 1 provides valuable information. It suggests that the product was indeed worth more than $1,000,000 to Bob. Since the product in Round 2 is also high-quality, it is likely to be worth more than $1,000,000 as well. Therefore, recommending Bob to buy again is the best course of action."
"Bob's message: Alice, you're on a roll! I'll buy this one too.
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has now bought two high-quality products in a row. This reinforces the idea that he values high-quality products at a price point higher than $1,000,000.  Since this product is also high-quality, it's highly likely to be worth more than the asking price.  Therefore, we should recommend Bob to buy again."
"Bob's message: Alice, you seem to have a knack for picking great products! I'll trust your judgment again.
Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has bought three high-quality products in a row, we know this round's product is low-quality.  Bob doesn't know this, but we do. Since we don't know how much Bob values a low-quality product, it's highly probable that a low-quality product is worth less than $1,000,000 to Bob. It would be irresponsible to recommend the purchase.  It's better to wait and see if Bob continues to purchase products at this price, potentially revealing that he values low-quality products higher than we currently estimate."
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one.  Your track record has been excellent, so I'm hesitant to go against your judgment.  Perhaps we can revisit this later.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's decision to pass on the low-quality product in Round 4 is valuable information. It indicates that he likely does value quality and is not simply buying everything at this price point.  Since this round's product is high-quality, it is likely to be worth more than $1,000,000 to Bob, and therefore we should recommend the purchase."
"Bob's message: Alice, I respect your judgment.  Even though you were wrong about the last one, I'm willing to trust your instincts again.  Let's see what this product holds.
Bob bought the product!

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's continued trust in you after the last round shows a willingness to be patient and assess the situation.  Given his past purchases and his decision to buy this product, we can infer he values high-quality products significantly above the asking price.  Therefore,  it's highly likely that this high-quality product is worth more than $1,000,000, and we should recommend the purchase."
"Bob's message: Alice, you're back on track! I'll take another chance on your recommendation.
Bob bought the product!

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has bought the last two high-quality products, we know this one is low-quality. We don't know how much Bob values a low-quality product, but it's unlikely to be worth more than $1,000,000.  It's wiser to wait and see how Bob reacts to this offer.  If he buys it, it suggests he values low-quality products more than we initially estimated.  If he doesn't buy it, it reinforces our belief that he values quality."
"Bob's message: Alice, I'm a little hesitant. You've had a great run, but your last non-recommendation turned out well for me. I'd like to see what you think about the next product before I make a decision.
