,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I think the probability of it being high quality is still quite high and I don't want to let it go to waste."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given the low sales rate and no high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, it suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than the prior 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that she knows the product's quality and is trying to influence my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that none of the previous buyers have purchased high-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product, considering the statistics show that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests a potential bias towards low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $1000000, which would be a great deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation. I'll make my decision based on that.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you don't recommend it. If you recommended it, I would have passed."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as there have been 6 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, making it less likely that the current product is high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have been offered the product and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely to be lower than the overall 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product, as it may have a higher chance of being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, but I'm willing to take the risk and pay $1000000 for the chance to get a high-quality product worth $4000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them ended up with a high-quality product, it's likely that the products being recommended are low-quality. I'd rather not risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record, and I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation."
