This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

In this scenario, Alice has revealed that the product is high-quality. Bob knows that a high-quality product is worth $1,200,000 to him, while the price is only $1,000,000. Therefore, it's a guaranteed profit for Bob, making it a clear recommendation to buy."

Perhaps some insight into its history or origin?  I'm trying to gather as much information as possible before making a decision.
