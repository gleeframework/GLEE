,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the low sales record so far?

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I will assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is 50% and the probability of being low-quality is 50%. Since Alice recommended the product, it's likely that she has some information that I don't, so I will err on the side of caution and pass on the product."
