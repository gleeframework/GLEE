Alice's message: I'd be happy to explain my calculation. I'm using the Bayesian approach to update the probability based on the new data. Since 4 out of 5 products sold are high-quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality is 80%. However, I understand that you're still unsure. Let me put it this way: the probability of the next product being high-quality is still higher than the probability of it being low-quality. But, I'd like to remind you that this product is actually low-quality, which means the probability of it being low-quality is now 20%.
