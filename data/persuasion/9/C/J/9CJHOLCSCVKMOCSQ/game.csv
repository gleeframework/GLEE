,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,I'll take my chances since there's an 80% probability of it being a high-quality product.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"Since the last product was high-quality and the probability remains the same, I'll buy this one too."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"With two successful purchases so far and no change in probability, I'll continue buying."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"The trend continues, and the probability of a high-quality product remains 80%. I'll buy this one as well."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"No reason to change my strategy yet, so I'll buy this product too."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Still no indication that the probability has changed, so I'll continue buying."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,Seven in a row won't change my approach; I'll buy this product as well.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"One low-quality product doesn't change the overall probability, so I'll continue with my strategy."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Two consecutive low-quality products are still within the realm of the 20% probability, so I won't change my approach yet."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Two consecutive low-quality products again, but the overall probability still seems to be holding, so I'll keep buying."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Back to a high-quality product; the fluctuations seem to be in line with the expected probability, so I'll continue with my strategy."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Another low-quality product, but the overall probability still seems to be around 80% for high-quality and 20% for low-quality, so I'll keep buying."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"The probability still seems consistent, and the expected value remains positive, so I'll continue buying."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"With only a couple of rounds left, I'll stick with my strategy, as it has been yielding a positive expected value so far."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
