Alice's message: I'm glad you're confident in my judgement! Given that you've already bought one high-quality product, I'll offer you a deal: if you buy this one, I'll give you the 100% guarantee for the next two products. Think of it as a 'high-quality streak' - if you buy this one, you'll have two high-quality products in a row, and I'll guarantee the next one as well.

You'll have a 'high-quality run' of four in a row, and I'll stand behind it. What do you think?
