,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of the sold products were high quality, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation from Alice."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous sales record, it seems that the products sold so far have been low quality, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high quality is higher than the overall probability.
