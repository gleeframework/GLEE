**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** This round's product is confirmed to be high-quality, worth $300 to the buyer.
* **Building Trust:** While there's still no sales record to showcase,  it's important to start building trust by recommending high-quality products whenever possible.
* **Value Proposition:** The buyer is offered a product worth significantly more than the asking price, which should be appealing even without a strong sales record.
* **Transparency:**  The previous buyer's request for reasoning could be addressed by being transparent about the quality of the product.  For example, you could say, ""This product is of a high quality. While I don't have a sales record yet, I want to be upfront about the quality of the items I offer."""

* **Avoiding Negative Feedback:** Recommending a low-quality product at this stage would likely result in a negative experience for the buyer and further damage any potential trust in future rounds.

**Recommendation:** It's crucial to build trust by offering high-quality products when possible, even if it means passing on low-quality ones in the early stages.  The current strategy risks alienating potential buyers."

    * **Share More Information:** Provide more information about the products and their origins to demonstrate transparency.

**Reasoning:**

* **No Trust:** The buyer is clearly not trusting your recommendations.  The pattern of previous low-quality product sales, despite your recommendations, has created a strong perception of untrustworthiness. 
* **Low-Quality Product:** This round's product is confirmed to be low-quality.
* **Avoiding Further Damage:** Recommending this product would likely reinforce the buyer's skepticism, potentially harming future sales. 

**Strategy:**  This is a crucial turning point.  You need to make a drastic shift in strategy, even if it means no sales for the next few rounds:

1. **Acknowledge the Problem:** Start the next round by acknowledging the lack of trust and the issues surrounding previous sales. Be direct and transparent. For example: ""I understand you might be hesitant based on past recommendations.  I'm aware that there's a lack of trust right now, and I want to assure you that I'm working on improving the situation."" 

2. **Transparency and Honesty:** Be completely honest about the quality of products.  You could say, ""I am committed to being completely transparent with you.  While this product is low-quality, I'm committed to offering only high-quality products in the future. ""

3. **Prioritize Quality:**  Make a public commitment to only offering high-quality products going forward. Even if it means passing on some potential sales, you need to show a genuine shift in your focus. 

4. **Offer Guarantees:** Consider offering a strong money-back guarantee for future products to build confidence in buyers.

5. **Seek Feedback:** Actively solicit feedback from buyers, even those who don't purchase. Use their feedback to improve your products and your approach to selling.

**It's a long road to rebuild trust, but it's the only way to secure future sales.** You need to demonstrate a complete change in strategy and a commitment to quality, transparency, and customer satisfaction."
