high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me given the current statistics. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%.
