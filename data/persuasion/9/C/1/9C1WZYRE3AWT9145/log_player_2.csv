Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase! I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product. As for this one, I'm a bit concerned that the previous product's high-quality might have been a fluke. I've done some internal testing, and I'm not as confident in this one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $500000, but I have to warn you, the chances are slim that this one is high-quality. It's a risk, but if you're feeling lucky, it might be worth a shot.

Alice's message: I understand you're being cautious, Bob. I'll be honest with you, this one is a bit of a dud. I've already informed my team to stop production on this particular model. However, I'm willing to let it go for a song. I'll sell it to you for $200000. It's a terrible product, and I'm practically giving it away. But hey, you might be able to salvage some parts or use it for testing purposes.
