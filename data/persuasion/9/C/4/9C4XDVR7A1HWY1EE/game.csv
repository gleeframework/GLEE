high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've now sold 3 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products, for a total of 6 sales. I want to point out that the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products is 3:3, which is roughly 50%. This product is a high-quality item, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'd like to ask you to consider the fact that you've seen a consistent pattern of 50% high-quality products, and this one is likely to follow that pattern.

However, I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and the last 2 high-quality products were sold consecutively, which is an interesting pattern.
