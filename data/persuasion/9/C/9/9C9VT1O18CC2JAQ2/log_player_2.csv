**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record indicates a 100% success rate (4/4) for high-quality products. This strongly suggests Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products and making reliable recommendations.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product further reinforces the likelihood it's high-quality, given her proven track record.
* **Potential Gain:**  The potential gain of $2,500 ($12,500 value - $10,000 price) outweighs the risk of a $10,000 loss if it turns out to be low-quality.

**It's important to note:**  This decision is based on the information provided. In reality, there's still a 20% chance the product is low-quality, even with Alice's recommendation and the successful sales history."

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The seller has sold 6 high-quality products in a row. This suggests a very high probability of the current product also being high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice is aware of the product's true quality and is recommending the purchase.  This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Potential Gain:** The potential reward ($12,500) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($0) given the high probability of the product being high quality.

**It's important to note:**  Even with the strong evidence, there's still a 20% chance the product could be low quality. However, the odds are heavily in your favor, making buying the product a rational decision."
