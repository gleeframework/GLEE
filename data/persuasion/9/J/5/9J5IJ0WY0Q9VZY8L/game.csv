If you're not interested, I'll be willing to sell it to someone else for a lower price. But if you buy it, I'll give you a 10% discount, making it $900000.",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate your offer, but since I don't know the quality of the product, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying it without more information. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for a product that I know is high quality, but I need more assurance before making a purchase.",no

,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me offer you a unique opportunity. I'll give you a chance to inspect the product for a short period of time, say 30 minutes, before making a decision. During this time, you can examine it thoroughly and determine its quality for yourself. If you're satisfied, you can purchase it for $1000000. If you're not, you can walk away without any obligation. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"That's a great offer, Alice. With the chance to inspect the product and determine its quality, I'm willing to take the risk. If I find it to be high-quality, I'll be happy to purchase it for $1000000. Please let me inspect the product.",yes

,,Alice,3,"Congratulations on making a great decision last time! Since you were able to inspect the product and verify its quality, I'm willing to offer you the same deal again. I'll let you inspect this new product for 30 minutes, and if you're satisfied with its quality, you can purchase it for $1000000. However, I'd like to add a twist: if you decide to buy it, I'll throw in a complimentary inspection report from a third-party expert, which will provide additional assurance about the product's quality. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"That sounds like a great offer, Alice. I appreciate the added assurance of the third-party expert's inspection report. Given the opportunity to inspect the product myself and the additional verification, I'm willing to purchase it for $1000000 if I find it to be high-quality.",yes

,,Alice,4,"You're on a roll, Bob! I'm glad you're enjoying the process. Since you've already had a positive experience with the previous products, I'll offer you an even more enticing deal. Not only will I provide the 30-minute inspection period and the third-party expert's report, but I'll also give you a 'no-questions-asked' return policy. If you purchase this product and later discover it's not what you expected, you can return it to me and I'll give you a full refund. I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations, but I want to give you complete peace of mind. What do you say?",

,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're confident, Bob. However, I want to make sure you're aware of something. Given the exceptional value I've been offering, I've decided to take a small risk and offer you a 'unique' product that's not part of my usual inventory. I've been told it's a one-of-a-kind item, and I'm not sure what to expect from it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to be upfront with you - I've been warned that it might not meet your expectations. You'll still get the 30-minute inspection period, the third-party expert's report, and the 'no-questions-asked' return policy. But I want to make it clear that this product is a bit of a wild card. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the assurances you've provided, including the inspection period, expert's report, and return policy, I'm willing to take a calculated risk on this unique product.

I'll give you the standard 30-minute inspection period, the third-party expert's report, and the 'no-questions-asked' return policy. But I'll also throw in a bonus: if you purchase this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on your next purchase, regardless of whether this product meets your expectations or not. This way, you'll get a guaranteed benefit either way. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the bonus offer, Alice. Although I took a loss on the previous product, I'm still confident in the process we've established. The 30-minute inspection, expert's report, and return policy give me a good level of assurance. The 10% discount on my next purchase is a nice added incentive. I'll take the chance and purchase this product for $1000000, knowing that I'll get a discount on my next purchase regardless of the outcome.",yes

,,Alice,7,"You're a true believer in the process, Bob! I'm glad you're seeing the value in the safeguards I've put in place. For this next product, I'll offer you a slight variation on the deal. I'll still provide the 30-minute inspection period, third-party expert's report, and 'no-questions-asked' return policy. But this time, I'll also give you a 'best-price-guarantee'. If you find a better offer on a similar product from a reputable seller within the next 30 days, I'll match that price and give you an additional 5% discount. What do you think?",

,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you appreciate the extra layer of protection, Bob. However, I want to be upfront with you - this next product is a bit of a departure from our usual high-quality offerings. I've been told it's a 'vintage' item, and while it may not be as polished as our usual products, it has a certain... character. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that it's not a typical product. You'll still get the 30-minute inspection period, third-party expert's report, and 'no-questions-asked' return policy, but I want to make sure you understand that this product is a bit of a wild card. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, given that this product is a departure from your usual high-quality offerings and is described as a 'vintage' item with a certain 'character', I'm not willing to take the risk. While the inspection period, expert's report, and return policy are reassuring, I've had a recent experience with a low-quality product that didn't meet my expectations. I'll err on the side of caution this time and decline the offer. I'm looking for products that meet the high standards we've established in our previous transactions.",no

,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you're confident in the process, Bob. However, I want to be upfront with you - this next product is a bit of a departure from our usual high-quality offerings. I've been told it's a 'proof-of-concept' item, and while it may not be fully developed, it has a lot of potential. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that it's a bit of a risk. You'll still get the 30-minute inspection period, third-party expert's report, and 'no-questions-asked' return policy, but I want to make sure you understand that this product is still in its infancy. I'll also offer you a special 'beta-tester' discount: if you're willing to take on the risk, I'll give you a 20% discount on the price if you're willing to provide feedback and help me improve the product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, given that this product is a 'proof-of-concept' item and still in its infancy, I'm not willing to take on the risk. While the inspection period, expert's report, and return policy are reassuring, I've had a recent experience with a low-quality product that didn't meet my expectations. The 'beta-tester' discount is attractive, but I don't think it's enough to offset the risk of purchasing an unproven product. I'll decline the offer and wait for a more established product that meets the high standards we've established in our previous transactions.",no

But I'll also throw in a 'priority access' guarantee: if you purchase this product, I'll give you priority access to our next high-quality product, which will be released within the next 30 days. This means you'll get to be one of the first to see and purchase the new product, and you'll have the opportunity to get a great deal on it before it's available to the general public. What do you think?",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate your understanding and willingness to provide extra value, Alice. The 'priority access' guarantee is a great addition to the usual safeguards.

What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, given that this product is a 'limited edition' item and not a typical product, I'm not willing to take on the risk.
