"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know the product is high-quality.  Since Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and you are offering it at a fixed price, it's a good gamble for Bob. Even if the product is worth less than $10,000 to him, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm not sure I trust your judgment. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You know this product is low-quality. Since you don't know how much a low-quality product is worth to Bob, there's a high risk that he'll be unhappy with the purchase.  It's better to avoid recommending a product you know to be low-quality, especially after Bob has already expressed skepticism about your judgment."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the info, but I'll stick with my gut and pass on this one too.  It's better to be safe than sorry.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has passed on the first two offers, it's still a good idea to recommend this product. Here's why:

* **High-quality:** You know this product is high-quality, which is valuable information.
* **No Discount:**  You can't change the price, so Bob's only risk is that he might not value the product enough.
* **Building Trust:** While Bob is skeptical now, you can start building trust by being honest. Recommending a good product when you know it's good might encourage him to consider future offers.

While it's possible Bob will decline again, there's a chance this honest recommendation will start to change his mind and lead to a sale in future rounds."
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one. Your track record isn't inspiring me with confidence.
Bob didn't bought the product.

```

**Explanation:**
