low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the probability of it being low-quality based on the given statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or her desire to discourage sales. I'm willing to take the risk."

Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%.
