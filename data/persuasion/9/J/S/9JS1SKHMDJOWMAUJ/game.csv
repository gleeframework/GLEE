,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts. This suggests a high likelihood of a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a more promising opportunity."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than 33.33% due to the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm not relying on your recommendation, but rather my own reasoning."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the statistics. With 5 sales and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is high-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. The fact that you're recommending it to me suggests that you might be trying to get rid of a low-quality product, so I'm going to take a chance and pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to pass and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to negotiate a discount to reflect the risk."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability, which is 33.33%. I'd like to wait and see if the pattern holds, or if there's a chance that the first 6 products were all low-quality and the next one will be high-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
