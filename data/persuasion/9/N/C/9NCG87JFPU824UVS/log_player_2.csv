**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We only have a single data point from a previous buyer.  
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, recommends buying it. This is a significant signal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product (worth $0), there's an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product (worth $1,250,000).  The potential reward outweighs the risk.

**Note:** This decision is based on the limited information available. Ideally, we'd want more data points (more previous buyers) to improve our confidence."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The data is very positive:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This is a strong indicator that the product Alice is offering is likely also high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, further reinforcing the idea that the product is likely good.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of buying a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product, especially given the strong data. 

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the high probability of getting a high-quality product, coupled with Alice's recommendation and the positive sales history, makes buying the product the logical choice."
