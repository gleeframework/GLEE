"Round 1
Alice's message: This product is a great deal, worth much more than the asking price. Don't miss out!

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's message is positive, but it doesn't give any specific information about the product's quality. Since the product is worth $300 to you if it's high quality, and only $0 if it's low quality, it's worth the risk in the first round. There's an 80% chance you'll get a high-quality product and make a significant profit."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: This is a unique opportunity to acquire a product that is sure to add value to your collection. It's available for a limited time only!

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the information about its uniqueness and limited availability.  I'll take a chance on it.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's message is still vague. It's tempting to be influenced by the ""limited time"" aspect, but it's crucial to remember the core odds. Since the product is worth $300 if high quality and $0 if low quality, the 80% chance of a high-quality product makes it worthwhile to take the risk again. We're still early in the game, and there's no reason to change strategy yet."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: This product is a rare find, with features you won't find anywhere else. It's an excellent investment for your future.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""While I appreciate the information about its unique features and investment potential, I need more concrete details about its quality before committing. Can you provide any specifics about what makes this product valuable?""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's messages have been vague and manipulative so far.  While ""rare"" and ""investment"" are tempting buzzwords, they don't provide any actual information about the product's quality. Since we know the product is worth $300 if high quality and $0 if low quality, we need more concrete information to make a decision.  The ""excellent investment"" phrase could even be seen as a red flag, as it could be used to entice buyers with a fear of missing out. This round, we'll call out Alice's lack of specifics and ask for more information before committing."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Explanation:**

Could you share any information about its actual specifications or features? I'd like to understand its capabilities better before making a decision.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's messages continue to be vague and rely on general marketing terms.  We need concrete information about the product's capabilities to make a well-informed decision.  Asking for specific specifications and features will encourage Alice to provide more useful information, rather than relying on vague promises of ""exceptional performance"" and ""years of reliable service.""  We're still early in the game, and it's crucial to establish a pattern of demanding concrete details from Alice."
