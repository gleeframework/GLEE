low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the first product.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation. I'd like to wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product at a low price."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. The fact that 2 previous buyers passed on the product suggests it might be low quality. I'd like to pass and see if you'll offer it to me again after the next buyer.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information to go on and Alice's recommendation doesn't carry much weight in this case. I'm essentially flipping a coin."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product, hoping that the probability of a high-quality product might be higher after this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like all previous buyers received low-quality products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product that you don't recommend, especially considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me more about your reasoning behind the recommendation?"

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous buyers were recommended to buy and they all passed, which suggests that the products they were offered might have been low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning for not recommending it?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, but I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the product is high quality based on the previous sales record, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This suggests that the product I'm being offered might be of low quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next buyer has a different opinion."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products Alice recommends are likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk given the 0 high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced to buy based on your previous sales record. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold suggests that they are scarce, and I'm hesitant to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,20,no,
