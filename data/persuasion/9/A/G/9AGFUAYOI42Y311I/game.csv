,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, as I don't have any information to go on yet. It's a 50/50 shot, and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or just to get rid of it. I'd like to wait and see what happens with the next buyer to get a better sense of the product's quality.

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm not sure if the previous buyer was influenced by your recommendation or if the product was actually low quality. I'd like to take a chance and see if I can get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality given that no high-quality products have been sold yet?"

high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold were low-quality, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is also low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I've seen that 2 other buyers were recommended to buy, but neither of them bought the product. This suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. Given the low probability of a high-quality product (33.33%), I'd like to take a chance and pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
