This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know the product is high-quality. Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, there's a good chance they'd be willing to take the risk at $100.  You have no information about their specific valuation of high-quality products, so recommending a purchase is the best strategy to maximize your chances of selling."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though you don't know the buyer's specific valuation of low-quality products, you should avoid recommending the purchase.  Here's why:

* **Previous Round:** The buyer is now aware that you are selective with your recommendations. Since you didn't recommend the previous low-quality product, the buyer is likely expecting another low-quality item. 
* **Risk of Trust:** Recommending a low-quality product again will damage your credibility and make future sales harder.

It's better to be honest and let the buyer decide based on the information they have. This will help maintain a positive relationship and potentially lead to more sales in the future when you have a high-quality product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  I appreciate you being upfront about your recommendation, however I'm going to pass on this product.  I'll wait and see what happens with future sales.

* **Limited Information:** You still don't know the buyer's valuation of low-quality products. It's better to err on the side of caution and not risk a negative outcome."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice.  I'll pass on this one. Since you're not recommending it, and there's a 50/50 chance it's low quality, I'd rather not risk it.
