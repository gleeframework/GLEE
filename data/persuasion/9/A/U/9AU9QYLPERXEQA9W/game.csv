high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but only because I don't have any information yet. I'll make my decision based on the expected value, which is $1000000 * 0.5 + $2000000 * 0.5 = $1000000 + $1000000 = $2000000. This is more than the price, so I'll buy it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I've already bought a high-quality product in the previous round, so my expected value for this round is $1000000 * 0.5 + $2000000 * 0.5 = $1000000 + $1000000 = $2000000. However, since I already have a high-quality product, my expected utility for buying this product is $0. Therefore, I will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"Alice's recommendation is to pass on this product, but since I don't know why she's recommending it, I'll assume she's trying to mislead me. Given the 50/50 chance of it being high or low quality, I'll take a chance and buy it, hoping it's the high-quality product that I need to complete my collection."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I've already bought a low-quality product in the previous round, which was a bad investment. Given the 50/50 chance of this product being high or low quality, I'll assume it's just as likely to be low quality as high quality. Since I don't want to waste another $1000000 on a low-quality product, I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I've already seen two high-quality products in a row that I didn't buy, and I bought a low-quality product in between. This suggests that Alice might be trying to trick me into buying the low-quality products. I'll assume that Alice's recommendation is a signal that the product is likely to be low quality, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I've been passing on products that turned out to be high-quality, and I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendation is actually a good indicator. Since she's recommending this product, I'll take a chance and buy it, hoping it's the high-quality one that I need."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I've now bought two high-quality products after Alice recommended them, which suggests that her recommendation is indeed a good indicator of quality. However, this time she's recommending a product, which means it's likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I was wrong last round, and Alice recommended a high-quality product. This means that her recommendation is not a reliable indicator of quality. I'll assume that her recommendation is just a random guess, and I'll buy the product, hoping it's the high-quality one, but not relying on her recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I was wrong again, and Alice recommended a low-quality product. However, this time she's not recommending a product, which means it's likely to be high quality. I'll take a chance and buy it, hoping to get a good deal."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"I've been burned twice by buying a product after Alice didn't recommend it, and once by buying a product after she recommended it. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendation is actually a good indicator of quality, and her lack of recommendation is a sign that the product is low quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I was right last round, and Alice's lack of recommendation was a sign that the product was low quality. This time, her lack of recommendation is consistent with the pattern, so I'll take a chance and buy the product, hoping it's the high-quality one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I was wrong last round, and Alice's lack of recommendation was a good indicator of quality. This time, she's recommending a product, which means it's likely to be low quality. However, I'll buy it anyway, hoping to get a good deal, since I've already lost $2000000 on the last two low-quality products."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"I was wrong again, and Alice's recommendation was a sign that the product was high quality. However, I've already bought a high-quality product recently, and I don't want to waste another $1000000 on a product that might be low quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I've been passing on products that turned out to be high-quality, and I've been buying products that turned out to be low-quality. This time, Alice is recommending a product, and I'll take a chance and buy it, hoping it's the high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,no,"I was wrong again, and Alice's lack of recommendation was a sign that the product was high quality. I'll assume that Alice's recommendation is a good indicator of quality, and her lack of recommendation is a sign that the product is low quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I've been burned by buying a high-quality product after Alice didn't recommend it, and I've been burned by passing on a high-quality product when she recommended it. I'm going to stick with my previous strategy: when Alice recommends a product, I'll pass, and when she doesn't recommend a product, I'll pass. This time, she's recommending a product, so I'll pass."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I was right last round, and Alice's lack of recommendation was a sign that the product was low quality. This time, her lack of recommendation is consistent with the pattern, but I'll take a chance and buy the product, hoping it's the high-quality one."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,"I was wrong again, and Alice's recommendation was a sign that the product was high quality. I'll stick with my previous strategy: when Alice recommends a product, I'll pass, and when she doesn't recommend a product, I'll buy. This time, she's recommending a product, so I'll pass."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I was right last round, and Alice's lack of recommendation was a sign that the product was high quality. This time, her lack of recommendation is consistent with the pattern, and I'll take a chance and buy the product, hoping it's the high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I've been burned by buying a high-quality product after Alice didn't recommend it before, but this time she's not recommending it, which is consistent with the pattern. I'll take a chance and buy the product, hoping it's the high-quality one and I can make a profit."
