,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a premium product that I'm confident you'll love. It's a one-time opportunity to acquire a high-quality item for a steal at $100. You won't find a deal like this anywhere else, and I'm willing to make a special exception for you. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not sure if I want to take the risk of buying a product at $100 when it has a 50% chance of being worthless to me. Can you tell me more about the product and why you're so confident it's high-quality?,no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your caution. Let me put it this way: if I were you, I'd be willing to pay $300 for this product, and I'm offering it to you for a fraction of that price. I'm not just confident it's high-quality, I'm willing to put my reputation on the line. I've sold many high-quality products to satisfied customers in the past, and I'm confident this one is no exception. I'm offering you a 66% discount off the true value, and I'm willing to provide a full refund if it's not what you expected. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the discount and the guarantee, but I still think I'm taking a risk by paying $100 for a product that has a 50% chance of being worthless to me. I'd need a much higher discount or more information about the product to feel comfortable making a purchase.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. Let me be upfront with you - this product is not one of my best offerings. It's a product that I've had in stock for a while, and I'm looking to clear some inventory. I'm willing to let it go for $100, but I want to be transparent with you - it's not worth the full $300 that I usually charge for my high-quality products. If you're looking to take a chance on a product that might not be worth much to you, this could be a good opportunity. However, if you're looking for a product that's going to provide significant value, I'd recommend waiting for the next round.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not looking to take a chance on a product that might not be worth much to me. I'd rather wait for the next round and see if I can get a better deal on a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your decision to wait for a high-quality product. I'm glad you're being cautious. Let me offer you a special deal on this high-quality product: I'll throw in a 10-year warranty, which is a $100 value, absolutely free. This way, you'll have complete peace of mind and protection in case anything goes wrong. The product is still worth $300 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I think this is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at an unbeatable price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the offer, but the warranty is not enough to change my decision. I'm still concerned about the 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, and I don't want to pay $100 for a product that might be worth $0 to me. I'd like to wait for more information or a different offer.",no

I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a 50% refund if the product is not worth at least $200 to you.
