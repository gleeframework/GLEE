"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As a seller, your goal is to maximize your profit. Since you know this product is high-quality, you should recommend Bob to buy it. While you don't know the exact value of a high-quality product to Bob, there's a 50% chance it's worth more than $100 to him. Therefore, recommending the purchase has a good chance of resulting in a sale."

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob bought the first product, we have no information about his valuation of high-quality products.  He might have just been lucky or willing to take a risk.

You should aim to maintain Bob's trust by only recommending products you know are high-quality. This will increase the likelihood of future sales."
