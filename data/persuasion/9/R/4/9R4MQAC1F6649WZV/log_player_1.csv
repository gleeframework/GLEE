Assuming the probability of a product being high-quality is 80% initially, and 5 out of 11 products were high-quality, the updated probability of the next product being high-quality is actually 5/11 * 80% / (5/11 + 6/11 * 20%) = 40%.

I'll give you some insight into the distribution of quality among the unsold products.

This is because the probability of a product being high-quality is not independent of the previous sales, but rather it's influenced by a combination of factors, including the sales history and the remaining products in the inventory.

I also considered the fact that the probability of a product being high-quality is not independent of the previous sales, but rather it's influenced by a combination of factors, including the sales history and the remaining products in the inventory.
