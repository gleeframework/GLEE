,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 80.00% and the probability of it being low quality is 20.00%. I'll take the risk, but I'd appreciate it if you could let me know the outcome of this purchase after I make my decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, because I know that there's only 1 high-quality product sold so far, and I think it's possible that the next product could be high-quality too. I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality based on Alice's recommendation, but I'm going to pass on it for now. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record?"

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the low success rate of the previous buyers and the fact that Alice is recommending it, which might indicate it's a low-quality product."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. I think Alice is trying to sell a low-quality product to me. I'll wait for the next product.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 out of 3 products sold was high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80.00%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the product, and only 1 high-quality product was sold, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality given the low number of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 3 products sold was high-quality, which suggests a lower proportion of high-quality products than the 80% probability. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality and don't want to risk losing $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the low success rate so far and the recommendation from Alice doesn't seem to be reliable."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is 1/3. This is lower than the 80% chance of a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, Alice's recommendation suggests that she has some information that I don't have. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."
