,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous three buyers purchased the product, I'm inclined to think that the products they saw were likely low-quality. Since I have a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the previous products, and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have purchased products with no high-quality products sold, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and all of them passed, it's likely that the products they saw were low-quality.
