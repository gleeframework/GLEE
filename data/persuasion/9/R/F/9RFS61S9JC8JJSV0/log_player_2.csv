"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your recommendation. I'll pass on this one for now.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice is not recommending the product, it's likely she has a reason to believe it might be low quality. Even though there's a 80% chance of it being high quality, the potential loss of $1,000,000 if it's low quality outweighs the potential gain of $200,000 if it's high quality. It's best to pass on this one and see what the next round brings."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation, despite the 20% chance of it being low quality, gives us valuable information. Since she's recommending it, it suggests she has more confidence in this product's quality than the previous one.
