``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We only have a small sample size (one previous buyer). 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  While Alice doesn't know the true value of the product to us, her recommendation carries some weight. It suggests she believes the product is likely high quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($12,000) is significant, outweighing the risk of a low-quality product (losing $10,000). 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the limited information available.  In reality, with such a small sample size, there's a high chance of being misled by randomness."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Low Risk:** With only one high-quality product sold out of two, the odds are slightly in our favor.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the purchase, despite knowing the product's quality, adds to the positive signal. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Passing on the product means we get nothing, whereas buying has a chance of a $12,000 gain. 

While the odds are still against us, the risk is relatively low given the potential reward."
