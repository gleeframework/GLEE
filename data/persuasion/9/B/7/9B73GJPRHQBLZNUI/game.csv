high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm curious about the quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,I'm not going to fall for the same trick twice. I'll pass this time.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,I'll take the chance again. Maybe I'll get lucky and it's another high-quality product.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I've had two high-quality products in a row, which is unlikely. I'm starting to think the next one might be low-quality. I'll pass this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"Alice is recommending against this one, which makes me suspicious. I'll take a chance and buy it, hoping it's a low-quality product that I can get for a steal."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"I just lost $1000000 on a low-quality product, so I'm going to be more cautious. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I've had a 50/50 split so far, and I've been passing on the low-quality one. I'll take the chance and buy this one, hoping it's high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"I've had three high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely. I think Alice might be trying to manipulate me. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy this one, hoping to break the streak of high-quality products."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,Four high-quality products in a row is just too suspicious. I think Alice is trying to trick me. I'll pass this time.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I've had five high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely. I'm going to take a chance and buy this one, hoping it's a one-off anomaly."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,Six high-quality products in a row is statistically impossible. I'm convinced that Alice is manipulating me. I'll pass this time.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I've been passing on the last few products, but I'm starting to think that the probability of getting a low-quality product is still 20%. I'll take a chance and buy this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,Seven high-quality products in a row is absurd. I'm 100% sure that Alice is manipulating me. I'll pass this time.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm starting to think that the probability of getting a low-quality product is actually lower than 20%... or Alice is just really, really lucky. I'll take a chance and buy this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,Eight high-quality products in a row is completely implausible. I'm certain that Alice is manipulating the product quality or has some inside information. I'll pass this time.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'm starting to think that I'm in a Monty Hall problem situation, where the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually 80% because the previous ones were all high-quality. I'll take a chance and buy this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"Alice is recommending against this one, which makes me think it might be a low-quality product. I'll take a chance and buy it, hoping to break the streak of high-quality products."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"I just lost $1000000 on a low-quality product, and I've had 9 high-quality products in a row. I'm going to be cautious and pass this time."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"It's the final round, and I've had a 90% success rate on high-quality products. I'll take a chance and buy this one, hoping to end on a high note."
