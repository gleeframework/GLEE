"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a deal on a product for $10000. I know it's not the best quality, but I'm willing to let it go for this price. If you're not interested, I'll just have to find another buyer. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying the current product. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is like.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I told you the last one wasn't the best. This one is similar, and I'm still only asking $10000. If you're not willing to take a chance on it, I'll just have to move on. I'm not getting any younger, and I need to sell these products quickly.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not interested in buying the current product. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is like.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: Three strikes and you're out, right? Okay, fine. I'll let you in on a little secret: I've got a bunch of these low-quality products coming up, and I'm starting to get a little desperate. I'll give you a deal: I'll throw in a 'free' product with this one if you buy it now. It's not a high-quality product, but it's a product nonetheless. And I'll still only ask $10000 for this one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying the current product, even with the 'free' product thrown in. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is like.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: You're a tough negotiator, I like that. Alright, let me sweeten the deal. I'll give you a 100% guarantee: this product is the last low-quality product I have in stock. If you buy it now, I'll throw in not one, not two, but THREE 'free' products with it. And I'll still only ask $10000 for this one. It's a one-time offer, so what do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying the current product, even with the three 'free' products thrown in. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is like.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: Ah, finally! A high-quality product! I'm glad I could save the best for last. This one's a real gem, and I think you'll be impressed. I'm not going to try to lowball you or throw in any 'free' products. I'll just ask you straight out: is $10000 a fair price for a high-quality product like this?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Yes, I'd be happy to buy the current product for $10000. I'm willing to pay the fair price for a high-quality product.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: Well, congratulations on making a great decision earlier! You got a fantastic deal on that high-quality product. Now, I'm back to the usual stuff. Let's just say that this product... isn't quite as good as the last one you bought from me. But hey, it's still a product, right? And I'm only asking $10000 for it. Just like before.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying the current product. I'm not willing to take a chance on a low-quality product at the same price as the high-quality one I just bought.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm starting to think you're being a bit unfair. You got a great deal on the last high-quality product, and now you're expecting me to give you a discount on these low-quality ones? I'm not made of money, you know. I'm still only asking $10000 for this one, and I'm starting to think that's a generous offer.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to pay the same price for a low-quality product. I'm willing to wait and see what the next product is like.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: Ah, I see you're a shrewd negotiator, always looking for a good deal. Well, I'll give you one. I'll tell you that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price. I'll ask you $7500 for it. That's a 25% discount from the original price. Is that a deal you'd be willing to make?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying the current product at $7500. I'm willing to wait and see what the next product is like.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: You're a tough customer, I like that. Alright, let me think for a moment... I've got a better idea. I'll not only meet you halfway on the price, but I'll also throw in a special bonus: I'll give you a 10% discount on your next purchase, regardless of the product's quality. So, if you buy this high-quality product at $7500, you'll get a 10% discount on the next one. That's a deal you can't pass up, right?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take the deal. I'll buy the high-quality product at $7500 and take advantage of the 10% discount on the next one.""}"

Round 10
Alice's message: Great, glad we could come to an agreement! Now, let's get down to business. I know you're not thrilled about the next product, but I'll make you a deal. Since you're a valued customer now, I'll give you a special 'customer appreciation' discount. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $5000. That's a 50% discount from the original price. It's a one-time offer, so what do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying the current product at $5000. I'm not willing to pay that much for a low-quality product.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice's message: You're a savvy shopper, I'll give you that. Alright, I'll try a different approach. I'll tell you that I've been in the business a long time, and I've got a reputation to uphold. I'm not going to sell you a low-quality product for a high price. I'll sell it to you for $2500, and that's as low as I can go. It's a steal, if I do say so myself.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying the current product at $2500. I'm not willing to pay that much for a low-quality product.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying the current product, even if it's free. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is like.""}"

Round 13

Round 14
Alice's message: I'm starting to think you're just trolling me at this point. Fine. I'll stop trying to sell you on the low-quality products. This one, however, is a real gem. I'll give you a deal that's even better than before: I'll sell it to you for $7500, and I'll throw in a 20% discount on your next purchase. That's a total of 40% off the original price. You'd be crazy to pass this up.

Round 16
