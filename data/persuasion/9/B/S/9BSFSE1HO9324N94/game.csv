high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2 purchases, I'm a bit concerned that the product might be low quality. However, I'm also considering the fact that the probability of a product being high quality is 80.00%. I'll take the plunge and buy it."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the probability of it being low-quality, given the statistics. I'm not basing my decision solely on Alice's recommendation."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 3/4 = 0.75. However, I know that the true proportion should be 0.8. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm suspicious that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,20,yes,
