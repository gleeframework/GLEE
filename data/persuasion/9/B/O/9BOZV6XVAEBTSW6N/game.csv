high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the low number of sales and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products, given that all previous recommendations were made after the product's quality was revealed. I'd like to wait and observe more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it suggests that the products sold so far were all low-quality.

I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the fact that 3 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like the products being offered are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
