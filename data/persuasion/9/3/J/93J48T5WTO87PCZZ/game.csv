,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I think there's a high chance this product is low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products since all previous buyers bought the products after her recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, as the potential reward of getting a high-quality product is worth it to me."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and the price is $1000000, which is a significant discount from the value of a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I suspect that the current product is also low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the statistics, all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products.

Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the current product is also low-quality. I will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.
