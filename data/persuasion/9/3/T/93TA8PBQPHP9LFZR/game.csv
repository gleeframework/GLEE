low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate your recommendation being based on the probability of the product being high-quality, rather than a personal opinion."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, I think it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, and I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather wait for more information or a different recommendation."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far. I'm trying to make an informed decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products. I'd like to know the updated statistics after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers have passed on the product despite Alice's recommendation, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, this seems consistent with my expectations. I'd like to wait for a product that has a higher chance of being high-quality based on the updated statistics."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers bought the product after your recommendation, I'm going to assume that all of them received low-quality products. This would imply that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/4, which is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. I'm going to update my prior probability of the product being high-quality to 25% and low-quality to 75%. Given this updated probability, I'm not confident enough to buy the product."

,,Alice,14,no,

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product, since the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
