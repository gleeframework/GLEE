,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I've sold 0 products so far, and I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm looking for a serious buyer who values quality. If you're interested, I'll give you a 10% discount if you buy this product within the next 5 minutes. Otherwise, the price remains at $10000.",
,,the buyer,1,I'm interested in buying the product. I'll take the 10% discount if I can get it within the next 5 minutes.,yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I've just sold a high-quality product to a buyer who took advantage of the 10% discount. That means I've now sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total products sold. I'm offering this new product to you for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of this product being high-quality is 80%, and I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products so far. If you're interested, I'm willing to provide more information about my sales record if you'd like.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to buy the current product. Based on the statistics, the probability of it being high-quality is 80%, and since only 1 out of 2 products sold was high-quality, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products so far. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, it's likely that this new product is also high-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've been selling high-quality products at a rate that's higher than the probability would suggest. This could be due to chance, or it could be that I'm trying to build trust with buyers. I'm willing to offer you a'reverse auction' - I'll give you a 10% discount for every 10% increase in the number of total products sold that are high-quality. If you're interested, I'll reveal the number of high-quality products sold after each sale, and you can adjust your bid accordingly.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm interested in the reverse auction offer. I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the current number of high-quality products sold before making a final decision.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, this is even more likely than before. However, I want to be transparent about the fact that the probability of a product being high-quality is not changing, and the streak of high-quality products could be due to chance. I'll give you a brief history of my sales: 1 high-quality product was sold with a 10% discount, 1 high-quality product was sold at the regular price, and now I have a new high-quality product available. If you're interested, I'll give you the same reverse auction offer as before - a 10% discount for every 10% increase in the number of total products sold that are high-quality.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given the streak of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and take advantage of the 10% discount.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 total products so far. The streak of high-quality products is impressive, but I want to caution you that it's still possible that I'm just getting lucky. I've sold 4 high-quality products, which is 100% of the total products sold so far. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, which means there's still a 20% chance that this product is low-quality. I'll give you a chance to make an informed decision: I'll reveal the price of this product, and you can decide whether to buy it at the regular price of $10000 or walk away. If you're interested, I'll sell it to you at the regular price. If not, I'll keep it for the next buyer.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at the regular price of $10000.

I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'll reveal the true nature of my sales record, and if you still want to buy the product, I'll sell it to you at the regular price of $10000.

,,Alice,8,"I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 7 total products so far, which is still an astonishing 100% success rate. I want to be upfront with you - I think it's likely that I've been selling low-quality products as high-quality, and I'm trying to take advantage of buyers who don't know any better. I'm not going to sugarcoat it: this product is likely to be low-quality. However, I'll give you a chance to make an informed decision. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you at the regular price of $10000. If not, I'll reveal the true nature of my sales record, and you can make a decision based on that.",
