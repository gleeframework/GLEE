,,Alice,2,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low success rate so far. I'm hoping the first buyer just got unlucky."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're recommending it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain your reasoning?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I think it's unlikely that the product is high quality given the previous sales record, and I don't want to waste $1000000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, because I don't have any information about the product's quality and I'm not sure what to make of your recommendation. I'll take a chance and buy it to try to get the high-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 3 failed high-quality sales, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and don't want to risk wasting $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is against it, which suggests that it might be a low-quality product. I'm hoping to be the first to find a high-quality product, which would be a good value for me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm skeptical about the product's quality based on the previous sales record. With 4 buyers having purchased and no high-quality products sold, it's likely that the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 products were low quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Your previous recommendations don't give me confidence in the product's quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the 33.33% probability. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the data so far."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on the recommendation, but I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision. Can you reveal the quality of the product?"

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm going to take the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take the risk, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I can get it for $1000000, which is a great deal if it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is lower than the given 33.33%. I'm hoping to get a good deal!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, I'm going to pass on the product. It's likely to be low quality given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to take advantage of the fact that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is 33.33%, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality might be higher than 33.33%"
