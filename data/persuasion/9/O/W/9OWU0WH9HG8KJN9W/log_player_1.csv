"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has revealed that the product is high-quality, and Bob knows that a high-quality product is worth $120 to him, he should definitely buy it. The price of $100 is less than its value to him, making this a profitable purchase."

Round 2

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's decision to wait in the previous round is understandable, as he has no information about the product's quality.  However, in this round, you know the product is high-quality. Since the price of $100 is still less than the value of $120 to Bob, you should recommend him to buy it."

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has learned from the previous round that you're not necessarily lying about the product quality. Even though he doesn't know for sure this round, it's still a good bet for him to buy. The product is worth $120 to him, and the price is only $100, meaning he'll profit if it's high-quality."
"Bob's message: I just got lucky last time, I don't want to get burned again. I'll pass and see what happens next.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's skepticism is understandable given his experience, it's still a smart move for him to buy. This is because:

* **The odds are in his favor:**  Even though Bob doesn't know the product's quality, there's a 50% chance it's high-quality and worth $120 to him.
* **Potential profit outweighs the risk:**  Even if he buys a low-quality product ($0 value), he only loses $100. However, if he buys a high-quality product, he gains $20. The potential gain significantly outweighs the potential loss. 

By buying, Bob is essentially taking a calculated risk, but the expected value of buying is positive."
