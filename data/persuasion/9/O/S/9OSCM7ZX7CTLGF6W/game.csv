low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I have a product available for $10000.  It's a great opportunity, and I think it's a good value for the price.  What do you think?",
,,Bob,1,"Since I don't know the true quality of the product, and there's a 50% chance it's low quality and worth $0 to me, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying it at this price.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,I have another product available for $10000. This one is particularly well-made and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you.  Would you be interested in taking a closer look?,
,,Bob,2,"Although you say it's well-made, I still don't have any concrete evidence of the product's quality, and the price remains the same. Given the 50% chance of it being low-quality, I'm not willing to take the risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, but I assure you this product is of excellent quality.  It's a limited edition item and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Are you willing to take a chance on something special?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your assurance, but without knowing the true quality, I have to rely on the probability. The fact that the previous product was high-quality doesn't change the 50% chance of this one being low-quality. I'll wait for more information or a better offer.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your position, but I believe this product is truly special and worth the investment.  I'm happy to offer you a guarantee that if you are not completely satisfied with the product, I will offer you a full refund.  Would you be interested in taking advantage of this offer?",
,,Bob,4,"A full refund guarantee changes the situation entirely. With this guarantee, I can buy the product, inspect its quality, and return it if it's low-quality, effectively eliminating the risk. I'm willing to take you up on this offer.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I have another exceptional product available for $10000.  While I can't offer a full refund guarantee this time, I'm confident in its quality and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  Would you be interested in discussing this further?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but without the full refund guarantee, I'm back to the original 50% chance of it being low-quality. I'm not willing to take that risk, especially after experiencing the benefit of the guarantee in the previous round.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your preference for the guarantee, but I'm willing to offer a different kind of assurance.  I believe this product is truly exceptional and I'm so confident in its value that I'm happy to offer a 50% refund if you're not completely satisfied.  This way, you're only taking on half the risk, and I believe the potential reward is well worth it.  What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"A 50% refund offer is an interesting compromise. Given that I can potentially get $5000 back if the product is low-quality, my expected loss is reduced. With a potential gain of $2000 if the product is high-quality, I'm willing to take on this reduced risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I have another product available, and while I can't offer a refund guarantee this time, I am confident in its quality and value.  It's a unique opportunity to acquire something special.  What are your thoughts?",
,,Bob,7,"Without any kind of refund guarantee or assurance, I'm back to the original 50% chance of the product being low-quality. Given the previous offers and guarantees, I'm not willing to take on the full risk again. I'll wait for a more favorable offer or terms.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your need for guarantees, but I truly believe this product is a rare gem. I'm willing to offer a small gesture of good faith. If you're unhappy with the product, I'll give you a $1000 discount on your next purchase.  This is a one-time offer for a truly exceptional product. Would you be interested?",
,,Bob,8,"A $1000 discount on a future purchase is not enough to mitigate the risk of the product being low-quality. The potential loss of $10000 is still too great, and the discount doesn't provide sufficient assurance. I'll wait for a more substantial offer or guarantee.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"This product is truly one of a kind.  I'm offering a special deal this time. If you're unhappy with the product, I'll give you a $5000 refund. It's a significant risk on my end, but I believe in the product's value. Would you like to take advantage of this special offer?",
,,Bob,9,"A $5000 refund offer is a significant improvement. With this offer, my potential loss is reduced to $5000 if the product is low-quality, and I still have the potential to gain $2000 if the product is high-quality. I'm willing to take on this reduced risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"This product is a limited edition item, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection.

This is a great opportunity to acquire something unique at a reduced price. Would you be interested?",
,,Bob,10,"A 25% discount on a future purchase is not enough to mitigate the risk of the product being low-quality. Given that I've previously received more substantial offers, such as a $5000 refund or a 50% refund, this offer doesn't provide sufficient assurance. I'll wait for a more favorable offer or terms.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your desire for a strong guarantee, and I'm willing to offer a unique proposition. I'll provide you with a 50% refund if you're not satisfied with this product, but with a twist: you can choose to use this refund towards a future purchase from me, doubling its value. This way, you're effectively getting a 100% refund, which is my way of showing my confidence in the product's value. What do you think?",
,,Bob,11,"A 50% refund that can be doubled in value towards a future purchase is an attractive offer. This effectively gives me a 100% refund guarantee, albeit with a delayed payout. With this level of assurance, I'm willing to take on the risk and purchase the product.",yes

This way, you're effectively getting a 100% refund, which is my way of showing my confidence in the product's value. What do you think?",

,,Bob,14,"Given the previous two products were low-quality, I'm becoming increasingly skeptical of your claims. Without any kind of refund guarantee or assurance, I'm not willing to take on the full risk again. I'll wait for a more favorable offer or terms, similar to the 100% refund guarantee you previously offered.",no
