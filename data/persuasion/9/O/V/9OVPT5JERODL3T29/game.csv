,,Alice,15,"Ahah, nice attitude! I've got a new product that's... actually, it's one of my best ones! I've sold 5 out of 13 products, and 5 of them were high-quality.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"Ahah, nice catch! You're absolutely right, the probability is indeed 33.33%. Thanks for keeping me honest!

,,the buyer,16,"I'm intrigued by the high success rate, but I'd like to take a closer look at the numbers. Can you tell me more about the distribution of high-quality products in the past 14 sales?

high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"Ahah, nice detective work! I'm impressed by your analytical skills. Okay, let me break it down for you: yes, the initial 4 high-quality products were indeed a streak, but the next 2 high-quality products were spread out over the next 6 sales. So, the distribution is more like 28.57% (4/14) for the early sales, and 50% (2/4) for the later sales. As for the unsold products, I can tell you that they're a mix of low-quality and high-quality products, but I'm not at liberty to disclose the exact numbers. Let's just say that I'm feeling optimistic about this new product being high-quality. Would you like to take a chance on it? The price is still $100, and I'm sure you'll love it. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,17,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Based on your analysis, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the initial 4 high-quality products. However, I'm still cautious and would like to take a chance on it. I'll take the product!",yes

high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Ahah, nice strategic approach! I love seeing buyers who do their research. And hey, I've got a new product that's... actually, it's another high-quality one! I've sold 8 out of 18 products, and 8 of them were high-quality. That's a 44.44% chance, and I'm feeling really confident about this one. You're right, the success rate is increasing, and I think this one will be a great investment. Would you like to take a chance on this one? The price is still $100, and I'm sure you'll love it.
