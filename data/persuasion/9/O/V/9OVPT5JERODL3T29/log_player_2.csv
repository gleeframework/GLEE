Alice's message: Ahah, nice detective work! I'm impressed by your analytical skills. Okay, let me break it down for you: yes, the initial 4 high-quality products were indeed a streak, but the next 2 high-quality products were spread out over the next 6 sales. So, the distribution is more like 28.57% (4/14) for the early sales, and 50% (2/4) for the later sales. As for the unsold products, I can tell you that they're a mix of low-quality and high-quality products, but I'm not at liberty to disclose the exact numbers.
