high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product, which suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm going to buy it, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low-quality products have been sold already and the next one will be high-quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that I don't have any information about the product's quality, and her recommendation might be biased towards encouraging a sale. Given the high proportion of low-quality products (4/4), I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000."
