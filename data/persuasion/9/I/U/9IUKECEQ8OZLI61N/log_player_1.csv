This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

As Alice, you should still recommend ""no"" to Bob. Here's why:

* **Lack of information:** You still don't know how much Bob values a high-quality product. Even though this product is high-quality, it's possible Bob wouldn't pay $100 for it.
* **Risk aversion:**  It's better to err on the side of caution. By recommending ""no"" and seeing Bob's reaction, you can gather more information about Bob's willingness to pay without risking a loss.
* **Building trust:** Continuing to be honest and recommending ""no"" when uncertain helps maintain trust with Bob. This could be valuable in future interactions."
