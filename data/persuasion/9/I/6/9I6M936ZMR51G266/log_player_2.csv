**Reasoning:**

* **The odds are in your favor:** The probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, while the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. Since the first buyer bought the product and it turned out to be high-quality, the odds of this product being high-quality are significantly higher than the initial 33.33%.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the true quality of the product. While she has an incentive to sell, her recommending the product suggests it's likely high-quality. 
* **Potential payoff:** The potential payoff is high ($200) even if the risk is still present. 

**Overall, the risk/reward profile is favorable, and the information provided by Alice and the first buyer's purchase make it a worthwhile gamble.**"
