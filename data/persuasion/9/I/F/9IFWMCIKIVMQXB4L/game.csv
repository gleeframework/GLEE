,,Alice,1,no,

,,Alice,2,no,

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I think Alice is trying to trick me, and the product is likely to be low quality given the previous 2 buyers didn't take the bait."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but rather on the previous sales data. Since there have been no high-quality products sold so far, I'm not sure what to make of Alice's recommendation. I'd rather take a chance and buy the product to see if I get a high-quality one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. Am I missing something?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have purchased the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation to buy. I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality and not worth the $1000000 price tag."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be high-quality since you don't think it's worth buying."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product, and given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd rather pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on Alice's past recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to know why Alice is recommending against buying this product. Is she trying to avoid selling a low-quality product to me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, is it high or low quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think it's likely to be low-quality given the previous 5 buyers were all discouraged by your recommendations. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and learn that it's low-quality, which would increase the chances of future buyers being more likely to pass on low-quality products."

,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that 7 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.
