If you buy this one and it's low-quality, it will be the second consecutive low-quality product. Given the probability of the product being high-quality, I'm willing to offer you a 'double or nothing' deal. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you the next product for free.

Given that this is the third high-quality product, I'm starting to think that my initial 50% confidence in the product's quality might be a bit low. I'm willing to offer you a'reverse auction' deal. I'll start with a price of $750000, and you can make a counteroffer. If your counteroffer is higher than $750000, I'll accept it if the product is high-quality.
