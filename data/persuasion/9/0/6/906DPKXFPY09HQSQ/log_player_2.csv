**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation carries weight, as she knows the true quality of the product.
* **Previous Sales Data:** All 4 previous buyers purchased products that turned out to be high quality. This strongly suggests Alice is being truthful with her recommendations and likely offering a high-quality product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even though there's a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($30,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).

**Conclusion:** It's a calculated risk, but the available information strongly suggests buying the product."
