,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she has sold 1 high-quality product out of 4, which is a 25% success rate. This is lower than the expected 50% success rate, so I'm inclined to think that the next product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."
