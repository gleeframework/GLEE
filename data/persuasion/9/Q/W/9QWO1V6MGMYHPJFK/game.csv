,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. I'm starting to realize that my previous guarantee might not be as valuable as I thought.

I'm going to be upfront with you: I'm not as confident in this product as I should be. The price is still $10000, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. What do you think?",
