I'm offering this one to you for $1000000, but I'll be honest with you - I'm getting a bit nervous about the quality of this one. It's still a risk, but I'm hoping you'll take it off my hands.",

I'm starting to think I might be selling at a disadvantage. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000, but I'm not making any promises about its quality. I'm actually considering offering a discount, but I want to see how you react to this information first. Will you take the risk at the full price, or would you be willing to consider a lower price?",
