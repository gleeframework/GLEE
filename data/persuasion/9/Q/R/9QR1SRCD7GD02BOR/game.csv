low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there's a 33.33% chance it's high quality and I'm willing to take that risk."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my own judgment, not Alice's recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the probability of the product being high or low quality."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. How many potential buyers have there been and how many products were sold?
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely lower than expected. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and all of them passed, it suggests that the products they were offered were likely low-quality. Since I have a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk and wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'm also not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product without more information. Can you tell me more about the previous sales and the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers passed on the product suggests that they thought it was low quality, and given the probability of the product being high quality is 33.33%, I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain why you think this product is not worth buying?"

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, but I'm willing to take the risk given the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation has no bearing on my decision. I'm making this purchase based on the fact that 5 out of 5 buyers have passed on the product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the 33.33% probability. I'm taking a chance and hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers bought the product despite the lack of high-quality products sold, it's likely that the products being sold are low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
