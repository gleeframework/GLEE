,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I've lost $70000 on the last seven products, but I'm starting to question my strategy. I'm buying every product that Alice doesn't recommend, but I've only seen one high-quality product so far.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I've learned my lesson from the last few rounds. Since Alice recommends this product, I'm going to pass. She only recommends the low-quality products, so I'll wait for her to not recommend one."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"I've had two consecutive high-quality products that Alice recommended, but now she's not recommending this one. I'm going to stick with my new strategy of only buying when she recommends a product."
