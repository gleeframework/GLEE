Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Since Bob didn't buy the low-quality product, I can infer that he values the low-quality product at less than $10000. This is because he chose not to buy it, and the price is non-refundable.

Now, I have a high-quality product, which is worth more than $10000 to Bob. I will recommend the high-quality product to Bob, as I know it's worth more to him than the price.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Since Bob bought the high-quality product in the previous round, I can infer that he values high-quality products at more than $10000. This is because he chose to buy it, and the price is non-refundable.

Now, I have a low-quality product, which is likely worth less than $10000 to Bob. Given that he was willing to take a risk and buy the high-quality product, I can assume that he is risk-averse and would rather not take a risk on a low-quality product.

Given this new information, I can infer that Bob's valuation of a product is heavily influenced by my recommendation. If I recommend a product, he is likely to buy it, regardless of its quality.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","This is a paradoxical situation. I recommended a low-quality product in the previous round, and Bob bought it despite it being low-quality.

Given this new information, I can infer that Bob's valuation of a product is heavily influenced by my recommendation, and he is willing to take a risk on low-quality products when I recommend them.

However, I also know that Bob values high-quality products at more than $10000, and he is willing to take a risk on low-quality products when I recommend them. This suggests that he values my recommendation more than the quality of the product.

In this case, I will recommend the low-quality product to Bob, hoping that he will buy it based on my recommendation.

However, I also know that Bob values high-quality products at more than $10000, and I have a high-quality product now. Since he didn't buy the previous high-quality product, I will recommend this one to him, hoping that he will buy it based on its quality.
