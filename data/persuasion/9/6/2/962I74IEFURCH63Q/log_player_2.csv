Alice's message: I understand your concerns and questions. Based on the expected 80% chance of a product being high-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 80%. As for the expected value of buying a product from me, I'd like to calculate it for you. Since I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 12 total sales, and 3 low-quality products out of 12 total products available, the expected value of buying a product from me is (4/12) * $30000 + (3/12) * $0 = $10000. This means that, on average, you can expect to pay $10000 for a product, which is exactly the price I'm offering. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $10000.
