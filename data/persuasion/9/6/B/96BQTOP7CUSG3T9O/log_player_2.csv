Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. Let me approach this from a different angle.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I want to offer you a different perspective. Even if I were just selling randomly, the law of large numbers suggests that the ratio of high-quality to total products would converge to the initial probability of 33.33% as the number of sales increases. However, my sales record shows a deviation from this probability, with 5 high-quality products out of 12 total. This suggests that I may have some insight or skill in selecting high-quality products.
