high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyer also bought it despite Alice's recommendation. This might indicate that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that she knows the product is of low quality, and she's trying to manipulate me into buying it. Given the statistics, it seems like all the products sold so far have been low quality, which makes me skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd rather wait for more information or a different recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and didn't purchase, it suggests that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product. Is it because of the previous sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, and you're concerned that the product is likely to be low quality?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, and given the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I suspect that the product is more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already been offered the product and none of them purchased, I'm going to assume that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is higher than the overall average. If I buy the product, I'll be overpaying by $3000000 if it's low-quality. Given the seller's knowledge of my valuation, I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer will make a purchase."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to take a risk and assume that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to see the next product."
