I'm willing to make a special offer just for you: I'll sell it to you for $8000, which is a $2000 discount from the standard price. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal considering its value.",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the deal on the previous product! Now, let me ask you: given that you were willing to pay $8000 for a product that wasn't one of our best, I think you'll find that this high-quality product is well worth the full $10000. It's a premium item that will provide you with significant benefits and value. What do you say?",

However, I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that's even lower than the previous discount: $6000.
