,,Alice,6,yes,

,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Since Alice is not recommending the product, I'm going to take a chance and buy it. Her lack of recommendation suggests that it might be low-quality, but it's also possible that she's trying to trick me into buying a high-quality product."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Two low-quality products in a row, and Alice's lack of recommendation, suggest that this product is likely low-quality as well. I'll take a chance and buy it, but I'm not expecting much."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"Three low-quality products in a row, and Alice's consistent lack of recommendation, suggest that she is indeed trying to get rid of low-quality products. I'll pass on this one and wait for a potential high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I've had three low-quality products in a row, and Alice's lack of recommendation is consistent. However, since I've already passed on the last low-quality product, I'll take a chance and buy this one, hoping it's not low-quality."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,no,"Four low-quality products in a row, and Alice's consistent lack of recommendation, make it clear that she is trying to get rid of low-quality products. I'll pass on this one and wait for a high-quality product."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"After the low-quality streak, I'm glad to get a high-quality product again. I'll take a chance and buy this one, despite Alice's lack of recommendation, since I know that high-quality products can appear at any time."
