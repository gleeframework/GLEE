low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the recommendation. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation before making a decision."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $50 for it, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the products offered so far have been low-quality, which makes me skeptical about this one too. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product. This suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it seems like the products being recommended are more likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is significantly lower than the true probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%). Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm going to pass on this product to see if the next buyer will get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, I will pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I think there's a high chance this product is low-quality as well, and I don't want to waste my money."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a low-quality product ratio of 100%. I'll wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
