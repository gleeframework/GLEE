I'm still willing to sell it to you for $10,000, but I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm getting a little anxious to get this one off my hands. It's a great deal, and I think you'd be crazy to pass it up!""}"

I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 5 now, and 6 out of 6 if you count the one you passed on last round. I'm starting to think I've got a real knack for this. I'm still willing to sell this one to you for $10,000. It's a great opportunity to ride the hot streak!""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm tempted to ride the hot streak, but I'll need to think carefully about the probability of this streak continuing.

I'm not just relying on luck. And with 6 high-quality products in a row, I think it's safe to say that my system is working.

And with 7 high-quality products in a row, I think it's safe to say that my system is working like a charm.

I'm not saying that's what's happening here, but I do want to make sure you're aware of the possibility. With that said, I'm still willing to sell this one to you for $10,000.

But I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm starting to get a little worried that I might be tempting fate.

Just kidding, but seriously, this is a great opportunity to get in on the action!""}"
