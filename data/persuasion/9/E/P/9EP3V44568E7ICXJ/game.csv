,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer, and I'll buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality. I think the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $10000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see for myself if it's high or low quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the quality of the previous products to make a more informed decision in the future."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the previous sales record or something else?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy the product, but none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for a product that has not been recommended to be bought by a previous buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which might indicate a bias towards recommending low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that you've recommended against it and all previous buyers have also chosen not to buy, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'll wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you've recommended against it, I'm assuming it's likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product and hope it's high-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I suspect that the products sold so far were all low-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected, making it less likely that the current product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers, including the ones who received a recommendation from you, didn't end up buying a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to see more data or a different recommendation before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I believe the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I would like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can I see the statistics after this decision?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that if a high-quality product has been sold, it would have been sold by now, and since none have been sold, I'm inclined to think that all previous products were low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy it, I'm inclined to think that the product is low quality. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%. I'll pass on the product."
