**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she has access to the actual quality of the product, her recommendation is valuable.
* **Limited Data:** The data is very limited, but the fact that one high-quality product has been sold suggests that the odds are in our favor. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even with a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of $3,000,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000.  

**Important Note:** This is a simplified scenario. In a real-world situation, we would need more information and a deeper analysis to make a more informed decision."

**Reasoning:**

The data provided shows a 100% success rate for buyers who followed Alice's recommendations. Given the high chance of a product being high quality (80%) and the potential for a huge profit ($3,000,000), it's a very low-risk, high-reward situation.  Even if the product turns out to be low quality, the loss is minimal compared to the potential gain."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 16 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 16 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 17th buyer!
