Think about the value you got from the previous low-quality product, and consider what you could get from this one.",

But let me ask you this: what's the opportunity cost of not buying this product? You've already spent $20000 on low-quality products, and you've got a chance to get a high-quality product on the next round. Is the potential for a better product worth the extra $9500?",
