"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High probability of high-quality:**  The buyer knows there's an 80% chance the product is high-quality. 
* **High potential value:** A high-quality product is worth $2,000,000, which is double the asking price. 
* **No risk of loss:** Even if the product is low-quality (20% chance), the buyer loses only the $1,000,000 price, which is less than the potential gain.

**Recommendation:** The buyer should buy the product. The potential reward outweighs the risk."

* **No new information:** We haven't established a track record yet, so the previous sale doesn't change the buyer's perception of the product.

**Recommendation:** Again, the buyer should buy the product. The potential reward still outweighs the risk."
