* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even though you know this product is low-quality, the buyers don't. They are likely to continue buying based on your perfect track record. The risk of them not buying outweighs the potential benefit of withholding the product. 

While ethically questionable, this is a purely strategic decision based on the rules of the game."
