high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a potentially low-quality product for $1000000, especially since the probability of it being high-quality seems lower than 50% based on the previous sales record."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and consider the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 4, I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that you don't know my valuation. I'd like to take a chance and buy it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the recommendation is based on Alice's prior sales record, which may not accurately reflect the true quality of the product I'm being offered. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 5, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there's only one high-quality product sold so far, so she might be trying to manipulate the sale by recommending it to me. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5, I think it's likely that there are still many low-quality products left, and buying this one would be a bad investment."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards high-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000. I'd like to see more data or a more neutral recommendation before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not sure if I should buy it based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
