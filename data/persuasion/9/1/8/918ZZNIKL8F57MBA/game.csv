high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that all previous buyers passed on the products, so she's likely to recommend a product to the next buyer to increase the chances of selling it. Also, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the previous products might have been low-quality, making it more likely that this product is also low-quality."
