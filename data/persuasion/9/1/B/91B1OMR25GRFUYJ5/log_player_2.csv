**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on.  The only data point is that one buyer purchased a high-quality product. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a valuable signal.  While she doesn't know the value to us, she has some knowledge about the product's quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product ($12,000) is significant, outweighing the potential loss of $10,000 if it's low quality.

**It's a gamble, but with limited information, trusting Alice's recommendation is the best course of action.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  6 out of 8 buyers who followed Alice's recommendation received a high-quality product. This is a 75% success rate, significantly higher than the 50% chance of getting a high-quality product randomly. 
* **Potential Value:** Even if the product is low quality, the worst-case scenario is losing $10,000. However, there's a strong probability of getting a $12,000 product, resulting in a $2,000 profit.

**The recommendation from Alice, combined with the positive sales data, makes buying the product a favorable decision.**"

**Explanation:**

The statistics show a strong positive signal.  While there's always a risk with a 50/50 chance of a product being low-quality, the fact that 9 out of 13 buyers have purchased high-quality products makes it a good bet.  Alice's recommendation further strengthens this."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **The data is favorable:**  9 out of 15 products sold were high quality, which is a 60% success rate. This suggests a higher than random chance of getting a high-quality product.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which implies she believes the current product is more likely to be high quality based on her own information. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a 50% chance of it being low quality, the potential reward of $12,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.

This is a calculated risk, but the available information suggests a better than even chance of getting a high-quality product."
