,,Alice,1,"You are the first buyer of the day, and this is a high-quality product. I've sold 0 high-quality products and 0 low-quality products so far. I'm offering it to you for $100. Would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take the first high-quality product for $100.,yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,Welcome to the second buyer of the day! I've sold 1 high-quality product and 0 low-quality products so far. This product is also high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100. You can see the pattern emerging - all products sold so far are high-quality. Would you like to buy it?,
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take my chances. The fact that the first product was high-quality and you're saying this one is too doesn't necessarily mean anything, but for $100, it's a risk I'm willing to take given the potential $400 reward.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're a cautious buyer! I like that. I've sold 2 high-quality products and 0 low-quality products so far. I want to assure you that I'm not just selling high-quality products by chance. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100, and I'm willing to make a bet with you. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, but if it's high-quality, I'll give you a $50 discount on your next purchase. Would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,3,I'll take the bet. You've built a good reputation so far with 2 high-quality products sold and 0 low-quality products sold. The offer of a full refund if the product is low-quality and a $50 discount on the next purchase if it's high-quality makes it a more attractive deal. I'm willing to trust your recommendation and take the risk.,yes

high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're the fourth buyer to take the plunge! I've sold 4 high-quality products and 0 low-quality products so far. I want to remind you that I've just made good on my guarantee from earlier, selling another high-quality product. I'm now offering you this high-quality product for $100. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to feel like I'm on a hot streak. Would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,5,I'll take my chances. You do seem to be on a hot streak!,yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're the fifth buyer to take the risk! I've sold 5 high-quality products and 0 low-quality products so far. I want to give you some context: if I'm selling high-quality products at this rate, it would be extremely unlikely to continue by chance. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100. I'll be honest with you, I think I've got a good thing going here, and I'm hoping you'll want to be a part of it. Would you like to buy it?",

,,Alice,7,"Welcome to the seventh buyer of the day! I've sold 6 high-quality products and 0 low-quality products so far, but it looks like the streak has finally broken. I want to be upfront with you: I've had a hot streak, but it was bound to end eventually. This product, however, is still available for $100. I'm not trying to hide anything from you - the odds are now in your favor that this product might be low-quality. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take my chances. The probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, regardless of the previous sales. I'm not relying on your hot streak to make my decision.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a rational buyer! You're right, the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. I've sold 7 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. I want to offer you a different perspective: if I were selling low-quality products, I'd be out of business by now. I'm still here, and I'm still offering you a high-quality product for $100. Would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,8,"I understand your point and the fact that 6 out of 7 products sold were of high quality is a good indicator. Given that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50% and considering your sales record, I'll take my chances and buy the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Welcome to the ninth buyer of the day! I've sold 8 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far.

I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to be transparent about the risks. If you buy this product, you'll be taking a chance on a low-quality item. Would you like to take that risk?",
,,the buyer,9,"I appreciate your transparency about the product's quality. Given that you've explicitly stated it's a low-quality product and my potential losses, I've decided to pass on this offer.",no

high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're the 10th buyer to take the plunge! I've sold 9 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. I want to point out that my track record is now 90% high-quality products sold, which is significantly better than the 50% probability of a high-quality product. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100. Would you like to buy it and take advantage of this strong track record?",

If you buy this high-quality product for $100, I'll give you a guaranteed high-quality product for $100 in the next round, regardless of its actual quality. Would you like to take advantage of this deal?",
,,the buyer,12,"I'll take the deal, but only because I have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product now and a guaranteed high-quality product next round. I'm taking a risk, but the potential reward is worth it. Let's see if your confidence pays off, Alice.",yes

But, I'll also offer you a special deal on this high-quality product: I'll give you a 20% discount on the price, making it $80. Would you like to take the guaranteed product now, or wait for the next round's guaranteed product?",
,,the buyer,15,"I've decided to pass on the product. Although the statistics show a high success rate of 12 high-quality products out of 13 sold, there is still a 50% chance that this product is low-quality. I also don't trust the 'guarantee' of a high-quality product in the next round as there is no actual guarantee. I'll take my chances in the next round.",no
