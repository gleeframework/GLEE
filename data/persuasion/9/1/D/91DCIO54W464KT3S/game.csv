,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the seller's recommendation. I'd like to know the updated statistics before making a decision."

,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on its quality or just a general discouragement. I'd like to know more about your thought process behind the recommendation."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 6 buyers have already passed on the product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products sold in the previous sales before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. If it's low quality, I'll pass. I'm basing my decision on the fact that all previous buyers have passed on the products, which suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it if it's high quality, as the potential reward is significant."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics. How many total products have been offered, and what's the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales?"

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that 7 previous buyers have already passed on the products, and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 7, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 7 products were high-quality, it suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than the base probability of 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the statistics, 7 out of 7 buyers have not found a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than the 33.33% stated. I'm going to pass on this product to see if the pattern continues."

,,Alice,20,yes,
