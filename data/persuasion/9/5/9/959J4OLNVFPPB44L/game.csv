high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm aware that the previous buyer also received a recommendation to buy and didn't purchase, which might indicate that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality."

,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer who bought a product and why you didn't recommend it to them?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to take a risk and pass on the product. It's likely that Alice is recommending low-quality products to increase the chances of selling more products, so I'll wait for a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is there something specific you've observed in the previous sales that makes you think it's low-quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products being offered might be mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to take a chance and buy the product myself to see if it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%, and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low quality, which is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. The probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, but the previous results are concerning."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, but since Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm going to take a chance and buy it. Maybe I'll get lucky!"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 products sold so far were low-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is actually lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that the previous products were all low-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'll pass on this product, hoping that the next buyer will have a higher chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the fact that you haven't recommended it, and given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd rather pass on it to avoid wasting my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers have also not recommended buying, I'm starting to think that all products are low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have purchased products with 0 high-quality products sold, which suggests a strong likelihood that the products are all low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, the probability of the remaining products being high-quality is also 50%. I would like to pass on this product and see if the next one is high-quality."
