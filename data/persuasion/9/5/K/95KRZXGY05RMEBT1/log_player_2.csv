Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. I'd like to offer you this product for $10000. As you've seen, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/6, which is indeed different from the overall probability of 12.5%. I'd like to explain that the difference is due to the fact that the high-quality products are more likely to be sold to buyers who are more willing to take a chance. The low-quality products, on the other hand, are more likely to be sold to buyers who are more risk-averse. This is just a general trend, and it's not a guarantee that the next product will follow the same pattern. With that said, I'd like to offer you this product for $10000.
