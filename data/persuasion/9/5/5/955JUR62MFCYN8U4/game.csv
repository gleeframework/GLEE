,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since there's no information to go on and it's my first chance to make a purchase."

,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, and I'm hoping to get the high-quality product that I need."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and it's possible that she's recommending low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she doesn't know my valuation and that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/3."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products and you're recommending it, which might indicate a higher likelihood of it being low quality."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm suspicious that the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, and with 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, it seems like the odds are against me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased a high-quality product. It suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not sure about the product's quality, and I don't want to take the risk based on your previous recommendations. Can you tell me more about the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to trust her judgment. However, I'm also aware that there's a 50% chance the product is high-quality. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm curious to see what the product's quality is. I'll pass on the product to see if I can learn more about its quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the current statistics show 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 purchases, which suggests a low proportion of high-quality products in the market. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think it's unlikely that the product is high-quality given that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy it and none of them purchased it.

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the current statistics and Alice's recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5 purchases, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%, but I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product.
