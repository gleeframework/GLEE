low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,

However, I need to make a decision based on the probability of it being high quality. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll take the risk and buy it, but I'm doing so with a high degree of uncertainty."
