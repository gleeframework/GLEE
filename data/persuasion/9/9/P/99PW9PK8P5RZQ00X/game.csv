,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm not sure what the quality is, but I'm willing to take the risk since I'm the first buyer and I don't have any prior information to go on."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if the product is high quality and increase the chances of finding out the true quality of the products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous sales record, it seems like all previous products were low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she doesn't know the true quality of the product and is trying to maximize her sales. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't trust your recommendation. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite your warning."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious, what's the logic behind your recommendation?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, it seems like the products offered so far have been mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning for not recommending it? I've noticed that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which seems unusual given the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product being sold. I'm thinking that maybe the product is more likely to be high-quality than your recommendation suggests."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products is 0. Based on the probabilities, the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%. Given the recommendation from Alice, I'm suspicious that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to risk buying it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to buy it, based on your previous recommendations and the low sales of high-quality products, I'm not confident in the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is against it, which suggests there's a high chance it's low quality. I'm hoping to take advantage of the low price and the fact that it's been recommended against."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendation based on the statistics, but I'm not going to take the risk. Can you tell me more about your reasoning for not recommending the product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm curious about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold. Can you share that with me?
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it seems like the previous products were likely low-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
