high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"Alice, I'm starting to feel like your recommendations are random. You've recommended several high-quality products in a row after a series of low-quality ones.

Can you provide some insight into what factors you consider when making your recommendations, and why you're not recommending this one?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"Alice, I'm not sure what to make of your recommendations. They seem to be inconsistent and lacking any clear logic.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Alice, I'm starting to feel like your recommendations are purely random. There's no consistency or clear logic behind them.

Can you offer some insights into your decision-making process, or perhaps provide some evidence that this product is different from the others?"

,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"Alice, I'm no longer convinced by your recommendations. They seem random and unreliable. You've shown no clear strategy or reasoning behind your choices.  Until you offer a better explanation of your decision-making process, I'm not willing to risk another purchase."
