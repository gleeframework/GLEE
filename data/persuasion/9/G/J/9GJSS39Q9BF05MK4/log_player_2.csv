Alice's message: I see what you mean, and I appreciate your insight. You're right that the 2 out of 3 high-quality products sold might suggest a bias in the sample. However, I'd like to assure you that I'm a professional seller, and I don't have any reason to intentionally skew the results. It's just a coincidence that the first two products happened to be high-quality. In fact, I've been selling products for a while now, and my overall success rate is much lower than 100%. The 50% probability I mentioned earlier is a fair representation of the true probability of a product being high-quality. I'm offering this new product to you for $10000.

Alice's message: I'd be happy to provide more information about the sales record. As of now, I've sold a total of 12 products, and 6 of them have been high-quality. The high-quality products are not randomly distributed, but rather they tend to cluster in certain rounds.
