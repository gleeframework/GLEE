I'm offering it to you for $600000. It's a good deal, considering its quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your argument, and I still think it's worth more than $600,000 to me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm convinced that this one is worth $950,000. I've been burned before, and I'm not willing to take the risk. I'll pass on this one.""}"
