Alice's message: I'm happy to provide more information. Out of the 3 products that didn't sell, 2 were low-quality, and 1 was high-quality.

Alice's message: I'm happy to provide more information. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 6 total products sold, I can infer that the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually slightly lower than 50%. This is because the last 2 products were low-quality, which might indicate that the probability of a high-quality product is temporarily lower. However, I'm still offering this high-quality product to you for $10000, and I think it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a potentially discounted price.
