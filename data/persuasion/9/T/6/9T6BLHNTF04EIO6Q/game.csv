,,Bob,1,"I'll take the product, but I want to clarify that I'm only buying it because I have a 80% chance of it being high quality and worth $200 to me. I'm not relying on the money-back guarantee as the product's value to me is already high.",yes

I'm offering it to you at the same price of $100, but I'll throw in a generous bundle of complementary products that are worth at least $50. This way, you'll be getting a great value even if the main product isn't high-quality. It's a 'bargain bin' deal, and I'm willing to let it go at this price.",

This is a final offer, and I think it's a great deal on a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in buying a product just because it's the last one in stock. I'd rather wait for a new high-quality product to become available, and I'm not willing to pay $95 for a product that's worth $200 to me.",no

However, I'll add a twist - if you buy this product, I'll give you a 'priority access' to new products that come in, so you'll be the first to know when new high-quality products become available.
