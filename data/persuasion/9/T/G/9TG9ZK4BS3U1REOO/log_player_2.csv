**Explanation:**

Since the statistics show that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, this means Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products.  While the inherent probability of a product being high-quality is only 80%, Alice's perfect track record significantly increases the perceived value of the product. 

Given the potential payoff of $200 and the recommendation from Alice, buying the product presents a positive expected value."
