,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know what your recommendation is based on. Are you recommending it because you know its quality or is it just a general recommendation?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product. Was it a high-quality or low-quality product?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively low based on the limited data. I'd like to see more sales before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice is recommending it because she knows it's a high-quality product, and I don't want to get stuck with a low-quality one. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics, before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, there's only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, and I'm not convinced that the second product will be high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the first buyer bought a high-quality product, and she wants to make a sale. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality or not before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 sold, which means there's a 100% success rate. However, this is likely due to a coincidence and the true probability of a high-quality product is still 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the probability of it being low-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'm not basing my decision solely on Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, Alice."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I think the probability of the product being low quality is still relatively high, and I'd rather pass on it to see if the next buyer has a better chance of getting a high-quality product."

,,Alice,19,no,
