Alice's message: I've sold 9 high-quality products out of 11 total products, which means the probability of a product being high-quality is 81.82%. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100. Let me give you a rough estimate of the expected value: if this product is high-quality, it's worth $100 to you. If it's low-quality, it's worth $0. So, the expected value is 81.82% * $100 = $81.82. I think this is a good deal, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.
