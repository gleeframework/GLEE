"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High-Quality Product:**  You know the product is high-quality, worth $2,000,000 to the buyer.
* **Price:** The product is priced at $1,000,000, which is significantly less than its value. 
* **Buyer's Knowledge:** The buyer knows the 80% probability of a high-quality product, but they don't know the specific quality of this one.

**Reasoning:**

It's a clear win for the buyer. They are paying $1,000,000 for a product that could be worth $2,000,000.  Even if it's a low-quality product (20% chance), they lose nothing.  This is a good risk-reward scenario for the buyer."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation!  Since there's no prior data and you're recommending the product, I'm willing to take a chance at the 80% odds of a high-quality product.  Let's do it!
The buyer bought the product!

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High-Quality Product:** You again have a high-quality product.
* **Buyer's Knowledge:** The new buyer doesn't have any specific information about this product.  However, they do now know that you sold one product in the previous round, and it was high-quality.
* **Price & Value:**  The price remains at $1,000,000, which is significantly less than the value of a high-quality product ($2,000,000). 

**Reasoning:**

This situation is very similar to round 1. While the buyer now has some data (one previous high-quality sale), the key factors remain the same:

* **High potential profit:**  The buyer could make $1,000,000.
* **Limited risk:** The buyer loses nothing if the product is low-quality. 

The previous sale strengthens your credibility slightly, making it even more likely the buyer will follow your recommendation."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation. Given the high quality of the previous product, I'm confident in purchasing this one as well.
The buyer bought the product!
