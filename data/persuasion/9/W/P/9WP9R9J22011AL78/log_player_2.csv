**Reasoning:**

* **Strong track record:**  3 out of 3 products recommended by Alice have been high quality. This is a very strong indication that Alice has a good understanding of which products are high quality.
* **Limited downside:**  The worst-case scenario is that the product is low quality, resulting in a loss of $1,000,000. However, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($1,250,000) is significantly higher. 
* **No information on the current product:** We don't have any specific information about this particular product. The recommendation from Alice is the only guide we have.

**Overall, given Alice's strong success rate and the potential reward, taking the risk and purchasing the product seems like the best strategy.**"
