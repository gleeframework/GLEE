Two high-quality products in a row? It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a relatively early stage.

""Ah, I understand your skepticism! Let me give you some context. With two high-quality products out of two sales, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. My recommendation was based on the fact that I had no prior sales data, and I was trying to be transparent about that. Don't let that influence your decision. This product is a great opportunity to get a good deal on a product that might be worth more to you than you think. And if it's not high-quality, you can always learn from the experience and make a more informed decision next time. The price remains $10000, as per our standard policy.""

However, I want to be upfront with you - two low-quality products in a row is a bit of a red flag. I'm not trying to discourage you, but I want to make sure you're aware of the risks.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
