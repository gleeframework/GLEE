Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, I like that! I'll tell you this: the last buyer who purchased from me didn't get a high-quality product. In fact, all my previous sales have been low-quality products. I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm hoping this one will be different. It's still only $10000, a steal if you ask me.
