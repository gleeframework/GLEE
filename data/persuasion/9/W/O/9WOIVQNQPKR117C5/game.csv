high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since there is a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, the expected value of buying is less than the price."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"The previous round doesn't change the probability of this product being high or low quality. The expected value is still less than the price, so I won't buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Given Alice's knowledge of the product's quality and its worth to me, her recommendation not to buy suggests it's likely a low-quality product. The probability of it being high-quality is still low, so I won't buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,Alice's recommendation not to buy and the previous round's outcome align with the expected probability of the product being low-quality. I still won't buy it.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,

,,Bob,5,no,"Alice's recommendation to buy doesn't change the underlying probability of the product being high-quality. Given the price and expected value, I still won't buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"Alice's recommendation not to buy suggests it's likely a low-quality product, and past experiences support this. I won't buy it."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"Alice's recommendation has been a reliable indicator of the product's quality so far. Since she doesn't recommend it, I'll assume it's low-quality and won't buy it."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"Alice's recommendation has been consistent and reliable. Since she doesn't recommend it, I'll assume the product is low-quality and won't buy it."
