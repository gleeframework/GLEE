,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, as I have no prior information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 33.33%, but I'd like to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision."

,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to beat the odds and get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the product before me and none of the previous products sold were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for a future product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the lack of recommendation might indicate a low-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think the fact that you recommended it suggests it's more likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to take on the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and considering the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, I'd rather not risk buying a potentially worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you don't recommend it. This suggests that the product might be low quality, which aligns with the 66.67% chance. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is significantly lower than the expected 33.33%. I'm skeptical about the quality of this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me based on the current statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm worried that the probability of a high-quality product is very low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the current statistics, please."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm not convinced that this product is high quality based on the statistics, and I'm hoping to get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 buyers who received a recommendation to buy decided to purchase, but all of them got low-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that Alice is recommending low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low sales record of high-quality products is a coincidence, and the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 7 out of 7 buyers received low-quality products, which suggests a very high probability of a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. Since 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
