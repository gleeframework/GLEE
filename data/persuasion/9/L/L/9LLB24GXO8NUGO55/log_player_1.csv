"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has revealed the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, it makes sense to recommend buying.  There's a good chance the product will be worth more to Bob than the price, and he has no way to know otherwise."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I will take the risk and purchase the product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
