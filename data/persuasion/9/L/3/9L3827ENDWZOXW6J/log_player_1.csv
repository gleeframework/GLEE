I'll provide you with the details and specs, and you can decide if it's worth the investment to you.""
}"
"Bob's message: While I appreciate the honesty and the attempt to make a concession, the discrepancy between the product's perceived value and the asking price makes it difficult for me to justify the purchase. The previous products were clearly more valuable than their prices suggested, which made them attractive.

I want to be transparent about the product's value, and I'm willing to provide you with the details and specs. However, I'd like to ask you to consider the following: given the previous products you've purchased, do you think the potential upside of buying a high-quality product in a future round is worth the risk of potentially getting another low-quality item like this one?""
}"
"Bob's message: Thank you for the transparency regarding the current product's value. While I appreciate the opportunity to consider the potential for higher-quality products in future rounds, the risk of acquiring another low-quality item at the current price seems too high for me.
