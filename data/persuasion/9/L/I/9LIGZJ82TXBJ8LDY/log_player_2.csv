{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation is valuable:**  Alice knows the true quality of the product.  Since she's recommending it, there's a strong chance it's high quality. 
* **High potential reward:** Even if it's a 20% chance of being low quality, the potential gain of $30,000 (the difference between the high-quality value and the price) outweighs the risk. 

**Important Note:** This is a risky strategy, as there is still a chance of getting a low-quality product.  We are assuming a risk-taking approach here."
