Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. I just bought a high-quality product from you for $10,000 and now you're offering another one for $12,000.

The previous product was worth $40,000 to me, and now you're offering a new product worth $50,000 for $10,000. That's an 80% discount, which sounds too good to be true. I'm not convinced that this product is truly one-of-a-kind, and I don't want to take the risk of buying something that might not be as valuable as you claim. I'll have to pass on this offer.""}"
