"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product has an 80% chance of being high quality, which is worth $12,000 to you, and only a 20% chance of being low quality, which is worth $0 to you, the expected value of buying the product is:

(0.8 * $12,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $9,600

The expected value is positive, meaning you are likely to make a profit by buying the product. It's always a gamble, but in this case, the odds are in your favor."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again for the recommendation! I'll take another one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

The information from the previous round doesn't change the inherent odds of this round.  Each product is independent, meaning the quality of one product doesn't influence the quality of another. Therefore, the expected value calculation is still the same:

(0.8 * $12,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $9,600

It's still a positive expected value, so buying the product remains the best strategy."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!

```

**Explanation:**

As in the previous rounds, the quality of each product is independent. Even though you've bought two high-quality products in a row, the odds haven't changed. The expected value of buying the product remains:

(0.8 * $12,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $9,600

It's still a positive expected value, so buying the product is the best strategy."

**Explanation:**

As before, the quality of each product is independent. The previous rounds' results don't affect the current round's odds. The expected value remains positive:
