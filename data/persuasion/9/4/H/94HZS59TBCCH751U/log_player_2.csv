Alice's message: I've now sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products. Given the statistics, it's likely that the remaining products are also high-quality.

However, I want to be transparent with you - it's possible that I've been selling high-quality products due to chance, and the next product might be low-quality. I'll give you a more nuanced view of the situation: given the probability of 80% high-quality products, I'd expect to have sold 3.2 high-quality products by now. Since I've sold 4, it's possible that the next product is indeed high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I'll also give you the option to buy it for $120 if you're confident in its quality.
