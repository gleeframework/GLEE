Alice's message: Welcome to our store! We're excited to offer you a unique product for $10000. As you may know, we've sold 1 product so far, and 0 of them have been high-quality. I want to assure you that we're committed to providing the best possible experience. Since this is our first product, I'm willing to take a calculated risk and offer it to you at this price. Will you take a chance and make it yours?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the willingness to take a chance on the first product, but with no past sales data to go on, I'm not comfortable paying $10,000 for a product with a 66.67% chance of being worthless to me. I'll pass for now, but I might be interested in future products if there's more data to consider.""}

We've now sold 2 products, and unfortunately, both of them have been low-quality. I want to assure you that we're working hard to improve our quality control. With this new information, I'm willing to offer you a slightly discounted price of $9500 for this product. It's still a unique opportunity to be one of our early customers and potentially benefit from our future improvements. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
