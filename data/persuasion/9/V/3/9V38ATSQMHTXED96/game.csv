high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm glad I made a profit on the first product, but I'm not sure if I should take the risk again. Since the probability of getting a high-quality product is 50%, I might not be able to make a profit again. I'd rather wait and see what happens in the next rounds."
