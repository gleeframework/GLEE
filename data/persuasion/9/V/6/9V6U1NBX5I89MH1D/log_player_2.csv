Alice's message: I have sold 0 products so far, and I have a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product. If you buy this product, you will have a 50% chance of getting a $4000000 product, but a 50% chance of getting nothing. It's a gamble, but I assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. The product is available for $1000000. What do you say?

Alice's message: You've seen that I've sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. This means that the probability of me selling a high-quality product is now 50% (1/2) because the first product was high-quality, and the probability of selling a low-quality product is 50% (1/2). However, you know that the probability of a high-quality product is 50% in general. Since I've sold one high-quality product out of two, it's possible that I'm just lucky, and the next product might be low-quality. But it's also possible that I'm on a hot streak! I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. What do you think?

~
Alice's message: You've seen that I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row now. This is a significant streak, and it's possible that I'm selling high-quality products more frequently than the general 50% chance. However, it's also possible that I'm just lucky. Since you know that I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products, you might infer that the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than 50%. But keep in mind that this is just an inference, and the probability could still be 50%. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. What do you think?

Alice's message: You've seen that I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, and then a low-quality product. This is a clear deviation from the expected pattern, and it suggests that my previous streak was just a coincidence. In fact, this low-quality product is a good reminder that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, and I'm not on a hot streak after all. With 3 high-quality products out of 4, you might be tempted to think that I'm selling high-quality products more frequently than expected, but the truth is that I'm just as likely to sell a low-quality product as a high-quality one. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. What do you think?
