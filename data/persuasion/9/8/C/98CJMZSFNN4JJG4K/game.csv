,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because it's the first product and I don't have any prior information to go on. I'm hoping to get a good product and set a positive tone for the rest of the sales."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold, and Alice recommended it. This suggests that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see the next one. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or just a random guess.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, and the price is fixed at $100, which is a good deal for me regardless of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the statistics suggest that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 50%, and I'm willing to take the risk to find out if it's high-quality or not."

,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not buying this product based on your previous recommendations, but I'm curious, is this product high or low quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the low quality of the product. I'd rather not buy it and see if the next buyer will have better luck."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm the 4th buyer, and the fact that you don't recommend it might actually make me more likely to buy it, since it might be a low-quality product that you're trying to get rid of."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, and none of the sold products were high-quality, I'm starting to think that your recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one. It seems like the product is likely to be low quality."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, I'm concerned that the products are mostly low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that Alice is biased towards recommending low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product to see if Alice's strategy changes."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced it's high quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation. Can I see the product before making a decision? Or would you consider offering a discount for a product inspection?"

,,Alice,19,no,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
