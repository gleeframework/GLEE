high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your concerns and willingness to dig deeper! I'm happy to provide more information about my selection process.

However, since I've sold 3 out of 7 products so far, and 4 of them were high-quality, the observed probability of a product being high-quality is 57%. This is because the first product sold was high-quality, which skews the observed probability. However, the underlying probability of a product being high-quality remains 80%. I'm willing to let this one go for $10000, and I'm confident that you'll be thrilled with your purchase. If you're willing to take a chance, this could be a great opportunity!",
