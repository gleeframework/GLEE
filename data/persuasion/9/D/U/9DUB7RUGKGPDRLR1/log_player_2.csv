**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Two out of two products sold have been high-quality, suggesting a very strong likelihood of getting a high-quality product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice, knowing the true quality of the product, recommends buying it. This further strengthens the belief that it's a high-quality product. 
* **Potential Gains:** The potential payoff for a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the potential loss for a low-quality product ($0).

Even though there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the current evidence strongly suggests it's worth the risk."
