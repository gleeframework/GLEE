low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since it's the first one and I don't have any information to go by."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%, and the expected value is not worth the risk of paying $1000000 for a potentially worthless product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and chose to do so, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I think the previous buyer's decision might have been influenced by your recommendation, so I'm not taking it into account. I'm basing my decision solely on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I think the potential reward is worth it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend me to buy the product, I'm going to pass on it. I'm curious to know the quality of the product, but I'm not going to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product based on Alice's advice."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation or more information before making a decision."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the previous sales record. With 3 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it seems likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,14,yes,
