Given the evidence, I think it's a great opportunity to buy a high-quality product!""}"

The two high-quality products I've sold so far were sold in separate transactions, one in Round 1 and one in Round 3. I'm not saying that the first buyer was somehow 'lucky' or that I'm somehow'stacking the deck'. I'm just offering you a product that I think has an 80% chance of being high-quality, based on the statistics. And now that you know that two out of three products have been high-quality, the probability of this next product being high-quality is actually higher than 80%! I'd like to offer you this next product for $10,000.""}"

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""You're taking a calculated risk! With 4 high-quality products out of 5 total products sold, the probability that the next product is high-quality is actually 80% (4/5). However, I'd like to point out that this is actually lower than the initial probability, because we've now sold 5 products and only 4 of them were high-quality.

Would you like to take the chance?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is 66.67%, which is higher than the overall probability before. I'm not convinced that the probability is actually 66.67% and I'm hoping to get lucky.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your negotiation skills! However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to budge on the price. I've already sold 5 products to you, and I'm still offering it to you for $10,000. The fact that 4 out of 7 previous buyers passed on low-quality products doesn't necessarily mean the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 80%.
