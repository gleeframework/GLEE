,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is still 50%, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that all previous buyers have rejected the product, which suggests that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation on the next product, which might be more informative."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers' purchases were all low-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not buying, I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product based on your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high quality is low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't buy the product, and no high-quality products were sold, I suspect that all 4 previous products were low-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, the probability of all 4 products being low-quality is (1/2)^4 = 1/16. This is a very low probability, suggesting that the previous products were indeed low-quality. Therefore, I'm inclined to believe that the current product is likely to be high-quality, but I'll pass on it to be cautious."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping for a high-quality product!"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous sales record, it seems that all products sold so far have been low-quality, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be higher than 50%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous sales record, which suggests a high proportion of low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,18,no,

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
