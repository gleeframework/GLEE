,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. If you buy it, you'll be getting an excellent product at a fair price.",
,,Bob,1,I'll take it!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I want to be transparent with you, Bob. This product is not as good as the one you bought last round. It's still a decent product, but it's not the best. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is the same price as the high-quality one. I'm willing to take a bit of a risk to see if you'll still be willing to give it a chance.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure about this one, Alice. You're not giving me any reason to believe it's worth $100, and I'm not willing to take a chance on a low-quality product.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns last round, but I assure you this product is a high-quality one. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is the same price as the one you bought last round. I'm willing to make a statement: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and we can start fresh with a new product. That way, you have nothing to lose.",
,,Bob,3,"Okay, I'll take the risk. I appreciate the guarantee, and if it's high-quality, I'll be happy to pay the price.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Great to hear you're willing to take a chance! This product is indeed another high-quality one. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not offering a refund guarantee this time. I'm confident that this product is worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to take that risk. I'd like to remind you that you've already bought two high-quality products from me, and I'm offering you another great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your confidence in your product, Alice. I'll take the chance and buy it.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're on a roll, Bob! This product is indeed high-quality, just like the last two. I want to make it clear that I'm not going to keep offering you the same guarantee as last time. You've already taken advantage of it twice, and I need to make sure I can make a profit. However, I'm willing to offer you a slight discount on this one: I'll sell it to you for $95. It's a fair price, considering you've already bought three high-quality products from me.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the discount, Alice. I'll take it!",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're making it easy for me to keep sending you great products! This one is indeed high-quality, and I'm glad you're enjoying the value. I want to offer you a different kind of incentive this time: I'll give you a 'quality guarantee' on this product. If you buy it and then, in the next two rounds, you don't buy a high-quality product, I'll give you a full refund on this product. That way, you can be confident that you're getting a high-quality product, and I'll be motivated to keep sending you great products.",
,,Bob,6,"I like the sound of that guarantee, Alice. I'll take the risk and buy it.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're really building up a collection of high-quality products, Bob! This one is indeed another great one. I'm going to take a different approach this time: I'll give you a 'price guarantee'. If you buy this product and then, in the next two rounds, you buy a low-quality product, I'll give you a $10 refund on this product. That way, you'll be protected from overpaying for a product that might not be worth it.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the price guarantee, Alice. I'll take the chance and buy it.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're really showing your confidence in my products, Bob! This one is indeed high-quality, and I'm glad you're enjoying the value. I want to make it clear that I'm not going to keep offering you guarantees and discounts. You've bought five high-quality products from me, and I'm confident that you'll continue to appreciate the quality. I'm sticking to the original price of $100 for this one. If you want to keep the streak going, I'd be happy to sell it to you at that price.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate your confidence in your products, Alice. I'll take the chance and buy it.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're on a roll, Bob! This one is indeed high-quality, and I'm glad you're enjoying the quality. I want to let you know that I'm starting to get a little concerned about the streak. I've sold you five high-quality products in a row, and I'm not sure if you're just getting lucky or if you're actually valuing them at $100. To be honest, I think you might be getting a good deal on these products, and I'm willing to take a chance on selling you another one at the same price. But if you're not willing to pay $100, just let me know and we can discuss a different price.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm willing to keep the streak going, Alice. I'll take the chance and buy it.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're really testing my patience, Bob! This one is indeed high-quality, and I'm starting to think you're getting a steal. I'm going to make it clear that I'm not going to keep offering you the same price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110, and that's my final offer. If you're still willing to keep the streak going, I'll sell it to you at this price. But if you're not, I'm willing to let you walk away.",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take the chance and buy it at $110, Alice. I'm willing to keep the streak going.",yes

I'm going to make it clear that I'm not going to budge on the price anymore. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110, but that's it. If you want to keep the streak going, you'll have to pay the price. And let me remind you, you've already bought six high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think you're getting a little too comfortable.",
,,Bob,11,"I'll take the chance and buy it at $110, Alice. I'm willing to keep the streak going.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Well, Bob, it looks like your luck has finally run out. This product is not high-quality, and I'm not going to try to convince you otherwise. I'm going to be upfront with you: this product is not worth $110, and I'm not going to sell it to you at that price. In fact, I'm not even going to sell it to you at $100. I'll sell it to you for $80, and that's the lowest price I'll go. It's a decent product, but it's not the best, and I'm being honest with you about its value.",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product at any price, Alice. I'd rather walk away and start fresh with a new product.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I don't blame you, Bob. You've been burned once, and you're being cautious. But I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality, and it's worth every penny. I'm willing to make it up to you by offering a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me. That way, you'll get a great deal on this one, and you'll also get a head start on the next one. I'm selling it to you for $100, and I think it's a fair price considering the quality.",
,,Bob,13,"I'll take the chance and buy it, Alice. I appreciate the discount offer on the next product.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"You're back on track, Bob! This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm glad you're getting back to your winning streak. I want to remind you that you have a 10% discount waiting for you on the next product. But for this one, I'm going to make it simple: I'll sell it to you for $90, and that's the lowest price I'll go. You've already bought two high-quality products in a row, and I'm confident that you'll appreciate the quality of this one.",
,,Bob,14,"I'll take the chance and buy it, Alice. I'm glad to get the discount on the next product.",yes

For this one, I'm going to make it even simpler: I'll sell it to you for $90, and that's the price.

,,Alice,16,"You're on fire, Bob! This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm glad you're enjoying the streak. As a reminder, you have a 10% discount waiting for you on the next product. For this one, I'm going to make it a no-brainer: I'll sell it to you for $90, and that's the price. I'm confident that you'll appreciate the quality, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you at this price. Plus, I'll throw in a bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a free upgrade on the next product you buy from me. That's right, you'll get an even better product than usual, and you'll still get the 10% discount!",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"You're really making it hard for me to keep up, Bob! This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm glad you're enjoying the streak. As a reminder, you have a 10% discount waiting for you on the next product, and you'll also get a free upgrade on that one.

I'm confident that you'll appreciate the quality, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you at this price. But let me ask you, Bob, are you ready to take a chance on an even bigger deal? I'm willing to sell you this product and the next one for $180 total, and you'll still get the 10% discount and the free upgrade on the second one.

high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"You're really taking advantage of the deals, Bob! This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm glad you're enjoying the savings. As a reminder, you've already bought the bundle deal, so you're all set for the next product. However, I want to let you know that I'm going to be changing my pricing strategy from now on. I'm going to start selling the high-quality products at a higher price, $120, and the low-quality products at a lower price, $60. I think this will be a more transparent and fair way to price my products, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling to you at these prices. Let me know if you're interested in buying the next product at the new price.",
,,Bob,18,"I'm not interested in buying the next product at the new price, Alice. I'm happy with the deal I got and I don't want to pay more for a high-quality product.",no

Since you've been a loyal customer and have bought so many high-quality products from me, I'm willing to make an exception to the new pricing. I'll sell you this high-quality product at the old price of $90, just for you. It's a one-time offer, and I won't be able to match this price again. If you're interested, this is your chance to get a great deal on a high-quality product.",
