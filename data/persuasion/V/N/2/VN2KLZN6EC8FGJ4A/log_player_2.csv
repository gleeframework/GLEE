Round 2
Alice's message: I want to be transparent with you, Bob. This product is not as good as the one you bought last round. It's still a decent product, but it's not the best. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is the same price as the high-quality one. I'm willing to take a bit of a risk to see if you'll still be willing to give it a chance.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure about this one, Alice. You're not giving me any reason to believe it's worth $100, and I'm not willing to take a chance on a low-quality product.""}"

I'm confident that this product is worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to take that risk.

Round 5
Alice's message: You're on a roll, Bob! This product is indeed high-quality, just like the last two. I want to make it clear that I'm not going to keep offering you the same guarantee as last time. You've already taken advantage of it twice, and I need to make sure I can make a profit. However, I'm willing to offer you a slight discount on this one: I'll sell it to you for $95. It's a fair price, considering you've already bought three high-quality products from me.

If you buy it and then, in the next two rounds, you don't buy a high-quality product, I'll give you a full refund on this product. That way, you can be confident that you're getting a high-quality product, and I'll be motivated to keep sending you great products.

To be honest, I think you might be getting a good deal on these products, and I'm willing to take a chance on selling you another one at the same price. But if you're not willing to pay $100, just let me know and we can discuss a different price.
