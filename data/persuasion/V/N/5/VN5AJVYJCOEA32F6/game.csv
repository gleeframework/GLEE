,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality and I'm not sure if it's high or low quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to see the statistics of the first product before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, but I'm aware that the odds are not in my favor. I'm doing this to get a feel for the game and to see how Alice's recommendation works."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, I'm willing to take the risk because I know the probability of a high-quality product is 80% and I can afford to lose $10000 on a low-quality product"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that only 1 out of 2 products sold was high quality, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 attempts, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the previous sales record. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is a low-quality one. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 2 products sold was high-quality, which is a 50% success rate. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm concerned that the low-quality product is more likely to be the one that hasn't been sold yet, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2. Given the probability of the product being high-quality is 80%, I expect the probability of the product being high-quality given that you recommended it is 80% * (1/2) = 40%. I'd like to wait for the next product to get a better estimate of the true proportion of high-quality products."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling a high-quality product to the first two buyers, so I'm not convinced that the current product is high-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased, and only 1 high-quality product was sold, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than the expected 80%. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 out of 2 products sold was high-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd rather wait for the next product to get a better idea of the distribution of high-quality products."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics so far.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'd like to wait and see if the next product has a better quality."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the recommendation was based on the previous sales record, and I'd like to get a more informed decision. Can I ask for more information about the previous sales?"
