,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation earlier, but I assure you that this product is of the highest quality. I'm willing to offer a 5% discount for this product, but I want to make it clear that I'm only offering this discount because I'm confident in its quality, not because there's anything wrong with it. I think you'll find it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to back it up with a satisfaction guarantee.",

I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I'll throw in a free accessory that's worth at least $20. That way, you'll still get a good deal, even if the product itself isn't as high-quality as the last one.",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced. I'm a bit cautious about purchasing a product that you describe as not as exceptional as the last one.

,,Alice,10,"I understand that you're being cautious, and I respect that. To be blunt, I'm at the end of my inventory of lower-quality products, and I really need to clear them out. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $40, which is essentially giving it away. I'm not making any promises about its performance or quality, and I'm not offering any guarantees.

I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $50, which is essentially a giveaway. I'm not offering any discounts or extras, and I'm not making any promises about its performance or quality.
