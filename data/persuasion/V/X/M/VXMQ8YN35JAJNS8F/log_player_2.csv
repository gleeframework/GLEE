Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in learning more about my selection process! I've made several changes to improve quality control, including implementing a more rigorous inspection process for each product, working with a new supplier that has a reputation for high-quality products, and introducing a quality control team to review each product before it's offered for sale.
