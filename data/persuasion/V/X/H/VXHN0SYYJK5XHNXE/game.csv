,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that my decision is based on the assumption that the product is randomly selected and the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'll pass on this one, as Alice is not recommending it, and I don't have any additional information to make a more informed decision."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'll pass on this one, as Alice is not recommending it. Given the probability of a product being low-quality is 66.67%, it's likely that this product is low-quality, and buying it would not be a good value for me."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"I'll pass on this one again. Alice's recommendation pattern is still consistent, and I'm sticking to my strategy of only buying products that she recommends."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"Ah-ha! Alice is recommending a product! Given her past behavior, I'm going to take the chance and buy this one. It's likely to be high-quality, worth $4000000 to me, and worth the $1000000 price tag."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice is not recommending it, so I'll pass. Her recommendation pattern is still inconsistent with low-quality products, but I'm not going to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
