high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as I don't have any information about its quality and I'm not convinced by your previous recommendation. I'd like to wait and see what the next buyer does."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you tell me how many products you've sold so far, and what the proportion of high-quality products sold is?"

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision. Can you give me more information about the product's quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll buy the product, but I expect you to reveal its quality afterwards."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low-quality, I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems that Alice has recommended 2 products to previous buyers and none of them were high quality. This makes me suspect that the products Alice recommends are more likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for a product that Alice hasn't recommended yet, or get more information about the product before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, as Alice's recommendation is not based on any information about this specific product's quality, but rather on the overall statistics. With only 2 sales and no high-quality products sold, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I think it's likely that the product I'm offered is low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious about the probability of a high-quality product being sold, given the lack of high-quality products in the previous sales. I'm not necessarily interested in the product itself, but I'm interested in the game's dynamics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is against it, which suggests the product is likely to be low-quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $10000, which is a good deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a 50% discount. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it, which suggests it might be a low-quality product, and I'm trying to balance the risk with the potential reward."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? I want to make an informed decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 6 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I think it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high quality might be low."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality."
