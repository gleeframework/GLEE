With 1 high-quality product sold out of 6, the probability of the product being high-quality is 1/6. However, considering that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm going to calculate the expected value. The expected value of buying the product is (1/6) * 120 + (5/6) * 0 = 20. Since the expected value is less than the price of $100, I'd rather pass on the product.""
