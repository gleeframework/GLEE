Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your diligence in seeking accurate information. You're correct that the actual probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I'd like to put your mind at ease by sharing that the product I'm offering you is indeed high-quality. In fact, I've just sold one high-quality product out of two, which is a great indicator of the quality of my products. With this information, I'm confident that you'll be getting a product that's worth $30000 to you. The price of $10000 is still a great value, considering the potential value you'll get from this product. Will you take advantage of this opportunity?

Considering this, I'm offering you an opportunity to own a high-quality product at the same price of $10000. With the potential value of $30000, this is still a great deal.
