Alice's message: I understand your hesitation in the previous round. Let me give you some context: I've sold 2 products so far, and both of them were high-quality. The statistics suggest that the probability of this product being high-quality is very high. I'm willing to sell this product to you for the same price of $10000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, considering the odds are in your favor.
