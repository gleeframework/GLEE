high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't have any information about its quality and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when I could potentially get a high-quality one for $125."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'm not going to buy the product. I want to see how many high-quality products are sold first to get a better idea of the overall quality of the products.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see the statistics on the quality of the products before making a decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because it's the first product and I have no information to go on. I'm doing this to set a baseline for the proportion of high-quality products, and I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on any information or just a random guess."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation. I want to see more data on the sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product. Was it a high-quality product that made them decide to buy, or was it just a lucky guess?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I want to see more data before making a decision, especially since the first product sold was high quality, which might be a lucky draw. I'd like to know the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that you recommended it to me. Given that you recommended it, it's likely to be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you provide that information before I make my final decision?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 out of 1 product sold was high quality, I'm skeptical about the proportion of high-quality products in the pool. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience before making a decision. Did they purchase a high-quality product?
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase. The fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 total product sold suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the overall 80% probability. I'd like to see more data to get a better sense of the true quality distribution.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is reliable given the small sample size of sales and the fact that the first buyer purchased the product, which might be a coincidence."
