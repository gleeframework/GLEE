,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this product for $10000! With over 10 products sold so far, I can confidently say that 5 of them have been high-quality. I'm not at liberty to disclose the details of the sales, but I can assure you that all products are carefully curated and meet certain standards. I'm willing to take the risk and sell you this product at a fixed price of $10000. Will you take the chance and make an offer?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the chance and buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, but I'm hoping for the best.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the next round! I'm glad to see you're interested in my products. As you can see, I've sold 2 high-quality products out of the first 2 products I've offered. The remaining products are still waiting for a new home. I'm willing to offer you this product for $10000, just like the previous one. I'm confident that the chances of getting a high-quality product are still high, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you. What do you think? Will you take the chance and buy this product?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned that the high success rate you mentioned might be due to selection bias. I'd like to know more about the total number of products you've offered and the total number of buyers you've had so far. This will give me a better idea of the actual probability of getting a high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concern, and I'm happy to provide more information. I've offered a total of 3 products so far, and 1 of them has been high-quality. That's a 33% success rate. I've had 2 buyers, and both of them have purchased the product. I want to assure you that I'm not cherry-picking the best products for the first buyers, and I'm willing to sell you this product at the same price of $10000. I understand that the probability of getting a high-quality product is lower than before, but I still believe it's worth the risk. What do you think? Will you take the chance and buy this product?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to buy the product, but I want to negotiate the price. Given the 33% success rate and the fact that I'm the third buyer, I think the price should be adjusted accordingly. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome to the next round! I'm glad to see you're interested in my products. As you can see, I've sold 2 products so far, and 1 of them has been high-quality. That's a 50% success rate, which is actually higher than my initial average. I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe has a high chance of being high-quality as well. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000, the same price as before. I believe the quality of this product is worth the price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. What do you think? Will you take the chance and buy this product?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I'm concerned that the 50% success rate might be due to chance. Can you tell me more about the characteristics of the product that make you think it's high-quality?",no

Will you take the chance and buy this product?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know more about the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales. Is there any data on that?",yes

I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me more about the two high-quality products you've sold so far? Were they purchased by other buyers who were also enthusiastic like me, or were they bought by people who were more cautious?",no

One of them was willing to take a chance and buy the product at the initial price of $10000, and the other one negotiated the price down to $8000. Both buyers were happy with their purchases, and I'm confident that you'll be too. I'm willing to offer you this product for $10000, and I'm willing to consider negotiating the price if you're interested. What do you think? Will you take the chance and buy this product?",

,,Alice,11,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your analytical approach. I'm willing to provide you with some additional information, but I must emphasize that I'm not at liberty to disclose too much about the specific characteristics of the products. However, I can tell you that the 3 high-quality products were all unique in their own ways, and they shared some common traits that made them stand out. As for the 2 low-quality products, I can tell you that they were both... interesting, but ultimately didn't meet my standards.
