Since I've only sold 1, it's likely that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. This one, however, is high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.

Since I've only sold 2, it's likely that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. However, this one is indeed high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify the probability calculation. If the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 4, the expected number of high-quality products sold is indeed 3.2, but this is a weighted average. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80% because the sales record doesn't change the underlying probability.
