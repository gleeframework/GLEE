low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as there is no prior data to go on, and the risk of getting a low-quality product is still 50%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to see more data on the previous buyer's decision and the overall sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous buyer didn't purchase and no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to wait and observe more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation, but I'm curious about the product's quality. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer's experience? Was the product they bought high or low quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information about the previous sales record, such as the proportion of high-quality products sold and the total number of products sold. This will help me make a more informed decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. How many potential buyers have there been, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is still 50% and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have received low-quality products, I suspect that the remaining products are more likely to be low quality as well. I'd like to see more data or get a new recommendation before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a bad indicator of the product's quality. If she recommended it, it might be a low-quality product, but if she didn't recommend it, it might be a high-quality product. I'm taking a chance."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, it's likely that the previous products were low-quality. I'd like to wait for a product that Alice recommends to pass on, which might indicate a higher chance of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product or because you're trying to conserve the pool of available high-quality products for future buyers?
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the number of low-quality products sold so far, please."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have already purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the previous 5 buyers have all passed on the product, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $1000000. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because the previous buyers were all offered low-quality products or is there another reason?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products have been low quality, which suggests a very low probability of the product being high quality. I'd like to pass on this product."
