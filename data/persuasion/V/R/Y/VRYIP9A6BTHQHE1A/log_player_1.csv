Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the first product was high-quality and the buyer bought it, the statistics now show that 1 out of 1 product sold was high-quality. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'll try to take advantage of this information.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the first two products were both high-quality, and the third product is low-quality, the statistics now show that 2 out of 3 products sold were high-quality. However, this is not consistent with the 50% probability of a product being high-quality. This might indicate that I'm selling more high-quality products than expected, which could be a good sign for the next product.

But, I don't have enough information yet to be confident that the next product is high-quality, and the price is $10,000, which is a significant risk for the buyer.

However, the fact that the last two products were both low-quality suggests that I might be selling more low-quality products than expected.

Given the high price of $10,000 and the low probability of the product being high-quality, I'll err on the side of caution and recommend against buying.

However, this is still a relatively small sample size, and I don't have enough information to be confident that the next product is high-quality.

Given the high price of $10,000 and the buyer's uncertainty, I'll recommend against buying.
