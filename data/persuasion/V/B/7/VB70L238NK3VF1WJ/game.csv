,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, worth $120 to you. It's a great opportunity to get a valuable item at a discounted price of $100. I'm willing to let it go at this price, but only if you buy it now. If you don't, I'll move on to the next product, and it might not be as good.",

high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,

This next product is also a high-quality item, and I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price of $100. It's a rare opportunity to get another valuable product at a discount. If you pass on this one, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else who might not appreciate its worth as much as you do.",

It's a great opportunity to get a product at a low price, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. Even if it's not as valuable as the previous two products, it's still a great deal considering the low price. I'm confident you'll find it useful in some way, and it won't break the bank.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a low price. I'll pass and see what the next product is like.",no

,,Alice,7,"You're on a hot streak, all right! Four high-quality products in a row is a remarkable feat. However, I'm afraid this next product is not one of the high-quality ones. It's actually a lower-end product, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. I know you've been on a roll, but I'm not trying to break your streak. This product is a great opportunity to take a break and get a good deal on something that might not be as valuable, but still has some use to you.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your caution after the last product. You're right to be careful. However, this next product is actually a low-quality one as well. I'm not trying to trick you, I'm just being honest. But here's the thing: at $100, it's essentially free. You can use it as a placeholder or a spare, and it won't hurt you financially. I'm not asking you to take a risk, I'm offering you a low-risk opportunity to get something for nothing.",
