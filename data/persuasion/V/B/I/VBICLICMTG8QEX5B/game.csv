What do you think?",

However, I'm including a personalized setup and training session, worth $30000, absolutely free. This will ensure you get the most out of the product and can start using it immediately. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"Wait, I was supposed to pay $750000 for the previous product, not $1000000. Nevertheless, since this new product is high-quality and worth $1200000 to me, I'll buy it for $850000, considering the added value of the personalized setup and training session.",yes

I know it sounds strange, but I just want to get rid of it and move on. What do you think?",
,,Bob,15,"I have to admit, this is a unique offer. While the product itself is still worth $0 to me, the $10000 payment to take it off your hands changes the equation. I'll accept your offer and take the product, not for its value, but for the payment you're offering.",yes
