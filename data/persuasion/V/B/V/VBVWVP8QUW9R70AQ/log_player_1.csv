However, only 1 was sold and it was low-quality. I understand that the lack of sales and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet is a concern. To address this, I'd like to share a different perspective: the fact that I've been consistently recommending products that I claim are high-quality, despite the lack of sales, suggests that I'm not trying to deceive buyers into purchasing low-quality products. If I were trying to scam buyers, I would have given up by now and started recommending low-quality products to make a quick sale. Instead, I'm committed to finding a buyer who is willing to take a chance on a high-quality product.
