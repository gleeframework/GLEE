Alice's message: I see you're a critical thinker! I appreciate your diligence. I select the product randomly, but I can assure you that the quality is not correlated with the order in which it's offered. The first buyer who bought a product was indeed given a 50% chance of it being high-quality, and that was a coincidence. I don't have any control over the quality of the product, but I can tell you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80% in general.
