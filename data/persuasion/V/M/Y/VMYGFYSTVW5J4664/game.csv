The numbers are starting to tell a story, and I'm not sure if it's a good one. I'm willing to let this one go for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not sure what I'm selling. It could be a high-quality item, but it could also be a low-quality one. You're taking a risk either way.",

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad someone is willing to take a chance on me, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - my track record is looking pretty bad. 5 low-quality products in a row is not what I'd call a success story. But, I do have to admit that this next product is indeed high-quality. I've verified it myself, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself.",
