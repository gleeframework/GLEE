high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'm not going to buy the product yet. I'd like to see the outcome of the first sale to get a better idea of the product quality distribution.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as there's no prior data to go on, and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not expecting a recommendation from you, so I'm going in blind"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low quality, I'm concerned that the product you're recommending to me might also be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, especially since I know that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of the product being high quality might be higher than 33.33%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, and Alice's recommendation is to buy, I'm suspicious that the products sold so far were likely low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your previous recommendations. However, I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products after my decision, so I can make a more informed decision for the next product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is reliable given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I'm skeptical about the recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales, and the total number of products offered so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate that the products are mostly low-quality, and I don't want to risk wasting $1000000 on a product that's not worth it to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, but since Alice doesn't recommend it, I'll pass on it. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, so I can make a more informed decision in the future."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I'd like to take that chance."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, but I've seen that all previous buyers were discouraged from buying, and none of them bought a high-quality product. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer gets a better offer."
