I want to assure you that this product is just as good as the first one, and it's also worth $10000. However, I'll give you a slight nudge: I'm willing to let you know that I've already sold one high-quality product to you, so the probability of this one being high-quality is now 80% as well. But, I'm not giving you any information about the quality of the product. You'll have to decide based on the price and your trust in me.""

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{

As you've bought two high-quality products from me so far, the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80%. However, I want to give you a more nuanced perspective. Think of it this way: even if this product is low-quality, you've already bought two high-quality products from me, so you've already gotten a great deal. But, if this product is indeed high-quality, you'll be getting an even better deal than before. The price remains the same at $10000, but I'm willing to let you know that this is your last chance to buy a high-quality product at this price. What do you think?""
