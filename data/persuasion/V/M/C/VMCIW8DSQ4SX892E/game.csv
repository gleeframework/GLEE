,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I don't have any information about the quality of the product, so I'm willing to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer's decision and what made you decide not to recommend it to me?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both were low-quality products, I suspect the current product is also low-quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33%. Given the low probability of getting a high-quality product, I'd rather wait for the next one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 2 sales and 0 high-quality products sold, it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning for not recommending it?"

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, and I'd like to see if I can get a high-quality one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous sales record, where no high-quality products have been sold. This suggests a strong possibility that the product is low quality, and I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, considering the statistics. Are you trying to convey information about the product's quality?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/4, which is very low. I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered, as the probability of getting a high-quality product seems low."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it seems that the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation not to buy. Is there something in the product's quality or the sales record that led you to advise against it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm skeptical about the product given the seller's past recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 5 out of 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and rejected the product, which suggests that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, hoping it's the 6th high-quality product in a row."
