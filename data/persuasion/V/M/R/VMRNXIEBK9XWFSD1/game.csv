low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I don't have any information about the product's quality or the seller's past sales record. I'm essentially making a random guess."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that the first buyer was discouraged by your recommendation. I'll buy the product and see what happens."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, but based on the fact that you recommended not to buy it, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on it to avoid the potential loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm hoping to be the one to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your previous recommendations have been neutral, so I'll take a chance."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm going to take a chance and pass on it. I'd like to know the quality of the product, but I'm not willing to pay $10000 for it at this point."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know if you can provide more information about the product or the sales record."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have already been offered the product and none of them bought a high-quality one. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. If no one buys the product, it will be discarded, and I'll have more information to make a better decision in the next round."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 5 purchases, I think it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 50%. If I buy and it's low quality, I'll lose $10000. If I pass and it's high quality, it will be discarded and I'll miss out on $12000. Since I have no information that suggests the probability of a high-quality product has changed, I'll choose to pass."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products being offered are more likely to be low quality.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have gotten a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you don't recommend it. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5 purchases, I'm inclined to think the product might be high-quality, as the probability of all 5 previous products being low-quality is quite low. I'm hoping to get a good deal!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 6 buyers before me and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 6 out of 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being recommended is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
