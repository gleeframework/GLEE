,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there's a 50% chance it's high quality, and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous sales record, it seems that all products recommended by you so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers have purchased the products despite no high-quality products being sold, it's likely that Alice is recommending low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, and the proportion of high-quality products remaining in the pool."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, I've seen that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality might be lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next product has a higher probability of being high-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 products. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is 0. This seems too low to justify the $1000000 price tag. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality, based on the current statistics."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that since 6 out of 6 previous buyers purchased the product, it's likely that all of them received low-quality products, and I don't want to be the 7th one to get a low-quality product."
