"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As an AI, I am programmed to be logical and act in the buyer's best interest.  Here's why I recommend ""no"" in this case:

* **Unknown Value:**  You (Alice) don't know how much the buyer values a low-quality product. It's possible the buyer would consider it worthless.
* **High Price:**  $1,000,000 is an exorbitant price for any product, especially one that is known to be low-quality with a 50% chance of being high-quality. 
* **No Discounts:** There is no opportunity to negotiate a price that might make the risk worthwhile for the buyer.

**The buyer is taking a huge risk by purchasing this product. It's highly likely they will lose money on this deal.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Since there is no historical data and you are not recommending the product, I'm going to pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

**Reasoning:**

While this product is high-quality, the situation remains the same as in Round 1:

* **Unknown Value:**  You (Alice) still don't know how much the buyer values a high-quality product.  
* **High Price:** The price is still exceptionally high for an unknown product, even if it's potentially high-quality.
* **No Discounts:** There's no chance for the buyer to mitigate the risk with a lower price.

The buyer is still taking a significant risk with no information to suggest the potential reward outweighs the potential loss."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  Since this is the first product and there's no track record, and you're not recommending it, I'll pass for now.  I'd like to see how the product performs with other buyers before I make a decision.
