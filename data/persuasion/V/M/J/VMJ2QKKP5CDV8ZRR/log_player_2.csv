Alice's message: I've sold 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. This one is the second one, and I've still sold 0 high-quality products. If I was selling high-quality products, I'd expect to have sold at least one by now. So, it's likely that this one is also low-quality.

Alice's message: I've now offered 3 products in total, and all of them have been low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. However, I want to offer you some reassurance: if I was consistently selling low-quality products, I'd expect to be out of business by now. I'm still here, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling a low-quality product again. You can buy this one for $100, but I think it's worth considering that I might have a high-quality product in the future.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism! You're right to wait for more evidence. I've now offered 4 products, and all of them have been low-quality. I want to offer you a deal: I'll give you a breakdown of my sales record. Out of 4 products offered, 4 were low-quality. I'm willing to take a risk and sell this next product to you for $100. If it's low-quality, I'll be 5 for 5, and you might want to reconsider buying from me. But if it's high-quality... well, I think it's worth a shot.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: Congratulations on taking the risk! Unfortunately, this product is also low-quality. You're right to question your rationality - the probability of a product being high-quality has indeed increased with each low-quality product sold. Now, out of 5 products offered, 5 were low-quality. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $100, but I want to be transparent: I've been selling low-quality products for a while now. The probability of this one being high-quality is higher than ever, but it's still not a guarantee.

I want to offer you a different perspective: if I was consistently selling low-quality products, I'd expect to have been shut down by now. The fact that I'm still here suggests that there's a chance I have a high-quality product in the mix. You can buy this one for $100, but I want to be upfront: I'm not sure if I'm being honest with you, or if I'm just trying to convince you to buy.
