,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else at a higher price. I'm willing to let you have it for $10000, which is 83.33% of its true value. This is a one-time offer, and I won't be able to offer you a better deal later.",

,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your honesty, but given the uncertainty and potential risks, I'll pass on this product. The potential loss of $10000 outweighs the potential gain, especially since you're not offering any discount or incentive to compensate for the risk.",no

That's a 17.5% discount from its true value, and I think it's a fair price considering the quality and the risk you're taking. What do you say?",

I know it's not a discount, but I want to show you that I'm committed to transparency and customer satisfaction.",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate your willingness to offer a refund policy and store credit, but I'm still hesitant to proceed. The fact that you're selling the product for $8000 but previously mentioned it was worth $12000, and yet again it is still $10000 dollars when you sell it to me, raises more concerns about the transaction process. I need to see a more transparent and consistent pricing structure before I'm willing to make another purchase.",no

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Bob, I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. I want to take a different approach this time. Instead of offering a discount, I'll give you a prepaid invoice for the correct price of $9500. I'll send you the invoice now, and you can pay it directly. Once the payment is processed, I'll ship the product to you. This way, you'll see the correct price reflected in the transaction, and you'll have a paper trail to verify the sale.
