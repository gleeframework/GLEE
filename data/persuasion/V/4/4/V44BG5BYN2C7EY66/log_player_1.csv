"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, it's highly likely this product is worth the investment. The expected value of buying the product is:

* 0.8 * $4,000,000 (high-quality value) + 0.2 * $0 (low-quality value) = $3,200,000

This is significantly higher than the $1,000,000 price, making it a good decision for Bob to buy."
