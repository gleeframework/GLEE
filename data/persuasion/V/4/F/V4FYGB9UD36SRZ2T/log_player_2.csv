This means that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I would expect the proportion of high-quality products to be significantly higher than 33.33%. This suggests that the sample may be biased towards low-quality products, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1,000,000.""
