```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the value of the product to you, and she recommends buying it, this is a strong signal that the product is high quality. While there's still a 50% chance it's low quality, the potential reward of $2,000,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000."

```

**Reasoning:**
