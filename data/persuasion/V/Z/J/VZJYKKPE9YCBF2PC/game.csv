,,the buyer,7,"I'll take it, but I'm only buying because I think I can get a good deal, not because I believe your sales record is any indication of the product's quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've had five sales, and I can tell you that one of them was a high-quality product. The others... weren't. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this product is another standard offering. If you're looking to take a risk, it's $10000.",

,,the buyer,11,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not convinced. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'd like to see more evidence before making a purchase.

,,Alice,16,"I've had ten sales, with three high-quality products sold, and four buyers have passed on the opportunity. Out of the ten products sold, 30% have been high-quality.
