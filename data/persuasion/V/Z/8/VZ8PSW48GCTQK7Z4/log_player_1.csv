"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, you know this product is high-quality. While you don't know Bob's exact valuation for a high-quality product, there's a 50% chance it's worth more than $10,000 to him. Since the price is fixed and the product is non-refundable, it's always beneficial for Bob to buy a high-quality product if he believes there's a chance it's worth more to him than the asking price."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This time, you know the product is low-quality.  Since you don't know Bob's valuation for a low-quality product, it's impossible to know if it's worth $10,000 to him.  It's highly likely that a low-quality product is worth less than $10,000, so recommending Bob to buy it would be a risky move that could lead to a bad outcome for him."
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll take your recommendation into account for the next round.
Bob didn't bought the product.

```

**Reasoning:**

Even though you don't know Bob's exact valuation for a low-quality product, it's highly likely that a low-quality product is worth less than $10,000. Bob is demonstrating a cautious approach, having passed on the previous low-quality product.  Recommending another low-quality product risks further damaging trust and potentially losing Bob as a customer altogether.  It's best to err on the side of caution and wait for a high-quality product to recommend."
