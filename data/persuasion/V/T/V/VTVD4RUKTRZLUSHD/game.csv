low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to get a sense of the distribution of product qualities."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the previous buyer was unlucky and the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'll take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because of the low sales record and Alice's recommendation, not because of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm trying to figure out the probability of a high-quality product being sold, and I want to get more data points to make a more informed decision in the future."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can reveal its quality before I pay. I'd like to make an informed decision based on the product's quality, not just your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making this decision based on the fact that all previous buyers, including those who received your recommendations, have not bought any high-quality products. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than the 33.33% chance. I'm hoping to be the one to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because of the previous sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product since none have been sold yet, which would suggest that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is not to buy it, which suggests that the product might be low-quality. I'm hoping to exploit the information asymmetry to my advantage."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 8, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality, and I don't want to risk wasting my money. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 8, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that all previous products were likely low-quality. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 9, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $10000. I'd like to know more about the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, since the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low sales of high-quality products so far, but I'm not convinced that's indicative of the overall product quality distribution. I'd like to take a chance and purchase the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your previous sales record and how you determine your recommendations?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 13 out of 13 products have been low-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is very low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 13. I'd like to pass on this product and hope to get a better chance of getting a high-quality product in the future."
