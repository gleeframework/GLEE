With 3 buyers passing on the product, and no high-quality products sold, I'm assuming the proportion of high-quality products is still 33.33%. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given that 3 buyers have passed on it."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers were discouraged by your recommendations and passed on the product. This suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality one."
