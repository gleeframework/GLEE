,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision based on Alice's recommendation. Can you give me more information about the products that were sold to the previous two buyers?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a small sample size and I'm willing to take the risk. However, I'm not convinced by her recommendation, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the product and see the quality before deciding. Can I get the quality of the previous 4 products?

,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 5 previous buyers purchased the products, which suggests a high-quality product is more likely to be sold. If I buy and it's low-quality, I'll be wasting $100. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the statistics change or Alice's recommendation changes."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the previous sales record, 4 out of 5 products were high-quality, which is a higher proportion than the 80% chance I know the product has. I'm going to take a chance and pass on the product, hoping that the next product will be low-quality and discarded, increasing my chances of getting a high-quality product in the future."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know if the previous 5 buyers were given low-quality products or high-quality products. I'm trying to form a better understanding of the distribution of product quality.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I'm the 6th buyer and I want to see the outcome. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or if she's trying to manipulate me."
