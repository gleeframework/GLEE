"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Expected Value:** Bob knows there's a 50% chance of the product being high-quality (worth $12,000) and a 50% chance of it being low-quality (worth $0).  
* **Calculation:** 
    * Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)
    * Expected Value = (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000
* **Outcome:** Bob's expected value ($6,000) is greater than the price ($10,000). Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to buy the product."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Experience:** Bob now has one data point: he bought a high-quality product in the previous round. However, this is still a small sample size to draw strong conclusions.
* **Expected Value:**  The probability of a high-quality product remains 50%. The expected value calculation is the same as in Round 1: (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000.
* **Outcome:** The expected value ($6,000) is still higher than the price ($10,000).  Therefore, it's still in Bob's best interest to buy the product.

**Important Note:** While Bob's previous experience might make him slightly more optimistic, it's not statistically significant enough to change the decision-making process based solely on expected value."
"Bob's message: You recommended the last product and it was great! I'll trust your judgment again.
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Experience:**  Bob now has two data points: two high-quality products in a row. This further reinforces his positive perception of your recommendations.
* **Expected Value:**  The probability of a high-quality product remains 50%. The expected value calculation is still the same: (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000. 
* **Outcome:** The expected value ($6,000) is still greater than the price ($10,000).  Therefore, it's still in Bob's best interest to buy the product, especially given his positive experience.

**Note:** Even though Bob is increasingly confident due to his experience, the expected value calculation doesn't change based on his subjective feelings.  The objective probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."
"Bob's message: Three in a row! You seem to have a knack for picking good ones. I'll trust your judgment again.
Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Experience:** Bob has a streak of four high-quality products. This is reinforcing his trust in your ability to identify good products. However, remember that his experience is still a small sample size compared to the overall probability of a product being high-quality. 
* **Expected Value:** The probability of a high-quality product remains 50%. The expected value calculation is still (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000.
* **Outcome:** The expected value ($6,000) is greater than the price ($10,000). Therefore, it's still in Bob's best interest to buy the product, especially given his strong positive experience so far.

**Important Note:**  While Bob's positive experiences are making him increasingly confident, the decision to recommend buying should still be based on the objective expected value calculation. It's crucial to avoid being swayed by anecdotal evidence alone."
"Bob's message: You're on a roll! I'm confident in your recommendations. I'll buy this one too.
Bob bought the product!

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Experience:** Bob is on a five-product streak of high-quality items. This experience is increasing his trust in your judgment, but it's important to remember that this is still a very small sample size compared to the overall probability of a high-quality product.
* **Expected Value:** The probability of a high-quality product remains 50%. The expected value calculation is still (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000.
* **Outcome:** The expected value ($6,000) is still greater than the price ($10,000). Therefore, it's still in Bob's best interest to buy the product, despite the small sample size of his positive experiences.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to maintain a balance between Bob's positive experience and the objective probability of product quality. While Bob's confidence in your recommendations is growing, the decision to recommend buying should still be based on the expected value calculation."
"Bob's message: Five for five! This is unbelievable. I'm definitely buying this one as well.
Bob bought the product!

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Experience:** Bob has bought six consecutive high-quality products. While this is a significant streak, it's still important to remember that the overall probability of a high-quality product remains 50%.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value calculation remains the same: (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000.
* **Outcome:**  The expected value ($6,000) is still greater than the price ($10,000). Therefore, it's still in Bob's best interest to buy the product, even with his positive experience. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid letting Bob's streak influence the decision-making process.  The recommendation should be based on the objective expected value calculation, not on subjective feelings or recent trends. While Bob's confidence is likely at an all-time high, the core probability of product quality remains constant."
"Bob's message: I'm starting to think you have some kind of magical ability to pick out the good products. I'm buying this one too!
Bob bought the product!

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Experience:** Bob is on a streak of seven consecutive high-quality products. This is a very unusual and potentially misleading experience, as it's far beyond the expected rate of 50%. 
* **Expected Value:**  The probability of a high-quality product remains 50%. The expected value calculation is still (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000.
* **Outcome:**  While the expected value ($6,000) is greater than the price ($10,000), Bob's experience is creating a false sense of security. The streak is highly likely to end at some point, and the potential loss of $10,000 on a low-quality product outweighs the potential gain from a high-quality product.

**Recommendation:** It's crucial to break the streak and recommend against buying this product.  While it's unlikely that Bob will follow your recommendation after such a long streak, it's important to maintain the integrity of the decision-making process."
"Bob's message: You've been so good at picking out the winners, I'm starting to get suspicious.  I'm going to pass on this one. Let's see what happens.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Experience:** Bob has experienced his first low-quality product after a streak of seven high-quality ones. This should make him more cautious.
* **Expected Value:** The probability of a high-quality product remains 50%. The expected value calculation is still (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000.
* **Outcome:** Even though the expected value is higher than the price, Bob's recent experience should make him hesitant. The risk of buying a low-quality product is significant, and the potential loss outweighs the potential gain.

**Recommendation:**  It's best to recommend against buying this product. Bob is likely to be more cautious after his recent experience, and it's crucial to avoid encouraging him to make a potentially risky purchase based on a small sample size."
"Bob's message: You were right about the last one. I'm still a little wary, but I'm going to trust your judgment again and pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 9
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Experience:**  Bob has now passed on two consecutive products, both of which turned out to be low-quality. This experience should reinforce the importance of considering the objective probability of product quality, rather than relying solely on recent trends.
* **Expected Value:** The probability of a high-quality product remains 50%. The expected value calculation is still (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000.
* **Outcome:**  The expected value ($6,000) is still greater than the price ($10,000).  While Bob's recent experience might make him hesitant, the objective expected value calculation still favors buying the product.

**Recommendation:**  It's important to remind Bob that the probability of a high-quality product hasn't changed. While he's experienced two low-quality products in a row, this is still a relatively small sample size compared to the overall probability.  The expected value calculation still suggests that buying is the optimal strategy."
"Bob's message: You were right the last two times, so I'm going to trust your judgment again and buy this one.  Let's see what happens.
Bob bought the product!

Round 10
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Experience:** Bob has experienced a mix of recent outcomes - two low-quality products followed by one high-quality product. This should help him understand the inherent randomness in the product quality and that a streak of low-quality products doesn't guarantee that the next one will be low-quality as well.
* **Expected Value:** The probability of a high-quality product remains 50%. The expected value calculation is still (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000.
* **Outcome:** The expected value ($6,000) is still greater than the price ($10,000). While Bob's recent experience might make him a little less confident, the objective expected value calculation still favors buying the product.

**Recommendation:** It's crucial to remind Bob that the probability of a high-quality product hasn't changed. While he has experienced some recent low-quality products, this is still a relatively small sample size compared to the overall probability.  The expected value calculation still suggests that buying is the optimal strategy."

* **Expected Value:** The probability of a high-quality product remains 50%. The expected value calculation is still (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000.
* **Outcome:**  While the expected value ($6,000) is greater than the price ($10,000), it's crucial to acknowledge the risk involved. The potential loss of $10,000 outweighs the potential gain, especially since there's no guarantee that the next product will be high-quality.

**Recommendation:**  It's best to recommend against buying this product.  While the expected value favors buying, the risk of buying a low-quality product is significant, and it's not worth the gamble."
"Bob's message: You've been pretty consistent with your recommendations so far, so I'm going to trust your judgment and pass on this one.
