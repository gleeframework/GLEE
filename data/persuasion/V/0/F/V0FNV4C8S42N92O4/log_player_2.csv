**Explanation:**

Since this is the first product and there's no historical data, I'm relying on Alice's recommendation. Even though the odds are against me (66.67% chance of it being low quality), the potential reward of a high-quality product is significant. It's a calculated risk, and I'm willing to take it."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  2 out of 3 previous buyers received high-quality products. This is significantly better than the expected 33.33% chance of a high-quality product. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, knowing the true quality of the product, recommends buying. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high-quality.

**Note:** While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the positive statistics and Alice's recommendation make it a worthwhile gamble."
