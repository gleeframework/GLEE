Alice's message: This product is a great value at $100. I've sold many similar products to satisfied customers, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this one too. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's worth more than you'll pay for it.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you one bit. I've been burned by my own sales record, and I'm not expecting you to trust me blindly. But I want to be transparent with you - I've sold 8 products now, and 1 of them was high-quality. That means the probability of this one being high-quality is actually... 1/8. Yes, it's a long shot, but I'm willing to take the risk, and I think you should be too. It's only $100, and you might just get lucky!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, Alice.

But I want to offer you a different perspective: what if the first 10 products were just a fluke? What if I've been holding back the good stuff until now? I'm willing to let you in on a little secret: I've been saving this one for someone who's willing to take a chance. It's a top-of-the-line product, and I'm willing to let you have it for the same price as the others - $100. But I'm also willing to make a deal with you: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a refund for the next product you buy from me, no questions asked.
