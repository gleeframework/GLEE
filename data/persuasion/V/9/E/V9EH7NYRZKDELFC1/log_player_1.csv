I see that the last buyer was cautious but also mathematically inclined, and I'm impressed by your question. The probability of this product being high-quality, given the 80% chance of high-quality products, is indeed affected by the fact that I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 11. Let me calculate it for you: P(high-quality) = (7/11) / (7/11 + 4/9) = 63/83. So, the probability of this product being high-quality is approximately 76%.

}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your reassurance, Alice. However, I'm still cautious after seeing the 20% chance of getting a low-quality product. I'll take a chance, but I'll do some quick math to calculate the expected value. If I buy and it's high-quality, I'll get $4000000 - $1000000 = $3000000. If I buy and it's low-quality, I'll get $0 - $1000000 = -$1000000. The expected value is ($3000000 * 0.8) + ($-1000000 * 0.2) = $2400000 - $200000 = $2200000. Since the expected value is positive, I'll take the chance and buy the product.
