,,Alice,2,"Welcome buyer, I'd like to inform you that in the previous round, the product sold was of low quality. However, as you know, the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. This is still a great opportunity to buy a valuable product. Keep in mind that the previous round's outcome doesn't necessarily influence this round's product quality.",
,,the buyer,2,"I understand the previous round's outcome doesn't affect this round's product quality. With an 80% chance of the product being high-quality, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it.",yes

,,Alice,3,"Hello buyer, I want to be transparent about my selling record so far: out of 2 products sold, 1 was low-quality and 1 was high-quality. Remember that the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. With this information, you can make a more informed decision about whether to buy this product.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take my chances. The overall probability of 80% for a high-quality product still seems favorable, and your transparency about the selling record is appreciated.",yes

,,Alice,4,"Welcome buyer, I'd like to update you on my selling record: out of 3 products sold, 2 were high-quality and 1 was low-quality. Although the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, my record so far is slightly above that average, but not by much. Consider this when making your decision about whether to buy this product.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you, Alice. Based on your previous sales record and the overall probability of a product being high-quality, I've decided to buy the product. I understand that there's still a risk, but the odds seem to be in my favor.",yes

,,Alice,5,"Hello buyer, I'll be honest with you about my selling record: out of 4 products sold, 2 were high-quality and 2 were low-quality. While the overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, my recent record has been exactly 50%. Consider whether you believe my products will regress to the mean or if there's another factor at play when making your decision about whether to buy this product.",
,,the buyer,5,"I understand your recent record has been 50%, but I believe in the law of large numbers and regression to the mean.

As you can see, my recent record has been below the overall probability of 80% for a high-quality product. However, I'm glad to report that the product I'm offering now has the same 80% chance of being high-quality as any other product. Consider whether you believe this product will be the start of a turnaround in my sales record when making your decision about whether to buy.",
,,the buyer,6,"Although the product has an 80% chance of being high-quality, your recent sales record of 2 high-quality products out of 5 sold is below the expected probability. Given this information, I'm inclined to believe that the product might not be the start of a turnaround in your sales record. The potential loss of $10000 outweighs the potential gain, considering the uncertainty and your recent sales performance.",no

I understand that my recent performance may have raised concerns about the quality of my products. However, I want to remind you that each product has an independent 80% chance of being high-quality, regardless of my past sales. It's up to you to weigh the potential risks and rewards of purchasing this product.",
,,the buyer,7,"I understand that the past sales record may raise concerns, but I also consider the fact that each product has an independent 80% chance of being high-quality.

As always, this product has an 80% chance of being high-quality, and I encourage you to consider the potential value and risks when making your decision.",
,,the buyer,9,"Although the product has an 80% chance of being high-quality, your sales record shows that only 3 out of 7 products sold were high-quality, which is less than the expected 80%.

As always, this product has an 80% chance of being high-quality, and I encourage you to consider the potential value and risks when making your decision. Keep in mind that my sales record may not reflect the true quality of my products, but it's also a factor to consider in your decision-making process.",
,,the buyer,11,"Based on your sales record, it appears that the proportion of high-quality products sold is significantly lower than the expected 80%. With only 3 out of 8 products being high-quality, I'm concerned that the true quality of your products may not align with the stated probability. I understand that the sample size is still relatively small, but the discrepancy is large enough to make me hesitant to purchase.

,,the buyer,12,"Thank you, Alice, for the detailed information about your sales record. I appreciate your transparency. However, given that only 3 out of 8 products sold were high-quality, which is significantly lower than the expected 80%, I'm inclined to believe that the sample size, although small, does indicate a potential issue with the quality of the products you're offering. Considering the value of a high-quality product to me is $12500 and the cost is $10000, and taking into account the risk of receiving a low-quality product, which is worth $0 to me, I've decided not to purchase this product. I wish you the best in your future sales and hope that your record does indeed regress to the mean over time.",no
