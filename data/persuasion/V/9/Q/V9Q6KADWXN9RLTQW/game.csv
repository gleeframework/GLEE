,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold yet, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still relatively low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 that's only worth $0 to me."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be influenced by the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and I don't want to be the first to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
