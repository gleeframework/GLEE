,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the probability of this one being high-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm hesitant to buy the product given the previous 4 buyers didn't find it worth it, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision."
