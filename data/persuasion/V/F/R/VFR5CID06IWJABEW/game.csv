,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, I don't have any information to go on yet, so I'll just have to take my chances."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious - is there any particular reason you're not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. With only one buyer purchasing and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high quality might be low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to get a better sense of the distribution of product quality, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that Alice does not recommend it, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather pass on it to avoid wasting my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I don't think I should buy it based on your previous recommendations. The fact that you're not recommending it suggests it might be low-quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have rejected high-quality products. If I understand correctly, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. Shouldn't I take the risk and buy the product, considering the potential reward of $400? I'm willing to take a chance, but I'd like to understand your thought process behind the recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me what led you to advise against buying it?
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I think the probability of the current product being high-quality is still relatively low. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by her knowledge of my valuation. I'm hoping to take advantage of her information advantage to get a high-quality product at a discount."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have already been offered the product and none of them bought a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than the 33.33% chance I was initially told. I'll pass on the product."
