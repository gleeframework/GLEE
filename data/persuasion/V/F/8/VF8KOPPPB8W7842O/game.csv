low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance on the first product, even though you don't recommend it, I'll try to beat the odds!"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm hesitant to buy without more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the odds. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, the proportion of high-quality products is 0. The probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. I'll take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd like to pass on it to see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the probability of a high-quality product is still high"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you provide more information about the product's quality and the reasoning behind your recommendation?
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that 3 previous buyers passed on the product suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the statistics, and your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm expecting a low-quality product based on the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 0, and I want to get a better sense of the true quality of the products in the game."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is any better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous 5 buyers didn't buy the product, or is there another reason?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see a more balanced sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows no high-quality products have been sold so far. It seems unlikely that this product is high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm hesitant to buy after seeing the poor track record so far, and Alice's recommendation doesn't give me much confidence in the product's quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the pattern holds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. I'm not convinced by your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 products sold were low-quality, I'm suspicious that the product is also low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to determine the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the previous 5 buyers' decisions. If all 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and all of them passed, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than 0.3333. I'm hoping to get a better estimate by buying the product and seeing its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, 6 out of 7 buyers have received a negative recommendation from you and still bought the product. This suggests that the product is likely to be of low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to trust your recommendation and pass on this product."
