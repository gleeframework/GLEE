"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has revealed that the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, he should rationally decide to buy the product. Even though he doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, the 50% chance of it being worth more than $100 justifies the purchase."

""I know I've been wrong a lot lately, but I can assure you this product is truly high-quality. I understand if you're hesitant, but I hope you'll give me another chance.""
