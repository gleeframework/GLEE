"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality, and Bob knows there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, it's in his best interest to buy. Even though he doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, the potential upside outweighs the potential downside."

Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's decision to pass on the first product, despite it being high-quality, reveals he's risk-averse and likely places a high value on certainty. Since this round also has a high-quality product, recommending purchase is still the best strategy. 

While Bob might pass again, there's no information suggesting he'll *always* pass on high-quality products. We should continue to offer them to him and see if he changes his mind."
