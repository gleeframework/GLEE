high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, which means that the proportion of high-quality products is 1/3. Given that each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, I think the probability of the current product being high-quality is less than 50%. I'd rather not take the risk."
