Alice's message: You're the second buyer. I've sold 1 high-quality product so far. Since you know the probability of getting a high-quality product is 50%, and I've already sold one high-quality product, you can infer that the probability of getting a high-quality product in the next sale is at least 50%. However, I'll give you a hint: I'm more likely to sell a high-quality product now than I was in the first round. If you buy, you'll know whether it's high-quality or not after the purchase.
