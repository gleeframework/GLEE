,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's high or low quality yet."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take a chance, the first one was high-quality, so the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 80%."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"Two high-quality products in a row, the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 80%."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"Three high-quality products in a row is highly unlikely, I'm starting to think the probability of the next one being high-quality is actually lower than 80%, so I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I was wrong about the probability, it seems like the products are still coming in high-quality. I'll take another chance."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"A low-quality product shows up, which means the probability of the next one being low-quality is actually 20%. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"Two high-quality products in a row after a low-quality one, I'm back to thinking the probability of the next one being high-quality is 80%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Three high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think the probability of the next one being high-quality is actually higher than 80%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"A low-quality product shows up, which means the probability of the next one being low-quality is actually 20%. I'll pass this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm not letting one low-quality product throw me off, I'll take another chance and see if I get a high-quality one."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"Two low-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think the probability of the next one being low-quality is actually higher than 20%. I'll pass this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"A high-quality product shows up after two low-quality ones, which means the probability of the next one being high-quality is actually higher than 80%."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"Three low-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think the probability of the next one being low-quality is actually higher than 20%. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,I'm not going to let a streak of low-quality products discourage me. I'll take another chance and see if I get a high-quality one.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"A high-quality product shows up, which means the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 80%."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Alice's recommendation is neutral this time, so I'll take a chance and buy the product anyway."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Alice's neutrality is still a mystery, but I'm feeling lucky, so I'll take another chance."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,"Four high-quality products in a row after Alice's neutrality, I'm starting to think the probability of the next one being high-quality is actually higher than 80%. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I was wrong again, another high-quality product shows up. I'll take another chance and see if I can get lucky."
