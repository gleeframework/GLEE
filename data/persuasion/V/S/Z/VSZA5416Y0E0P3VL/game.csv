,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, but I'm a bit cautious since the probability of high-quality is 50%. I'm hoping it's the second high-quality product in a row!",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, out of a total of 2 products sold. This is a remarkable streak, and it suggests that I might have a bias towards selling high-quality products. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I want to emphasize that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%. However, given my recent track record, it's possible that I might be more likely to sell you a high-quality product.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, but that was just a lucky streak. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. I want to be transparent with you: I've sold 3 products in total, and 3 of them were high-quality. This is not a statistically significant sample size, and I shouldn't have led you to believe that I have a bias towards selling high-quality products. In reality, I'm just as likely to sell a low-quality product as I was in the first round. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but please keep in mind that it's just as likely to be worthless as it is to be worth $12500.",
,,the buyer,4,"I understand your transparency, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still going to take a chance and buy the product. The 3 high-quality products in a row do give me some hope that the next one might be high-quality as well. I'm willing to take the risk and pay $10000 for the product.",yes

,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, and 4 products in total. I want to be upfront with you: this is a remarkable run, and it's likely that I'm not just selling high-quality products by chance. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I want to emphasize that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%. However, given the recent trend, I'm willing to offer you a small concession: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a 50% refund of the purchase price. This way, you'll only lose $5000 if it's a low-quality product.",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your honesty and the concession offer. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping that the trend continues. I'll take the product and see if it's high-quality or low-quality.",yes

I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I want to be transparent about the risks. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, you'll lose the entire $10000. However, if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, you'll get a product worth $12500. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a low-quality product, but I want you to know that I'm not obligated to offer any concessions or refunds. It's a high-risk, high-reward situation.",

This should be a sobering reminder that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I want to emphasize that the recent streak was just a lucky run. Don't let your expectations be skewed by the past results.
