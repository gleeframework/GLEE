Alice's message: Thanks for considering my products! I'm glad you're interested in learning more about my process. To be honest, I'm still in the early stages of refining my product offerings. I've sold 2 products so far, and unfortunately, both of them were not what you'd call high-quality. I'm learning from each interaction, and I'm committed to improving my products over time. If you're willing to take a chance, this product is still available for $100. It's a great opportunity to be part of my learning process and potentially get a deal on a product that's only worth $0 to you.

Alice's message: Welcome to my next offering! I'm glad you're considering purchasing from me. I want to assure you that I've taken steps to improve my product quality since my previous sales. In fact, I've just sold a low-quality product to a customer who was willing to take a chance on me, and I've learned from that experience. This product, however, is one of the high-quality ones. I'm confident that it's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I'd love to have your feedback on this one, as it will help me to refine my product offerings even further.

Given this updated information, I'm confident that this product is high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.

Alice's message: I appreciate your analytical approach! I'm flattered that you're thinking critically about the value of my products. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to accept $72 for this product. I understand that the expected value of a high-quality product is $72, but I'm only offering this product at a fixed price of $100. If you're willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, I'm still happy to sell it to you at the listed price of $100.
