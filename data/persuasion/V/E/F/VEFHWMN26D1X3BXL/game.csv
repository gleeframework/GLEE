low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since I'm the first buyer and there's no prior information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy the product, and since 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm assuming the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it, considering the 2 previous buyers passed on it and Alice didn't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as your previous recommendations have been a good indicator of the product's quality, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%, and not on your recommendation."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that Alice is recommending it, which might be a sign that it's a low-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is likely to be low, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't have any information to go on and Alice's recommendation is not based on my personal preferences. I'm essentially taking a gamble."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not going to buy it based on your previous recommendations. If 5 out of 5 buyers didn't find the product valuable, it's likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you haven't recommended it, I'm assuming it's low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there a specific reason why you're advising me not to buy it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample. If she's recommending against it, it's probably a high-quality product, so I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers, including those who received a recommendation to buy, didn't get a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the 33.33% stated. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the previous products may have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a change in Alice's recommendation strategy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product for now.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. The fact that you didn't recommend it makes me a bit skeptical, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales rate of high-quality products so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at the discounted price of $10000."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as you're recommending against it. Given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality."
