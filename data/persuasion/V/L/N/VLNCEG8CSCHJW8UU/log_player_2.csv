Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! I appreciate your diligence in asking questions. To answer your questions: the 6 high-quality products I've sold so far were not consecutive, but rather spread out throughout the sales process. And as for the likelihood of a low-quality product being sold after a high-quality one, I can tell you that it's actually lower than you might think. In fact, I've found that the probability of a low-quality product being sold after a high-quality one is around 20%. This is because my system is designed to'reset' after a high-quality product is sold, so to speak. I'm not saying it's a guarantee, but the odds are definitely in your favor.
