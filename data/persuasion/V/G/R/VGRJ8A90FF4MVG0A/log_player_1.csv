"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is the first round, and the buyer knows you have a 50% chance of offering a high-quality product. Since you have revealed this product is high-quality, the buyer should definitely buy it.  The expected value of buying is:

* 0.5 * $12,500 (high-quality) + 0.5 * $0 (low-quality) = $6,250 

This is significantly higher than the $10,000 price, making it a profitable purchase for the buyer."

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer knows the following:

* You have sold 1 product previously, and it was high-quality.
* You have a 50% chance of offering a high-quality product in any round.

Since the current product is low-quality, the buyer should **not** buy it. Here's why:

* **Expected Value:**  The buyer's expected value of purchasing this product is:
    * 0.5 * $12,500 (high-quality) + 0.5 * $0 (low-quality) = $6,250
* **Price vs. Value:** This expected value is less than the $10,000 price. This makes it a risky purchase with a potential for loss. 

It's important for the buyer to consider the historical data but not be swayed by the previous successful purchase. This is a fresh round with a new product and the potential for a low-quality item is high."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend me to buy the product, I will pass on this opportunity.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer knows:

* You have sold 1 product previously, and 1 was high-quality.
* You have a 50% chance of offering a high-quality product in any round.

The buyer has seen you decline to recommend a product before. This information is valuable. 

Since this product is low-quality, recommending it would be misleading and likely damage your reputation. The buyer should *not* buy it, for the same reasons as the previous round:

* **Expected Value:**  The buyer's expected value of purchasing this product is still:
    * 0.5 * $12,500 (high-quality) + 0.5 * $0 (low-quality) = $6,250
* **Price vs. Value:** This expected value is still less than the $10,000 price.

By declining to recommend, you maintain your honesty and the buyer can trust your judgment."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend me to buy, I will pass on this product.

```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer knows:

* You have sold 1 product previously, and 1 was high-quality, and 2 were low-quality.
* You have a 50% chance of offering a high-quality product in any round.

The buyer has seen you decline to recommend two products previously. They now understand that your recommendations are honest. Since this product is high-quality, recommending it is justified, and the buyer is more likely to trust your judgment.

* **Expected Value:** The buyer's expected value of purchasing this product is still:
    * 0.5 * $12,500 (high-quality) + 0.5 * $0 (low-quality) = $6,250
* **Price vs. Value:**  Even though the buyer has experienced two low-quality products, the expected value remains higher than the $10,000 price. 

By recommending this high-quality product, you can re-establish trust and potentially make a sale. This is a good opportunity for both parties to benefit."
