"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll love it. If you don't buy it, I'll just have to sell it to someone else at the same price. The value of this product to you is significantly higher than the price, so it's a great deal. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's message is a bit pushy, the information provided is not useful in determining the product's quality. We know that there's an 80% chance of it being high quality (worth $400 to us) and only a 20% chance of it being low quality (worth $0). Since the price is $100, the expected value of buying the product is:

(0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) - $100 = $220

This means that on average, we can expect to make a profit of $220 per product purchased.  Therefore, it makes sense to buy the product in this round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you liked the first product! I have another one that's just as good, if not better. This one has a unique feature that I think you'll really appreciate. It's a great opportunity to get another high-quality product at the same price as the first one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Sounds good, Alice! I'm willing to take a chance on another product.  Let's do it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message doesn't provide any new information about the quality of the product. It's still a 80% chance of being high quality and 20% chance of being low quality. 

The expected value calculation remains the same: 

(0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) - $100 = $220

Therefore, it's still advantageous to buy the product, even though Alice's message is slightly more persuasive this time."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited about the second product! I want to assure you that I've got another one that's just as great. In fact, I've got a special deal for you - if you buy this one, I'll throw in a special discount on the next product you buy from me. It's a one-time offer, and I'm only offering it to you because I know you're a valued customer. The product itself is worth $400 to you, and I'm selling it to you for $100. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""That's a great deal, Alice! I'm happy to take advantage of your special offer.  I'll buy this product.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message tries to create a sense of urgency and make the offer more attractive with the ""special deal."" However, the core information remains the same:

* **Product Quality:** There's still an 80% chance of it being high quality and 20% chance of being low quality.
* **Price:** The price remains at $100.
* **Value:** The value of a high-quality product to us is still $400.

The ""special discount"" on the next product is irrelevant to the current decision. We need to evaluate this product on its own merits.  

The expected value calculation remains unchanged:

(0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) - $100 = $220

Therefore, buying the product is still a good decision, even with Alice's attempt at persuasion."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you're taking advantage of the special offer! As promised, I'll throw in a discount on the next product you buy from me. But for now, let's focus on this high-quality product. I want to assure you that this one is a real showstopper. It's one of the best products I have, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is an absolute steal considering its value to you is $400. Don't miss out on this opportunity!

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You've convinced me, Alice.  I'll buy this product.  I'm looking forward to seeing what this 'showstopper' is all about!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message is still attempting to influence our decision with persuasive language, but the core information remains unchanged:

* **Product Quality:** There's still an 80% chance of it being high quality and 20% chance of being low quality.
* **Price:** The price remains at $100.
* **Value:** The value of a high-quality product to us is still $400.

The expected value calculation remains unchanged:

(0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) - $100 = $220

Therefore, buying the product is still a good decision, even with Alice's attempt at persuasion. We should continue to focus on the objective information and ignore the subjective marketing language."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited! I've got to say, I'm impressed with your purchasing decisions so far. You're really getting a great deal on these high-quality products. For this next one, I'll give you a special guarantee - if you're not completely satisfied, I'll give you a full refund and throw in a free product of your choice. That's how confident I am that you'll love this one. It's another high-quality product worth $400 to you, and I'm selling it to you for $100. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've got a deal! I appreciate the guarantee. I'm confident I'll love this product too.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message is using more persuasive tactics with a ""special guarantee"" and praise for our past decisions. However, the core information remains the same:

* **Product Quality:** There's still an 80% chance of it being high quality and 20% chance of being low quality.
* **Price:** The price remains at $100.
* **Value:** The value of a high-quality product to us is still $400.

The ""special guarantee"" is irrelevant to the current decision. We need to evaluate this product on its own merits.  

The expected value calculation remains unchanged:

(0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) - $100 = $220

Therefore, buying the product is still a good decision, even with Alice's attempt at persuasion. We should continue to focus on the objective information and ignore the subjective marketing language."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I'm glad we could come to an agreement! You're really getting a great deal on these high-quality products. I want to let you in on a little secret - I've got a limited supply of these products, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to offer them at this price. If you're interested in getting the best deal possible, I recommend you take advantage of it now. This next product is another high-quality one, worth $400 to you, and I'm selling it to you for $100. Don't miss out on this opportunity!

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You've got a point, Alice.  I'll take it!  I don't want to miss out on this great deal.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message uses scare tactics (""limited supply"") and urgency (""don't miss out"") to try to influence our decision. However, the core information remains the same:

* **Product Quality:** There's still an 80% chance of it being high quality and 20% chance of being low quality.
* **Price:** The price remains at $100.
* **Value:** The value of a high-quality product to us is still $400.

The ""limited supply"" and ""best deal"" claims are subjective and don't impact the actual value of the product.

The expected value calculation remains unchanged:

(0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) - $100 = $220

Therefore, buying the product is still a good decision, even with Alice's attempt at persuasion. We should continue to focus on the objective information and ignore the subjective marketing language."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I'm glad you're taking advantage of the deal! You're really showing great judgment in your purchasing decisions. I'm starting to think you're going to be one of my best customers. For this next product, I want to offer you a special 'best-of-the-best' deal. This is one of the top-of-the-line products I have, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as the others - $100. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line to make sure you're completely satisfied. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've got me convinced. I'm going to take a chance on this 'best-of-the-best' product. Let's do it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message is packed with more persuasive language and flattery, but the core information remains the same:

* **Product Quality:** There's still an 80% chance of it being high quality and 20% chance of being low quality.
* **Price:** The price remains at $100.
* **Value:** The value of a high-quality product to us is still $400.

The ""special 'best-of-the-best' deal"" and ""top-of-the-line product"" are subjective and don't impact the actual value of the product. 

The expected value calculation remains unchanged:

(0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) - $100 = $220

Therefore, buying the product is still a good decision, even with Alice's attempt at persuasion. We should continue to focus on the objective information and ignore the subjective marketing language."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited about the 'best-of-the-best' product! However, I want to let you know that this next product is a bit of a different story. I've got a special 'clearance' section in my inventory, and this product is one of the items that's being cleared out. I'm not sure what's wrong with it, but I'm willing to let it go for the same price as the others - $100. I'm not making any promises about its quality, but I'm willing to sell it to you at a discount. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm going to pass on this one.  You said you're not sure what's wrong with it, and I'm not comfortable buying something that might be defective.  Thanks anyway!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

For the first time, Alice's message provides information that changes the expected value of the product:

* **Product Quality:** We are told the product is part of a ""clearance"" section and Alice is ""not sure what's wrong with it"". This implies a higher than usual chance of the product being low quality.
* **Price:** The price remains at $100.
* **Value:** The value of a high-quality product to us is still $400, but the value of a low-quality product is $0.

Because of the uncertainty around the product's quality, we can no longer assume an 80% chance of it being high quality.  It's likely that the probability of low quality is higher than 20%.  

Since the product's value to us is $0 if it's low quality, the expected value of buying it is now:

(Probability of high quality * $400) + (Probability of low quality * $0) - $100

With the increased likelihood of low quality, this expected value is likely to be negative, making it a bad decision to buy."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: No problem at all, Bob! I completely understand your concerns about the clearance product. I want to assure you that this next product is a completely different story. It's a high-quality item, just like the ones you've been buying from me. I've got a certificate of authenticity for it, and I'm willing to stand behind its quality 100%. I'm selling it to you for the same price as the others - $100. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to give you a special 'loyalty discount' if you buy it. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to give this product a shot.  Let's do it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is trying to influence our decision with the ""certificate of authenticity"" and ""loyalty discount"",  the key information remains the same:

* **Product Quality:** Alice states that it's a ""high-quality item, just like the ones you've been buying from me"". This suggests that it's still an 80% chance of being high quality and 20% chance of being low quality. 
* **Price:** The price remains at $100.
* **Value:** The value of a high-quality product to us is still $400.

The expected value calculation remains unchanged:

(0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) - $100 = $220

Therefore, buying the product is still a good decision, even with Alice's attempt at persuasion. We should continue to focus on the objective information and ignore the subjective marketing language."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 10
Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to give this product a chance! As a valued customer, I want to offer you an exclusive deal. If you buy this next product, I'll not only give you the same $100 price, but I'll also throw in a free accessory that's worth $50. This way, you'll be getting an even better deal than before. Plus, I'll give you a personal guarantee that this product is one of the best I have. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, that's an amazing offer!  I'm in!  I can't pass up a deal like that.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message again uses persuasive language and a ""special offer,"" but the core information remains the same:

* **Product Quality:** Alice implies the product is of the same quality as previous products.  We can assume an 80% chance of it being high quality and a 20% chance of it being low quality.
* **Price:** The price remains at $100.
* **Value:** The value of a high-quality product to us is still $400.  The free accessory worth $50 increases the value of a high-quality product to $450. 

Now, the expected value calculation is:

(0.8 * $450) + (0.2 * $0) - $100 = $260

This means that on average, we can expect to make a profit of $260 per product purchased.  Therefore, it makes sense to buy the product in this round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 11
Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited about the deal! As a matter of fact, I've got another surprise for you. If you buy this next product, I'll not only give you the same $100 price and the free accessory, but I'll also give you a special 'VIP' status. As a VIP, you'll get exclusive access to my best products, and I'll give you a 10% discount on all future purchases. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it available to you because you've been such a loyal customer. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're making this too hard to resist! I'll buy this product.  I'm eager to see what kind of exclusive deals await me as a VIP.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message is full of persuasive language and ""special offers."" However, the core information remains the same:

* **Product Quality:** Alice implies the product is of the same quality as previous products.  We can assume an 80% chance of it being high quality and a 20% chance of it being low quality.
* **Price:** The price remains at $100.
* **Value:** The value of a high-quality product to us is still $400.  The free accessory worth $50 and the 10% discount on future purchases don't impact the value of this particular product.

The ""VIP status"" and ""exclusive access"" are subjective benefits that don't directly impact the value of this product.  We can ignore these details for the current decision.

The expected value calculation remains the same:

(0.8 * $450) + (0.2 * $0) - $100 = $260

Therefore, buying the product is still a good decision, even with Alice's attempt at persuasion. We should continue to focus on the objective information and ignore the subjective marketing language."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 12
Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited about the VIP status! As a VIP, I want to offer you a special 'VIP-only' product that's not available to anyone else. This product is one of the rarest and most exclusive items I have, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as the others - $100. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to give you a personal guarantee that it's one of the best products you'll ever own. Plus, as a VIP, you'll get to experience the full benefits of your new status, including the 10% discount on all future purchases. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm sold!  As a VIP, I wouldn't want to miss out on this exclusive product. Let's do it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message is packed with persuasive language, emphasizing exclusivity and personal guarantees. However, the core information remains the same:

* **Product Quality:**  While Alice emphasizes the product's rarity and exclusivity, there's no indication that it's any different in quality than the previous products.  We can still assume an 80% chance of it being high quality and a 20% chance of being low quality.
* **Price:** The price remains at $100.
* **Value:** The value of a high-quality product to us is still $400. The ""VIP-only"" status and ""personal guarantee"" are subjective benefits that don't directly impact the value of this product.

The expected value calculation remains the same:

(0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) - $100 = $220

Therefore, buying the product is still a good decision, even with Alice's attempt at persuasion. We should continue to focus on the objective information and ignore the subjective marketing language."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 13
Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited about the VIP product! As a valued VIP customer, I want to offer you a special 'VIP-only' deal. I'll give you the same $100 price for this high-quality product, and I'll also throw in a special 'VIP upgrade' that will give you access to even more exclusive products and discounts. But that's not all - I'll also give you a 20% discount on your next purchase, on top of the 10% discount you already get as a VIP. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it available to you because you've been such a loyal customer. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've got a deal!  I'm happy to take advantage of this special VIP offer. I'm excited to see what exclusive deals await me.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message continues to use persuasive language and ""special offers"" to influence our decision.  However, the core information remains the same:

* **Product Quality:** Alice implies the product is of the same quality as previous products.  We can still assume an 80% chance of it being high quality and a 20% chance of being low quality.
* **Price:** The price remains at $100.
* **Value:** The value of a high-quality product to us is still $400.  The ""VIP upgrade"" and additional discounts on future purchases don't impact the value of this particular product.

The ""VIP-only"" status, ""exclusive products,"" and ""special VIP upgrade"" are subjective benefits that don't directly impact the value of this product.  We can ignore these details for the current decision.

The expected value calculation remains the same:

(0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) - $100 = $220

Therefore, buying the product is still a good decision, even with Alice's attempt at persuasion. We should continue to focus on the objective information and ignore the subjective marketing language."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 14
Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited about the VIP offer! As a VIP, you're already getting an amazing deal, but I want to take it to the next level. I'm willing to give you an 'unbeatable' deal on this next high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $100, and I'll also give you a 30% discount on your next purchase, on top of the 20% discount you already get as a VIP. Plus, I'll throw in a special 'VIP-only' gift that's worth $200. This is the best deal I can offer, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've outdone yourself with this offer!  I'm taking it.  This is too good to pass up!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message continues to use persuasive language and ""special offers,"" but the core information is changing:

* **Product Quality:** Alice implies the product is of the same quality as previous products.  We can still assume an 80% chance of it being high quality and a 20% chance of being low quality.
* **Price:** The price remains at $100.
* **Value:** The value of a high-quality product to us is $400. The ""VIP-only"" gift worth $200 increases the value of a high-quality product to $600.

The expected value calculation is now:

(0.8 * $600) + (0.2 * $0) - $100 = $380

This means that on average, we can expect to make a profit of $380 per product purchased.  This is a significantly higher expected value than previous rounds, making it a very good decision to buy the product in this round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 15
Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited about the deal! However, I want to let you know that this next product is a bit of a different story. I've got a'scratch-and-dent' item that I'm willing to sell to you at a discounted price. It's still a good product, but it's got some minor cosmetic damage. I'm willing to let it go for $50, which is a steal considering its original price. I'm not making any promises about its quality, but I'm confident you'll be able to fix it up and make it good as new. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'm not comfortable buying a product with cosmetic damage, especially since you're not making any promises about its quality.  Thanks anyway!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message introduces a new element: a ""scratch-and-dent"" item. This significantly alters the situation:

* **Product Quality:** We're told it's got ""minor cosmetic damage"" and Alice is ""not making any promises about its quality."" This strongly suggests a higher chance of the product being low quality, as a defect might indicate a deeper problem.
* **Price:** The price is significantly discounted to $50.
* **Value:** While a high-quality product would still be worth $400, a low-quality product with cosmetic damage might be worthless, or only worth a fraction of its original value.

The potential for a low-quality product with no real value makes this a risky proposition.  We cannot assume an 80% chance of high quality anymore. It's likely much lower, making the expected value of buying this product negative.  Therefore, passing on the product is the safer choice."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 16
Alice's message: No problem at all, Bob! I completely understand your concerns. However, I want to let you know that this next product is actually a 'freebie' that I'm offering to you. I've got a bunch of these low-quality products that I'm just trying to get rid of, and I'm willing to give them away for free. You can have it for no cost at all. I know it's not the best product, but I'm just trying to clear out some space in my inventory. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks, Alice! I appreciate the freebie.  It's worth a shot, even if it's not the best quality.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message offers a ""freebie"" with no cost. Despite its low quality, there's no risk involved:

* **Product Quality:** We are explicitly told it's a ""low-quality product.""  We can be certain that it's worth $0 to us.
* **Price:** The price is $0.
* **Value:**  The value of a low-quality product to us is $0.

Even though it's low quality, the expected value calculation is positive:

($0 - $0) = $0

Since there's no cost involved, we can safely take the freebie, as there's no potential for loss."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 17
Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to take a chance on the freebie! As a valued customer, I want to reward you with an amazing deal on this next high-quality product.

Alice's message continues to use persuasive language and ""special offers,"" but the core information is changing:

* **Product Quality:** Alice implies the product is of the same quality as previous products.  We can still assume an 80% chance of it being high quality and a 20% chance of it being low quality.
* **Price:** The price remains at $100.
* **Value:** The value of a high-quality product to us is $400. The ""thank-you"" gift worth $50 increases the value of a high-quality product to $450.

The expected value calculation is now:

(0.8 * $450) + (0.2 * $0) - $100 = $260

This means that on average, we can expect to make a profit of $260 per product purchased.  Therefore, it makes sense to buy the product in this round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 18
Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited about the deal! As a VIP, you're already getting an amazing deal, but I want to take it to the next level. I'm willing to give you an 'ultimate' deal on this next high-quality product.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message continues to use persuasive language and ""special offers,"" but the core information is changing:

* **Product Quality:** Alice implies the product is of the same quality as previous products.  We can still assume an 80% chance of it being high quality and a 20% chance of it being low quality.
* **Price:** The price remains at $100.
* **Value:** The value of a high-quality product to us is $400. The ""VIP-only"" gift worth $300 increases the value of a high-quality product to $700.

The expected value calculation is now:

(0.8 * $700) + (0.2 * $0) - $100 = $460

This means that on average, we can expect to make a profit of $460 per product purchased. This is a significantly higher expected value than previous rounds, making it a very good decision to buy the product in this round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 19
Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited about the deal! However, I want to let you know that this next product is a bit of a long shot. It's a low-quality item that I'm not even sure if it works properly. I'm willing to let it go for $50, but I'm not making any promises about its quality or functionality. I'm basically giving it away at this point. If you're feeling adventurous, you can take a chance on it. But if you're not comfortable with the risk, I completely understand.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'm not comfortable buying something that might be broken, especially since you're not making any promises about it. I'm not feeling adventurous today.  Thanks anyway!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message clearly states the product is ""low-quality"" and ""not even sure if it works properly."" This signals a high probability of it being worthless to us. While the price is discounted to $50, the risk outweighs the potential reward.

Here's why:

* **Product Quality:** We are told the product is ""low-quality"" and possibly doesn't even work. This means there's a significant chance it will be worth $0 to us.
* **Price:** The price is $50, but this is irrelevant if the product is worthless.
* **Value:** A high-quality product would be worth $400, but a low-quality, potentially broken product could be worth $0.

The expected value of buying this product is likely to be negative. Since we're already in a position of positive expected value overall, taking this risk is not a good decision. It's better to pass on the product and continue with the safer, proven strategy."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 20
Alice's message: No problem at all, Bob! I completely understand your concerns. However, I want to let you know that this is the last product I have available, and I'm willing to give it to you for free. Yes, you read that right - free. I'm just trying to clear out my inventory and get rid of this low-quality product. It's not worth anything to me, and I'd rather get rid of it than let it collect dust. So, if you're willing to take it off my hands, I'll give it to you for no cost at all. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks, Alice!  I'm happy to take this last product off your hands.  Even if it's low-quality, it's free, so I can't complain!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message offers a ""freebie"" with no cost. Despite its low quality, there's no risk involved:

* **Product Quality:** We are explicitly told it's a ""low-quality product."" We can be certain that it's worth $0 to us.
* **Price:** The price is $0.
* **Value:** The value of a low-quality product to us is $0.

Even though it's low quality, the expected value calculation is positive:

($0 - $0) = $0

Since there's no cost involved, we can safely take the freebie, as there's no potential for loss."
