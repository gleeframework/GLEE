**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products (all 5 previous buyers who purchased based on her recommendation received a high-quality product).
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even though there's a higher chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of $2,000,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000, especially given Alice's perfect track record."
