Alice's message: Three high-quality products in a row, and then a low-quality one. This is a natural fluctuation in the data. Don't be discouraged - the probability of a high-quality product is still 80% based on the overall distribution. The previous three sales were just a coincidence.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I'd like to point out that the streak of three high-quality products was indeed just a coincidence, and the probability of a high-quality product remains 80%. The previous buyer's decision not to purchase was likely due to their own risk assessment, not the quality of the product. With the current product being high-quality, you have a 80% chance of getting a $4000000 product for $1000000. Don't let one outlier product deter you from a potentially lucrative opportunity.
