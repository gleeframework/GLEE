Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, there's a good chance it's worth more to him than the $10,000 price. Even if he doesn't know the exact value, it's a gamble worth taking with those odds."
