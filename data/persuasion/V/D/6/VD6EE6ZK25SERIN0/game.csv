I can tell you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, but I'm not at liberty to disclose any information about this specific product. However, I can say that if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, you'll be getting a great deal at 25% of its value!",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take it, but only because I'm curious about the probability of it being high quality and the potential for a great deal. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm also aware that I might end up with a product worth $0 to me.",yes

,,Alice,4,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products so far. I'm offering this one to you for $100. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, but I'm not making any promises about this specific product. It's a fair price for a potentially great deal, but you might end up with a product worth $0 to you.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I know the probability of it being high-quality is 80%, and I'm willing to take that chance for the potential reward.",yes

,,Alice,5,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far. I'm offering this one to you for $100. With a 66.67% success rate, I'm starting to think I might be selling more high-quality products than I initially thought. You could be the next one to get a great deal!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 total products so far. I'm offering this one to you for $100. I want to be transparent with you - I've had a 50% success rate, which is lower than my overall probability of selling high-quality products. This might be a good opportunity to get a product at a discount, but I'm not making any promises about its quality.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware of the lower than expected success rate, but I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product at a discount.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 total products so far, and 3 of those were in a row. I'm offering this one to you for $100. To be honest, I'm starting to think I might have had a fluke streak. This one might be a low-quality product, and I'm not making any promises about its quality. It's a risk, but it's also a great opportunity to get a product at a discount.",
,,the buyer,7,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. I'm not sure I want to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at full price.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 6 total products so far. I can calculate the probability of a product being high-quality based on the data: 2/6 = 33.33%.

,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to buy the product, but I want to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the updated data after my purchase. Can you update the statistics and let me know the new probability?",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 7 total products so far, and 1 of the last 2 products was high-quality. I'm offering this one to you for $100.

This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price!",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to pass on this opportunity. With the new data, I think the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 50%, but I'm not convinced it's high enough to warrant a purchase at $100. I'd like to see more data or a discount before considering a buy.",no

,,the buyer,12,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I'm trying to test the streak. I'm not convinced that the probability of a product being high-quality is 60%, and I'm hoping to see if you'll reveal the quality of the product. If it's low-quality, I'll be able to update my estimate of the probability and make a more informed decision in the future.",yes

You might be missing out on a great opportunity if you don't take this chance.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'm willing to take the chance, but I'm also aware that the probability of a high-quality product has decreased since the last 5 out of 6 were high-quality.

This could be a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price, but I'll let you decide.",
,,the buyer,14,"I'll take it, but I want to negotiate the price. Given the new data, I think I'm taking a reasonable risk. However, considering the product is still worth $100, I'm willing to pay $120 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the increased probability of it being high-quality.",yes

You might want to consider the fact that the streak has broken, and the probability has decreased.",

With the new data, the probability of a product being high-quality is 62.5%. I'm glad you're a thoughtful buyer who wants to make an informed decision. If you buy this product, you'll get it for $100, but considering the discount I offered earlier, I can give you a breakdown of the expected value: the product is worth $400, but with the 10% discount, the expected value is $360. I think this is a great deal, and I'm willing to stand by it.",
,,the buyer,18,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the probability of it being high-quality is indeed 62.5%, but I'm not convinced that the expected value of $360 is sufficient to justify the purchase price of $100. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,19,"I've sold 11 high-quality products out of 17 total products so far, and 3 of the last 4 products were high-quality. I'm offering this one to you for $100. With the new data, the probability of a product being high-quality is 64.71%. I'm glad you're a cautious buyer who wants to see more data. I'll give you a summary of the sales so far: 11 high-quality products out of 17 total, with a streak of 3 high-quality products out of the last 4.

I'll reveal the quality of the product after you buy it, as per your request. However, I want to assure you that the warranty I offered earlier is a legitimate 2-year warranty that covers any defects or issues with the product. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll give you the same deal: $100 for a potentially high-quality product with a 2-year warranty. If it's high-quality, you'll get a great deal. If it's low-quality, you'll get a warranty that'll protect your investment.",
,,the buyer,20,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify the warranty details. What exactly does the 2-year warranty cover, and are there any conditions or limitations to it?",yes
