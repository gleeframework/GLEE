"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High-Quality Product:**  The product is high-quality, meaning it is worth $200 to the buyer.
* **Price vs. Value:** The buyer is getting a product worth $200 for only $100. This is a significant gain. 
* **Lack of Information:**  The buyer has no information about the specific product's quality. However, they know the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a 20% chance the product is low-quality, the potential reward of getting a high-quality product for half its value outweighs the risk. 

Therefore, recommending the purchase is the best strategy."

* **Positive Signal:** The previous round's success strengthens the buyer's confidence in the seller's ability to provide high-quality goods. 
* **No Further Information:** The buyer still lacks specific information about this round's product, but the positive outcome from the previous round increases the perceived likelihood of this round's product also being high-quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even with the 20% chance of the product being low-quality, the positive outcome from Round 1 makes the potential reward (getting a high-quality product for $100) more appealing.

**Explanation:**

* **Shifting Dynamics:**  While the seller has an excellent track record (5 consecutive high-quality products), this round's product is **low-quality**.

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward for the seller is minimal (only $100) and the risk of losing future buyers due to a damaged reputation is high.

Therefore, it is best to **not** recommend the purchase in this round, even though the buyer may be expecting another high-quality product."
