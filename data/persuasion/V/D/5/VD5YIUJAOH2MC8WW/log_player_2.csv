The price is $10000, a small fraction of its true value. I've sold many of these products in the past, and I'm sure you'll be thrilled with your purchase. What do you say? Will you take it home today?

Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! If I had sold a high-quality product to the previous buyer, I would have sold it to them for $10000, just like I'm offering this one. But since it was a low-quality product, I'm willing to let this one go for the same price. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that might be just what you're looking for.

Alice's message: I'm glad you took a chance on the last product! Unfortunately, it seems I've got another one that's not quite as valuable. I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm willing to let you have it for $10000. I'm not making any promises, but I'm hoping you'll be able to get a good deal on it. Maybe you'll be the one to turn things around for me!

Still, the price is $10000, and you might be able to get a good deal on it. But if you're looking for a high-quality product, I'd advise you to keep looking.

Alice's message: Ah, a new chance to turn things around! I'm glad you're interested in this one. I'll let you in on a secret: I've sold a total of 5 products so far, with 1 high-quality one (the one you just saw) and 3 low-quality ones. That's a 20% chance of getting a high-quality product, which is actually lower than the 33.33% chance I told you about at the beginning. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000, but I think it's worth so much more. What do you say?

Alice's message: I don't blame you for being cautious! With the stats looking like they do, it's a tough sell. But I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm not getting any younger, and I really need to move some of these products out the door. I'll tell you what - I'll let you have this one for $5000, the same price the last buyer offered. It's a steal, if you ask me!

Alice's message: I don't blame you for being cautious. To be honest, I'm not sure what's going on with the low-quality products either. I've been in the business a long time, and I've never had a streak like this before. I've checked the inventory, and everything seems to be in order. I've even had the products inspected by a third-party expert, and they all passed with flying colors. I'm starting to think that maybe I just got a bad batch or something. But hey, you're not here to solve my problems, you're here to buy a product. And this one is still $5000, the same price as before.
