Alice's message: You're the third buyer in a row to take a chance on me! I appreciate your confidence. However, I must inform you that the odds I offered in the last round were a bit... optimistic. Let's be realistic - we've sold 2 products so far, and neither was high-quality. I'm not going to sugarcoat it: the probability of this product being high-quality is likely lower than 50%. I'll give you a more conservative estimate: 20%. The price remains the same at $1000000. Are you still willing to take the risk?
