,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. I'm a reputable seller, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and I'm looking for a serious buyer who will appreciate this unique opportunity. The price is $1000000, a fraction of its true value. Are you interested in making a great deal?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I understand that it's the first product and there's no prior data to rely on, but I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second product! I see you're a savvy buyer who's aware of the risks. I'll give you some context: we've had 2 products sold so far, and none of them were high-quality. I'm willing to offer you a special deal - I'll give you a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product. The price remains the same at $1000000. What do you say?",

,,Alice,3,"You're the third buyer in a row to take a chance on me! I appreciate your confidence. However, I must inform you that the odds I offered in the last round were a bit... optimistic. Let's be realistic - we've sold 2 products so far, and neither was high-quality. I'm not going to sugarcoat it: the probability of this product being high-quality is likely lower than 50%. I'll give you a more conservative estimate: 20%. The price remains the same at $1000000. Are you still willing to take the risk?",
,,the buyer,3,I'm not willing to take the risk at a 20% chance of being high-quality. I'd rather pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity.,no

I want to assure you that I'm a reliable seller, and I've been transparent about the quality of my previous products. Now, I'm offering a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. The price is $1000000, but I'm willing to make a special offer: I'll give you a 10% discount for being one of my valued customers. That brings the price down to $900000. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm not convinced by your guarantee of a high-quality product, and I'm not willing to pay $900000 without knowing the product's quality. I'd like to wait and see if you can provide more information or a different product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. I'll give you a more detailed breakdown of my sales record. So far, I've sold 3 products, and none of them were high-quality. I've sold 1 product that was high-quality, which is the one in Round 4. I'm not trying to mislead you - I'm just trying to make a sale. The price remains the same at $1000000. I'll give you a simple question: do you think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%?",

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your willingness to do your due diligence. I'll provide you with a more transparent overview of my sales process.

However, I do have a system in place to ensure that high-quality products are more likely to be offered to you, the buyer. I'll give you a statistic: since the beginning, I've offered 6 products, and 2 of them have been high-quality. That's a 33.33% success rate, which is in line with my average. The price remains the same at $1000000. Would you like to take a chance on this high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. I'll take a chance on this product. I'm willing to take the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, considering the price is $1000000. I'll buy the product and hope it's high-quality.",yes

Out of the 7 products I've offered, 3 of them have been high-quality, and 4 of them have been low-quality. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is actually lower than 33.33%. I'll give you a more conservative estimate: 25%. The price remains the same at $1000000. Are you willing to take the risk?",
