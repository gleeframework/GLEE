I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100, but I want to be upfront with you - it's not going to be a game-changer. It's more of a 'nice-to-have' item, and I think you'll get more value out of it if you're looking for a novelty rather than a high-impact solution. What do you think?""
}"

I'm not expecting you to get the same level of satisfaction as with some of my other products, but I think this one could still be a solid addition to your collection.

}"
"Bob's message: Considering the discount and the potential for some value and utility, I think it's worth taking the chance. The lower price point makes the risk more manageable, and I'm willing to explore new options even if they don't guarantee a high return.

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I'm glad you're feeling open to new opportunities! However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is actually one of my lowest-quality items. I'm not even sure why I have it in stock, to be honest. But, I'm willing to let it go for an even lower price: $60. It's essentially a 'clearance item', and I'm just looking to get rid of it. If you're feeling adventurous, you can have it for a steal.""
}"

  ""message"": ""I completely understand your priorities, and I respect your decision-making process. However, I want to make one more offer to you. This product is not only a low-quality item, but it's also a bit of a hassle to deal with. I'm willing to give you an 'as-is' deal, where you can have it for $50, but I'm not providing any warranty or support. It's essentially a 'take it or leave it' situation.

}"

It's not the best product, but it's a way for you to help me declutter my inventory and get a small reward in return.""
}"

I'm not expecting you to get much value out of the product itself, but I think the bag of miscellaneous items might be worth something to you. What do you say?""
}"
