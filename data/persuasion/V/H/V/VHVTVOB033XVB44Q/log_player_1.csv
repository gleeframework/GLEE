I'm not making any promises about its value to you, but I think it's a good opportunity to get a deal on something that might be valuable to you.""
}"

}"
"Bob's message: I'm not sure why this product would be more valuable than the previous one, but I'm not willing to pay $1800000 for a product that is already worth $2000000 to me. I'm happy with the previous purchase and don't see the need to spend more money on a potentially similar product.

}"

If you're not interested, I'll just have to deal with the consequences. But if you're feeling generous, I'll sell it to you for $50,000. It's a steal, and I'm practically giving it away.""

You'll essentially get a $2,000,000 product for $1,000,000, with no risk. Is that a deal you're willing to consider?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in the deal, Alice. I already know that high-quality products are worth $2000000 to me, so I'm not getting a good deal even with the guarantee. I'd be paying $1000000 for a product that I already know I can get for $1000000 without the guarantee.

I'm willing to make one final offer: I'll give it to you for $1. Yes, just $1. It's a token amount, and I'm not expecting you to pay it. I just want to get it off my hands and move on. If you're willing to take it, I'll consider it a blessing.""
