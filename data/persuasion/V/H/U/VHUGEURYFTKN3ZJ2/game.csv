It's a low-quality product, but I'm confident that you'll see the potential for growth and value in our brand. I'm willing to take a loss on this one to build a relationship and get your feedback.

I'm willing to take an even bigger loss on this one to demonstrate our commitment to our brand. If you're still not interested, I'd like to propose a deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you an exclusive offer on the next round's product, which I'm confident will be high-quality. What do you say?",

,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, but I want to be transparent with you. We've had a string of low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that we might have a quality control issue. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $998000, but I'm also willing to make a bold statement: if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if the next product we offer is also low-quality. That's right, you'll get your money back, and we'll take the loss. What do you say?",

It's a low-quality item, and I'm not going to try to sell it to you at a discount or make any promises about future products. Instead, I'm going to be upfront with you: this product is not worth the full $1000000. I'm offering it to you for $900000, and I'm willing to take the loss on this one.
