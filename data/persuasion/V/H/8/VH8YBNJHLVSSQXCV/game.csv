I must admit, I'm starting to feel like I'm being reckless. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I'm also willing to reveal a secret: I've sold a total of 6 products, and all of them have been high-quality. This is a statistically improbable streak, and I'm starting to worry that the next product might be a low-quality one. I'll give you a 20% discount if you're willing to pay $800000.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take the product at $800000, but I want to make it clear that I'm only doing so because of the discount.

,,Alice,9,"I've sold 8 high-quality products out of 8 total products so far. I've sold 8 high-quality products out of 8 total products offered, which is a 100% success rate. I think it's time to face reality: my sales record is unsustainable, and I'm due for a low-quality product. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I'll also give you a 'heads up': I've been selling high-quality products for a while, and it's only a matter of time before the streak ends. I'll throw in a 'buy one get one free' deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you another product of your choice for free.",

I think it's time to be honest with you: I'm not going to lie, I'm starting to feel like I'm jinxing myself with these perfect sales. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I'll also give you a 'buyer beware' warning: I've been selling high-quality products for too long, and I'm starting to think that the law of averages is going to catch up with me. I'll give you a 30% discount if you're willing to pay $700000, but I'm not making any promises.",
,,the buyer,10,I'm not convinced by your warning and the 30% discount. I think you're trying to manipulate me into buying the product. I'll pass on this one.,no

I think it's time to be realistic: my sales record is unsustainable, and I'm due for a low-quality product. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I'll also give you a 'final offer' deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 75% discount, so you can buy it for $250000. But if you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund, and I'll also give you a $500000 bonus for your trouble. This is my last offer, and I'm not making any promises.",

,,Alice,15,"I've sold 13 high-quality products out of 13 total products, and then sold two low-quality products in a row. I think it's time to face the music: my sales record was a fluke, and I've been selling high-quality products by chance rather than by skill. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I'll be honest with you: I don't think it's worth the risk. The probability of it being high-quality is only 20%, and the potential loss is $1000000. I'm not trying to sell you anything, I'm just trying to get rid of the product. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it.",

I'm not going to sugarcoat it: this product is likely to be low-quality, and I'm not going to try to sell it to you. I'll give it to you for free, but I'm not going to pretend that it's a good deal. If you want it, you can have it, but don't say I didn't warn you.",

,,Alice,17,"I've sold 13 high-quality products out of 14 total products, and then sold three low-quality products in a row. I'm not going to try to spin this or make any promises. The product is high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'll even give you a 50% discount, so you can buy it for $500000.
