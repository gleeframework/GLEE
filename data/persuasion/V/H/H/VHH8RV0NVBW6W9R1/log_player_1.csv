"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since this is the first round, the buyer has no information about your past sales record.  They only know that:

* There's an 80% chance the product is high-quality.
* A high-quality product is worth $1,200,000.
* A low-quality product is worth $0.

The potential profit from a high-quality product ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000 = $200,000) far outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product. Therefore, it's in the buyer's best interest to buy."
