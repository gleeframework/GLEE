"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation. I'll pass on this one.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **No recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is not helpful, as she doesn't know the product's value to you.
* **Risk assessment:** Since the product has a 20% chance of being low-quality, and a low-quality product is worth nothing to you, it's too risky to buy.
* **Passing:** Passing allows you to avoid potential losses and potentially get a better offer in future rounds."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product, while not guaranteed, does provide a slight edge in this round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($4,000,000) outweighs the risk.
* **Previous round:**  The fact that the previous product was low-quality doesn't change the odds for this round; each product is an independent event."

* **Previous success:**  The fact that you just bought a high-quality product for a great profit further strengthens the belief that Alice's recommendations might be valuable.

* **Previous success:**  You've now bought two high-quality products in a row, further indicating that Alice's recommendations might have some predictive power.

```

* **Previous success:** Nine consecutive high-quality products have made Alice's recommendations seem almost magical. The pattern is so strong that it's hard to believe it would change.
* **Risk assessment:** While the risk of a low-quality product is still present, the previous pattern makes this round highly risky. It's better to be cautious and wait to see if Alice's recommendations continue to be accurate. 

The sudden shift in recommendations after such a strong track record creates a significant change in the risk-reward balance. It's prudent to wait and observe before making a decision, as the pattern might have shifted."

Round 11
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one.  Your streak was impressive, but I'm not sure what's going on now.  I'll see what happens in the next few rounds.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice continues to not recommend the product, which reinforces the shift in pattern.
* **Previous success & failure:** The previous round's low-quality product, combined with Alice's lack of recommendation in this round, suggests a change in her ability to predict high-quality products.
* **Risk assessment:**  While the potential reward of a high-quality product is still enticing, the recent change in pattern makes this round a high-risk gamble. It's better to err on the side of caution and wait for more information.  

At this point, the strategy is to wait and observe to see if Alice's recommendations become reliable again. If her predictions are accurate in the next few rounds, you can consider buying again.  However, if the pattern continues to be unreliable, it might be better to avoid buying any more products from her."

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, suggesting a possible return to her previous pattern. 
* **Recent inconsistency:**  However, the last two rounds have demonstrated a significant change in her predictive ability, making her current recommendation less trustworthy. 
* **Risk assessment:** The risk of a low-quality product is high, as Alice's recent track record is unpredictable. It's best to wait for more evidence of a return to her previous accuracy before taking a gamble. 

While Alice's recommendation is promising, the recent inconsistency in her predictions makes it a risky bet. It's better to continue observing for a few more rounds to see if the pattern stabilizes."

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product again, indicating a potential return to her previous pattern of accuracy.
* **Recent inconsistency:** The previous round's high-quality product, despite Alice's recommendation, could be a sign of returning accuracy.

The recent mixed pattern makes this round a gamble, but it's a gamble worth taking. If Alice's recommendations are accurate again, you could reap the rewards. If not, you'll learn more about her current capabilities."
