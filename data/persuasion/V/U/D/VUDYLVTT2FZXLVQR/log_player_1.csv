That's a 100% return on investment, if you will. It's a chance to break even, and potentially even make a profit if you sell the product on to someone else. It's a risk, but it's also an opportunity to get a great deal on a product that's not going to cost you anything.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your perspective, Alice, but I'm not convinced. With a 25% chance of a high-quality product, I'd rather wait for more information.
