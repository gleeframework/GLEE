It's a good representation of the quality you can expect from our products. However, I want to be upfront with you - it's not the best model we have. If you're still interested in purchasing this one, I can offer it to you for $1000000, but I want to reiterate that it's not the top-of-the-line product. If you'd rather wait for the second product, I completely understand.""
