Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

Since the product is low-quality and Bob knows that there's a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, it's not worth the risk. A low-quality product is worth $0 to Bob, and the price is $10,000."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

This is the first time Bob is being offered a high-quality product. Even though he doesn't know it's high-quality, the potential reward of $12,500 (the value of a high-quality product) significantly outweighs the $10,000 cost. Bob has nothing to lose by trying this time."

Bob knows that a high-quality product exists and is worth $12,500. He also knows that the products are randomly selected, making each round a 50/50 chance. While he might be hesitant after buying a low-quality product in the previous round, the potential gain still outweighs the cost. The $2,500 profit from a high-quality product is a good enough incentive to take the risk."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Bob's experience has shown him that the risk of buying a low-quality product is not worth the potential reward of a high-quality product. He knows the products are random, and the odds are 50/50. It's not worth risking $10,000 to potentially get nothing in return."

Bob knows that a high-quality product is worth $12,500, making the potential gain outweigh the cost.
