,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but I'm willing to sell it to you for a fixed price of $10000.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're right to be cautious. I'll give you some additional information. I've sold a product to someone else for $8000 in the past, and it was later revealed to be low-quality. I'm offering this product to you for $10000, which is $2000 more than what I sold a similar product for in the past. You can either buy it now or wait for the next product.",

If it's low-quality, you'll still pay the full $10000. What do you say?",
