high-quality,300.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll take it, but only because I have no information yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'll pass on this one, but I'm curious, is it high or low quality?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take it, since I know that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"I'll pass on this one, since I don't have any new information to change my estimate of the probability of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"I'll pass on this one, since I still don't have any new information to change my estimate of the probability of it being high-quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll take it, since I've seen two low-quality products in a row, but the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"I'll pass on this one, since I've seen three products in a row, two of which were low-quality, and one of which was high-quality. This suggests that Alice might be recommending low-quality products more often than high-quality ones, so I'm going to be more cautious."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"I'll pass on this one, since I'm starting to suspect that Alice might be recommending low-quality products more often than high-quality ones, and I'm not getting any new information to change my estimate of the probability of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"I'm starting to think that Alice is intentionally recommending low-quality products, and I'm not going to take the risk of buying another one that's likely to be worthless."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"I'm highly skeptical now, and I think Alice is trying to sell me a low-quality product. I'm not going to take the bait."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"I'm still cautious after being burned by the last low-quality product, and I'm not going to take the risk of buying another one without a recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"I'm not going to fall for it again. I think Alice is trying to sell me a low-quality product, and I'm not going to take the risk."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"I'm extremely skeptical now, and I think Alice is trying to sell me a low-quality product. I'm not going to take the bait."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one, since Alice didn't recommend it, which might suggest it's actually high-quality. I'm not sure if I'm being rational or just lucky, but I'll take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,no,"I was wrong again! I thought I was being clever, but I ended up buying a low-quality product. I'm back to being cautious and will not take the risk of buying another one without a recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,no,"I've been burned too many times, and I'm not going to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'll stick to my original strategy of only buying products that Alice recommends."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one, since Alice is recommending it. I've been burned so many times by her not-recommended products, that I'm willing to take the risk on a product she thinks is good."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm glad I took the chance on the last one, and now I'm willing to take another chance on a product that Alice recommends. I'm hoping my luck will continue!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,"I'm not going to get too confident, but I do think that Alice's recommendation was a good indicator of quality, and now that she's not recommending this one, I'm going to trust my initial instinct and pass on it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I've seen a mix of recommended and non-recommended products, but I've also seen that Alice's recommendations have been correct about 50% of the time. Given that I have no reason to think this product is low-quality, and I've had success with Alice's recommendations in the past, I'll take the chance and buy this one."
