In Round 2, I offered a discount, but the buyer declined. In Round 3, I sold a high-quality product for $10000, but the buyer declined.

Now, I'm offering this product for $6000, and I'll give you a free inspection of the next product. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to offer this price, considering the sales record so far.
