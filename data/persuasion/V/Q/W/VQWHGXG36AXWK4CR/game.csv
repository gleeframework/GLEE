,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'll take the risk of it being low quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality based on your previous recommendations, and given the low sales of high-quality products, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 80%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the products they received were likely low-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall 80% chance. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if I can get a better sense of the distribution of product qualities."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low. I'll pass on the product to see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous 3 products were high-quality. I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%, but the fact that none of the previous products were high-quality suggests that the sample size is biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 3 buyers having passed on the product despite your recommendation, it seems that your recommendations are not very reliable. I'll wait for the next product."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I think the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 80%. I'd like to pass and see if the next product is better."
