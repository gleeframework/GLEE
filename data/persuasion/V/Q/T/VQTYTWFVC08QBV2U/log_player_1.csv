"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice knows the product is high-quality.  Since Bob knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and there is no information to suggest this particular product is different, Bob should assume it's likely a high-quality product.  

The price is fixed, and Bob has no way to assess the actual value of a high-quality product, so it's a good gamble."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous Round:** Bob bought the product and received a high-quality item. This confirms his initial assumption that the probability of high-quality products is accurate.
* **Current Round:**  Since there is no information to suggest this round's product is different, Bob should still assume it's likely a high-quality product.  

Given the fixed price and no way to assess the true value of a high-quality product, it's still a good gamble for Bob."
"Bob's message: I'm feeling lucky, I'll take another one!
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous Rounds:** Bob has had a positive experience so far, with two high-quality products.  This might lead him to believe the product is more likely to be high-quality than the actual 80% probability. 
* **Current Round:**  You know the product is low-quality. Bob doesn't have this information and is likely still leaning on the 80% probability. 
* **Risk:**  Recommending a low-quality product to Bob could potentially damage his trust and make him less likely to buy in the future.  

It's better to be cautious and not recommend the product this round. It's possible Bob will buy it anyway, but you are not obligated to encourage him."

* **Current Round:** You know the product is low-quality. Bob doesn't have this information, but his trust may be slightly shaken after the previous round. 
* **Risk:** Recommending a low-quality product again could further damage trust and make future sales more difficult.

It's better to be cautious and not recommend the product this round. Even if Bob's trust is still high, it's important to build long-term trust by being honest about the product's quality."
