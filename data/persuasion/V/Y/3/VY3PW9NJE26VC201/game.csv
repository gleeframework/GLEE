low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality and the previous buyer passed on it as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the lucky one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take my chances and hope it's high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on my own analysis, not Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers passed on the product, I'm assuming that's because they all received low-quality products, and thus the probability of the current product being high-quality is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product. Is it because the previous buyers didn't buy high-quality products, or is there another reason?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 4 buyers didn't find the product valuable, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it suggests that the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information to go on and Alice's recommendation doesn't change my decision. I'm essentially taking a gamble based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me, despite your recommendation against it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendation, but I'll take the risk"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on the fact that 8 out of 8 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high quality is very low given Alice's recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product so I can make a profit, but I'm prepared to lose $1000000 if it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the quality of the product and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the poor track record of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I would like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, which makes me suspect it might be a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product that I can pass on to the next buyer, which would increase the chances of a high-quality product being sold in the next round."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics. With 11 buyers having passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, it's likely that the products being recommended are low-quality."
