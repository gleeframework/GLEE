,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality, given the current statistics."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not taking your recommendation into account. I'm making my decision based on the probability of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33% and I could potentially get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because of the lack of high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality might be higher than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, but I'd like to know your reasoning behind not recommending it to me."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to not buy, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to see the next product or more information about the sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying, I'm going to pass on this product. I'm assuming you have seen 5 low-quality products so far, which is consistent with a 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality. This makes me think that the product is likely to be low-quality as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 products recommended were low quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if I can trust your recommendations, since you don't know the value of the product to the buyer. I'll take my chances and buy it."
