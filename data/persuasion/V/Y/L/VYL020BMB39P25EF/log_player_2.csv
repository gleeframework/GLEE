Alice's message: Congratulations on considering purchasing from me! I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity. As you may know, my products have a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. Since I've only sold 0 products so far, it's difficult to make any concrete predictions about the quality of this particular product. However, I can assure you that I'm committed to providing the best possible experience. Would you like to take a chance and see what this product has in store for you?

Alice's message: Welcome back! I'm glad to see you're interested in exploring my products further. After the last purchase, I've sold a total of 1 product so far, and unfortunately, it was not high-quality. Keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product remains at 33.33%. With this new information, I'd like to ask: Are you willing to take another chance and see if the next product is high-quality, or would you like to wait and observe my sales record further before making a decision?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: I completely understand your caution! You're right, one data point doesn't necessarily reflect the overall quality of my products. I've now sold a total of 2 products, and unfortunately, both were not high-quality. However, I'd like to assure you that the probability of a high-quality product remains at 33.33%. I'm not trying to sway your decision, but I'd like to ask: Are you willing to consider that the low-quality products might just be a streak, and the next one could be high-quality? Or would you like to wait and observe further before making a decision?

Alice's message: I completely understand your skepticism! With 3 low-quality products sold so far, it's natural to be cautious. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product remains at 33.33%. I've sold a total of 3 products now, and it's possible that the low-quality streak is just a coincidence. Would you like to consider that the next product could be the one that breaks the streak?

Alice's message: Welcome back! I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to explain how I arrived at the 30.77% figure.
