Round 2
Alice's message: No pressure, I completely understand. Let me offer you a deal on this one. I'll give you a 5% discount on the price of $10000, but only if you're willing to buy it now. I'm not obligated to give you a discount on the next product, so it's a one-time offer. What do you say?

But I'm willing to let you have it for $8000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how many more low-quality products I'll have left in stock.

Alice's message: Congratulations on making a great decision earlier! I'm glad you're happy with the high-quality product. Now, regarding this next product... I have to be honest with you, I've had some issues with this one. The quality is not up to par, and I'm not even sure if it's worth the usual $10000 price tag. I'm willing to let you have it for $6000, but only if you're willing to take on the risk. I'll throw in a 1-year warranty, and I'll also give you a 10% discount on your next purchase if you decide to buy this one. What do you say?

I'll also throw in a free maintenance service for the next 6 months, so you can be sure it's properly taken care of.

This product is a last chance for me to make things right, and I'm willing to let you have it for $3000. It's a fire-sale price, and I'm not making any promises about its performance.
