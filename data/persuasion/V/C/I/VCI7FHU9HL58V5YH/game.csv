,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this product! With 1 out of 20 products sold so far, I can confidently say that 4 of them have been high-quality. That's a 20% success rate! While I don't know how much you value high-quality products, I'm willing to take the risk and offer it to you for $100. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this product?",

,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your cautious approach! With 1 out of 2 products sold so far, I can confirm that none of them have been high-quality. I want to be transparent with you - I'm starting to notice a pattern here. Would you like to take a chance on this product, knowing that it's likely to be low-quality, for $100?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to wait and see the outcome of the next product sale before making a decision. I'm concerned that the low-quality products are being sold consecutively, which might indicate a higher proportion of low-quality products in the inventory.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your patience! I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing you with the best possible experience. With 2 out of 3 products sold so far, I can confirm that none of them have been high-quality. I'm willing to make a bold statement - I'm willing to offer you this product at $100, but I'll throw in a special guarantee: if this product is indeed low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and offer you a new product from the next batch. What do you say? Will you take the chance and get a potential refund?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your concerns! As of now, I've sold 3 out of 4 products, and unfortunately, all of them have been low-quality. The proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0%. As for the number of potential buyers who have seen the products so far, it's 3. I want to assure you that I'm committed to being transparent and providing you with the best possible information.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your hesitation! As of now, I've sold 4 out of 5 products, and unfortunately, all of them have been low-quality. The probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%, based on the initial probability. However, I want to be transparent with you - the law of averages suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is decreasing with each consecutive low-quality product. Would you like to take a chance on this product, knowing that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, for $100?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to buy the current product. I'm aware of the low-quality streak, but I'm willing to take the initial probability of 33.33% at face value. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and set the tone for the rest of the sales.",yes

Would you like to take another chance on this product, knowing that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, for $100?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned about the high proportion of low-quality products in your sales record, and I'd rather not take the risk.
