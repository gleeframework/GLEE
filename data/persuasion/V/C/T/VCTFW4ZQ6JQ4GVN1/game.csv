low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, as there's no information to go by yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Based on the low probability of the product being high quality and the fact that the first buyer also did not buy, I'm inclined to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I'm trying to gather more information about the product's quality based on Alice's recommendation. I'm not optimistic about the product's quality based on your previous recommendation."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation and the fact that none of the previous two buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to the next buyer, considering the current sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I think it's likely to be low quality based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality given that she has an incentive to recommend the product to the buyer regardless of its quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous buyers' experiences. How many products were offered to them, and how many of those were high-quality?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is against it, which makes me suspect it might be high quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 3 previous buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more information or a different recommendation before making a purchase."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, and Alice's recommendation is to buy, I'm skeptical that the product is high quality. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, given that none have been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there a pattern or a specific reason why you don't think this product is worth buying?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide me with a clear explanation for your recommendation not to buy. I want to understand the reasoning behind it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Since 4 out of 4 buyers have passed on the product, it suggests that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on the product and let you know my reasoning."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than the overall 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 33.33% due to the lack of sales so far."
