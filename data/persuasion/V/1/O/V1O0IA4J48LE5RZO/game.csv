high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'm not convinced yet, I'd like to wait and see the outcome of my decision to inform my future decisions."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the assumption that the probability of it being high-quality is 50% since no products have been sold yet and I don't have any information to update this probability."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the products are low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the fact that the first buyer didn't buy it and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This makes me suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait and observe more sales before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyer didn't buy it and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can get a good deal on a high-quality product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the probability of it being high-quality, not Alice's recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50.00%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low probability of a high-quality product being sold in the past might increase the chances of this product being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, and 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't find the product worth buying, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for a higher proportion of high-quality products to be sold before considering purchasing."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous 5 buyers have not been successful, and I'd like to see a more representative sample of the products before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations, it seems like she has a good idea of the product's quality. Since she doesn't recommend buying, I'll pass on this one. I'm curious to see the outcome, but I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations. The fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers didn't buy the product suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is very low.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's lack of recommendation makes me think it's likely to be low quality, and I'm willing to take the risk to get it for $10000. If it were a high-quality product, I'd be willing to pay more, but since she's not recommending it, I'm going to take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have already been offered the product and none of them purchased a high-quality one, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, I think the proportion of high-quality products is likely to be lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
