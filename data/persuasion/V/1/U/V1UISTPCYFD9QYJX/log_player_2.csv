Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you liked the previous product, but I have to warn you that this one is different. I've been told that the previous product was a'steal', and this one is actually worth a lot more than $1000000. In fact, I'm not even sure I'm making a profit on this sale. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure I believe you. I'll pass on this one.""}"

Round 4
Alice's message: I think I see a pattern here. You're a savvy buyer, and you're not buying what I'm selling. That's okay! I'll make it easy for you. I'll throw in a'money-back guarantee'. If you don't like the product, I'll give you a full refund. But if you do decide to buy it, I'll also throw in a 'bonus' product of equal value. Would you like to take a chance and see what you get?

(dramatic pause)...a slightly used tissue! Yeah, it's not the most exciting thing, but hey, it's a bonus, right? And I'm still willing to sell you this product for $1000000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. What do you say, want to take it home?

Round 6
Alice's message: Okay, okay, I get it. You're not impressed by the tissue. But let me ask you, have you ever considered the sentimental value of a used tissue? It's a tangible reminder of the fleeting nature of life, and the impermanence of human emotions. It's a collector's item, really. And I'll throw in a special 'Certificate of Authenticity' that says it's been used by a real person. Would you like to take it home and display it proudly?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I think I'll pass on the used tissue and the certificate of authenticity.
