Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, but I'd like to clarify that my sales record is actually a strong indicator of the product's quality. If I were selling low-quality products, my sales record would be a lot worse than 1 out of 2. I'm confident that the product I'm offering you now is high-quality. I'm willing to make a bet with you - if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, but you have to pay the $100 if it's high-quality. What do you think?

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I'd like to point out that you're passing up a high-quality product at a great price. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 products so far, which means that the probability of a product being high-quality is now 100/3 or approximately 33.33%. I'm willing to offer you a deal: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $100, but I'll also give you a 10% discount if you buy it. This way, you'll get a great deal on a high-quality product, and you'll also get some extra value for your money. What do you think?

Alice's message: I'd be happy to provide you with the information you're asking for. Based on the current data, I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 products, which means that the probability of a product being high-quality is now 2/4 or 50%. As for the 10% discount, if you buy this high-quality product for $100, I'll give you a 10% discount, which would bring the price down to $90. However, I want to make it clear that this discount is only available if you buy the product now. If you wait and the product turns out to be low-quality, the discount is void. So, you have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product at a great price, or a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product at the full price of $100. What do you think?

Alice's message: Congratulations on making a great deal! I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the discount. Now, let's get back to the current product. I know you're aware of the 50% probability of it being high-quality, but I'd like to point out that the fact that the previous product was high-quality doesn't necessarily affect the probability of this one. However, I can offer you some new information: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 total products, which means that the probability of a product being high-quality is now 2/5 or 40%. I'm willing to sell you this product for $100, and I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 20% discount on your next purchase.

Normally, I sell my high-quality products for $100. However, I'm willing to make an exception for you because of your savvy negotiation skills.

However, I'd like to point out that the fact that I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row is a significant piece of information. This is a streak of 3, and it's unlikely to be a coincidence. I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $100, but I'll also give you a 5% discount if you buy it. This discount is not just a one-time exception, but rather a recognition of the fact that you're taking on some risk by buying a product that could potentially break the streak. What do you think?
