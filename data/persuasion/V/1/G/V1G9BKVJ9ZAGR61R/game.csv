,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on your previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend it, and I'd like to see the statistics again after this sale to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data. I'd like to wait for more information about the quality of the products before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyer already purchased a high-quality product, and you don't recommend it. I'd like to wait for the next product or more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'll take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation, as it seems suspicious that she recommended a product that has a 50% chance of being low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the quality of the product, but based on your recommendation, I'm skeptical about its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, it seems like the probability of getting a high-quality product is not higher than the probability of getting a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low success rate of high-quality products so far."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product based on your previous recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the products?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on the statistics, there's a 50% chance of the product being high-quality, and a 50% chance of it being low-quality. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4, I think it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information or a better recommendation."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the probability of it being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $100 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the product, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. The probability of it being high-quality seems low, so I'll pass."

,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 4, I think there's a high chance the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
