high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality, so I'm going to take a chance and pass."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product, and considering the low probability of a high-quality product being sold (33.33%), I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers also passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively high."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, which suggests a low-quality product is more likely to be sold. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 4 buyers having purchased and no high-quality products sold, I suspect that the products being sold are likely low-quality. I'll wait for a higher-quality product to be offered."
