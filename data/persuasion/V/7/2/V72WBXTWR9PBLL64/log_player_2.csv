"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the quality of each product, her recommendation is valuable information. Even though the product has a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality, there's a higher chance that Alice is recommending a high-quality product. Buying the product gives you a chance at a $200 profit, while passing guarantees you'll get nothing. It's a gamble, but a calculated one based on Alice's recommendation."
