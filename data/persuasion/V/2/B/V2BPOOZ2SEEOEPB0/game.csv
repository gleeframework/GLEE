,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"The probability of the product being high-quality is 50%, but based on your sales record, only 1 out of 3 products sold were high-quality. Given the $10000 price and the potential $20000 value of a high-quality product, but $0 for a low-quality one, I don't see a strong incentive to buy without more favorable odds or a lower price."
