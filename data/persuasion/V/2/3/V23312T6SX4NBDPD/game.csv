high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 1 product recommended was low quality, which suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that Alice recommended it might be a red flag, and I'd rather not take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'm not convinced by your recommendation based on the current statistics. It seems like the previous two buyers were also convinced by your recommendations, but neither product was high-quality. I'd like to see a better track record before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I would like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation and the fact that none of the previous products sold were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than usual, and I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm skeptical about the recommendation. Can you explain why you're advising me not to buy it?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it seems that Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'd rather wait for a recommendation that is not based on Alice's previous sales record."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products, given that all previous buyers have passed on the products after her recommendations. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to risk losing $1000000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also received the same recommendation and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high quality is lower than the overall probability of 80.00%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 3 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, considering that the previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, it's likely that they were all low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to know the quality of the previous products before making a decision.
