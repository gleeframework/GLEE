,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, I don't have any information to go on yet, so it's a 50/50 shot."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the previous buyer must have gotten a low-quality product, which means the probability of a high-quality product is higher now."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. The fact that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were low quality suggests that the probability of a product being high quality might be lower than 50%. I'd like to know the number of total products sold before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm taking a chance because I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far might be a coincidence, and I'm willing to take a shot at getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak!"

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers bought the product despite no high-quality products being sold, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. I'm going to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure I trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't think this product is worth buying?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, I suspect that your recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product or gather more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
