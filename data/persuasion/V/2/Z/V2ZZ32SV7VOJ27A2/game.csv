high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing this based on the fact that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're recommending against it. Is there any information that I'm missing?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the fact that you don't recommend it might actually make it more likely to be low-quality, so I'll take the chance."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product and see the outcome. I'd like to know whether the product is high-quality or low-quality before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'd like to see the recommendation for the next product after this one is discarded. I'm curious to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes after this one is discarded."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm going to buy it, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than 33.33% due to the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: with 1 high-quality product sold out of 5, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 1/5, which is 20%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 6 buyers purchased a product, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is low. Given Alice's recommendation against buying, I will pass on this product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation based on the low success rate of high-quality products so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high quality, but I'm willing to take the risk and potentially benefit from the 1/3 chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the probability of it being high-quality is lower than the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, which is 1/8 = 0.125. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'd like to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 1/8, which is lower than the true probability of a product being high-quality (1/3). If the true probability were 1/8, I would expect to see more high-quality products sold by now. Therefore, I suspect that Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample, and I'm going to pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious, can you tell me what the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and what the statistics are for the previous 8 buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll buy the product, but I'm not expecting much."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, as I'm surprised you're not recommending it to me. Is it because the previous buyers' feedback or the overall sales record?"
