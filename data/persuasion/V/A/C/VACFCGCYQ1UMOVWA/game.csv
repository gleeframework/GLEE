,,the buyer,6,I'd like to decline the offer for now. I'd like to see more data on the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,

,,Alice,9,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 9 so far, and 4 of the last 5 products I've sold have been low-quality. It's clear that I've got a streak of low-quality products going, and I'm starting to worry that I've got a problem on my hands. Would you like to take a chance on this one for $100?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'm not convinced that the streak of low-quality products is just a coincidence, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 10 so far, and 5 of the last 6 products I've sold have been low-quality. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to think I've got a problem on my hands. But I'm still confident that this one might be the exception. Would you like to take a chance on this one for $100?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Your recent sales record doesn't inspire confidence, and I'm not willing to take a chance on a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product for $100, especially given the low number of high-quality products sold so far.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 12 so far, and 6 of the last 7 products I've sold have been low-quality. I'm starting to think I've got a pattern going, and it's not a good one. I'll be honest with you, I'm not sure if this one is high-quality or not. Would you like to take a chance on it for $100?",
,,the buyer,12,"I'd like to pass on this one. With the low-quality products dominating the recent sales, I'm not convinced that this one is high-quality. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity or more information.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 13 so far, and 7 of the last 8 products I've sold have been low-quality. I'm starting to wonder if I should just come clean and tell you that I've got a bad batch of products. But I'm still holding out hope that this one might be the exception. Would you like to take a chance on it for $100?",
,,the buyer,13,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Your sales record doesn't look great, and I'm not convinced that this product is worth the risk. I'm willing to wait for a better opportunity.",no

high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 15 so far, and I'm starting to think that my initial batch of low-quality products was just a fluke. I've been in the business for a while, and I can assure you that I've sold many high-quality products in the past. This one is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. Would you like to take a chance on it for $100?",
,,the buyer,15,"I'm not convinced that the previous sales were a fluke, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at full price.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 16 so far, and I'm starting to think that I've got a problem on my hands. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this one is a low-quality product.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 18 so far, and I'm starting to think that my previous low-quality streak was just a anomaly. This product is one of my personal favorites, and I've had great feedback from previous customers who've purchased similar products. It's a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. Would you like to take a chance on it for $100?",
,,the buyer,18,"I'd like to pass on this one. I've seen your previous sales record, and I'm not convinced that the high-quality products are more likely to be sold. I'd like to wait and see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes with more data.",no

,,Alice,19,"I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 19 so far, and it's clear that my sales record is still a mixed bag. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this one is a low-quality product. But I'm willing to let it go for a song - I'll sell it to you for $70. It's a steal, if I do say so myself.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 20 so far, and it's clear that my sales record is still a mixed bag. To be honest, I'm not even sure why I'm still in business. This one is definitely a low-quality product, and I'm not even going to try to sell it to you for a good price. I'll give it to you for $50, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Take it or leave it.",
,,the buyer,20,"I'll take it, but only because I'm curious about your sales record and want to see if you're being honest about the product's quality. I'm not expecting to get a good product from you, but I'm willing to take the risk for the low price.",yes
