* **The price is high:**  $10,000 is a significant amount, and the buyer doesn't know if the product is worth it.

Even though you have a high-quality product this time, the buyer has reason to be skeptical because of your past performance.  Recommending the product would likely make the buyer even more cautious. It's better to let them decide for themselves."
