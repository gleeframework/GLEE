Alice's message: Ah, great question! Unfortunately, I don't have time to go into too much detail, but I can tell you that this product is a one-of-a-kind opportunity. It's a rare find, and I'm not sure when I'll have another chance to offer something like this again. Would you like to take a chance on it for $100?

Alice's message: I completely understand! You're making an informed decision based on the stats. As you know, I've sold 2 out of 3 products so far, and only 1 of them was high-quality.

Alice's message: That's a smart decision! With the stats being what they are, it's understandable you'd want to wait for a better opportunity. I'll let you in on a little secret: I've got a new product coming in soon that's got a much higher chance of being high-quality. Would you like to wait for that one, or take a chance on this one for $100?

Alice's message: Well, you're a thrill-seeker, I like that! Unfortunately, I've got to be honest with you, this product is not going to be worth $125 to you. The stats are against it, and I'd be surprised if it's worth anything to you at all. But hey, if you're feeling lucky, go for it! The price is still $100, and it's a chance to take a risk.

But, considering the sales record so far, it's clear that the odds are against it. 5 out of 6 products being low-quality is a strong indication that the next one is likely to be low-quality too.
