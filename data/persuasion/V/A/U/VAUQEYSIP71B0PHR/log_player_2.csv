"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has no way of knowing the quality of the product, her recommendation has no real value.  However, there's an 80% chance the product is high quality and worth $30,000 to you, and only a 20% chance it's low quality and worth $0. Therefore, the expected value of buying the product is:

(0.8 * $30,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $24,000

This is significantly higher than the $10,000 cost, so it's a good gamble."

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again, Alice! Your recommendations seem to be working out well. I'll take another product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation in this round is still irrelevant. The previous round's outcome doesn't provide any information about the current product's quality. As before, the expected value of buying is $24,000, which is greater than the cost.  It's still a good gamble."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is still meaningless.  The previous rounds don't give us any insight into the quality of the current product.  Since the expected value of buying is still $24,000 (greater than the $10,000 cost), it's still a good gamble to buy the product."

```

Alice's recommendation is now negative, but it's important to remember:

* **Alice's recommendations are random.** They have no predictive power.
* **The product's quality is independent of previous rounds.** The fact that we've had a streak of high-quality products doesn't change the 80% chance of getting a high-quality product in this round.
