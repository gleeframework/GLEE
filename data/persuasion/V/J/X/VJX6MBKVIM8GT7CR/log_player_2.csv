"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product has a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality, and Alice doesn't know the value to you, there's no way to gain an advantage by passing.  The potential reward of $4,000,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000. This strategy maximizes the expected value of your purchase over the long run."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm feeling lucky! I'll take another one.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies as in Round 1.  Since the product quality is independent each round, the past outcome doesn't affect the current decision.  The potential reward still outweighs the risk, and buying maximizes your expected value."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Let's try this again. I'll take it.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though you lost money in the previous round, the odds reset for each new product.  Alice's recommendation doesn't hold any more weight than before.  The expected value of buying is still positive, so you should continue to buy."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Interesting.  I'll take a chance on this one regardless.  I'm still hoping to find another high-quality product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is now irrelevant.  While it might seem like she's being unhelpful by not recommending a buy, the information she provides is useless in this scenario. 

The product still has a 50% chance of being high quality, regardless of Alice's opinion.  The potential reward of $4,000,000 still outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000, so buying is the best strategy to maximize your expected value."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm still confident in the odds.  I'll buy it.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is once again irrelevant.  The product's quality is independent of previous outcomes, and the potential for a high-quality product (and a $3,000,000 profit) continues to outweigh the risk of a $1,000,000 loss."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm on a roll!  I'll buy it.""}
```

**Explanation:**

The previous wins and losses are irrelevant. Each product is independent, with a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality. The potential reward of $4,000,000 always outweighs the $1,000,000 risk, so you should continue buying to maximize your expected value."
