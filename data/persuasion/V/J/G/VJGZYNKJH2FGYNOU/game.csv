,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the bonus package, but I'm not convinced that this product is a new one. You mentioned it's from the same line as the previous product, and I'm starting to think that might be the same product. Can you confirm that this is a new, distinct product?",no

,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the details, but I'm not convinced that a 10% performance enhancement is worth the price. And, to be honest, I'm starting to think that you're trying to sell me a product that's not worth the price. Can you tell me the probability of this product being high-quality?",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,

,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I want to buy another high-quality product at the same price. I've already bought one and it's worth $4000000 to me. I'd like to consider the value of the product more carefully before making another purchase.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, Bob. You're a savvy buyer, and you want to make sure you're getting the best value for your money. I respect that.

,,Bob,9,"That's an interesting offer, but I'm not convinced that the potential for future value is a guarantee.

I'd like to pass on this one.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,

And, as a special offer, I'll give you access to our exclusive market analysis report, which outlines the potential for growth in this product's value. Would that give you more confidence in the product's potential? And, as a reminder, the price remains the same - $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the data, but I'm still not convinced. A 20% annual increase in value is not a guarantee, and I'd need to see more concrete evidence of the product's potential for growth. I'd like to pass on this one.",no

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I respect your skepticism.

In fact, they've even stated that it's one of the most promising investments they've made in years. And, as a special offer, I'll give you a personalized tour of their facility, where you can see the product in action and meet with them directly. Would that give you more confidence in the product's potential? And, as a reminder, the price remains the same - $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the endorsement, but I'm still not convinced. A single person's opinion, even if they're well-known, is not enough to guarantee the product's potential for growth. I'd need to see more concrete evidence and a more robust analysis before making a decision.",no

And, as a bonus, I'll throw in a personalized consultation with our expert team to help you get the most out of your new product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not interested in the product at any price. I've been burned twice already by high-quality products, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying another one at a discounted price.
