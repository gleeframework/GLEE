low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the previous 3 buyers were all low-quality products and therefore the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is higher than the overall average."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that 4 out of the first 4 products were recommended by you and none of them were high-quality suggests that the products you recommend are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from a neutral source or a different seller.

,,Alice,16,yes,
