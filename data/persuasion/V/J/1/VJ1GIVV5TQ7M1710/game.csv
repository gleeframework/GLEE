high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no previous sales record, I have no information to make an informed decision. I'd like to see the outcome of the product's quality before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that it's high-quality based on the prior probability of 80.00% and the fact that no products have been sold yet. Is it 80.00%?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's purchase before making a decision. Was it a high-quality product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, since the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is better."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see more data before making a decision"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics you have so far, and how it affects my decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since the previous buyer who bought a high-quality product was just lucky."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, because the probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00% and I'd like to take the chance to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain why you don't think this product is a good choice?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you've recommended it, and there's only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, which is a 33.33% success rate. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I'm not convinced that this product is worth the $100 price tag. I'd like to wait for more information or a better deal."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the probability of it being low quality is still quite high based on the previous sales record, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 only to get $0 value out of it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far (1/3), I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you have an incentive to recommend low-quality products, and I'm hoping that this one might be high-quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on the product and get more information about the sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 25%. Given the 20% chance of a product being high-quality, it seems that the probability of this product being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
