high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a product with a 50% chance of being low quality, especially since the previous buyer didn't find it valuable."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products offered and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm going to take the risk, I'll buy it, I'm the second buyer, and I'm hoping for a high-quality product"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation. Given that 2 previous buyers purchased the products despite her recommendations, I'm starting to suspect that the products Alice recommends are more likely to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk. The fact that you're not recommending it makes me think it might be a low-quality product, but I'm willing to take a chance since I've only seen 2 sales so far, and none of them were high-quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discount."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers bought the products after Alice's recommendations, which suggests that all 4 products were low-quality. I'm going to take a chance and pass."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics, and since no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to take a chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend this product? Is it just based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far, or is there something else I should know?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 products were low quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality as well. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that you've recommended not to buy the product, I'm going to assume it's low quality. With 6 buyers having passed on the products and no high-quality products sold, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this one too. I'd like to know the quality of the product after my decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers purchased the products recommended by you, which suggests that all 6 products were low quality. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality based on your previous recommendations. Since 6 out of 6 buyers have bought the product and none of them have reported a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that all products offered so far have been low quality. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 6 failed attempts and no high-quality products sold, I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. I'd like to pass and see if you can provide more information or change your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on any information that would be relevant to my personal valuation of the product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
