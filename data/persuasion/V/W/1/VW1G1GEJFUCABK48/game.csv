low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I completely understand your preference for high-quality products, and I respect your decision to pass on this one. However, I want to ask you a question: if you knew that this low-quality product was worth $0 to you, would you pay $5000 for it? I'm not asking you to take a risk on its quality, but rather to consider the opportunity cost of not buying it. If you're willing to walk away from this deal, I'll move on to the next product.",

This is a significant discount, and I'm essentially giving it away. If you're still not interested, I'll stop offering you products and move on to the next potential buyer.",
,,Bob,8,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I appreciate your understanding of my principles. I believe it's best for both of us to part ways on this note, as our values and expectations regarding product quality and pricing seem to diverge.",no
