Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the hint, but I'll pass on this one. The probability of it being high quality is still 33.33%, and I'm not willing to take another $10,000 risk for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless to me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""A 50% discount doesn't change the fact that there's a 66.67% chance the product is low-quality. I'd still be taking a significant risk of losing $5000, and I'm not willing to take it.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the guarantee and the upgrade, but I know you're aware of the true value of this product to me. Since you know it's worth $0 to me if it's low-quality, I'm not willing to pay $10,000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism. Let me ask you this: if I were to tell you that this product is actually a one-of-a-kind item that I've been holding onto for a long time, and it's not part of the same batch as the previous ones, would that change your decision?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to consider this product as a separate entity from the previous ones, and the new information makes me slightly more inclined to take the risk.
