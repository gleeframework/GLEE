**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  We have only 2 previous sales to base our decision on, which isn't enough to draw strong conclusions about Alice's recommendations.
* **Alice's Incentives:** Alice has a strong incentive to sell as many products as possible, regardless of quality. This makes her recommendation less trustworthy.
* **High Potential Reward:**  A high-quality product is worth $4,000,000, which is a significant reward despite the risk of a low-quality product being worthless.

**Given the limited information and the potentially high reward, it's worth taking a chance and buying the product.**"
