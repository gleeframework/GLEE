low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, I don't have any information to go on, but I'm willing to take a chance"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product remaining in the inventory?
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that the first buyer also passed on the product and that no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall 33.33% chance. I'd like to wait for a more favorable situation.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'd like to know what the probability of the product being high quality is based on the data so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to reveal the true quality of the product after my decision. I want to know if it's high or low quality, regardless of whether I buy it or not."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you tell me the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm skeptical given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, Alice. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product I'll get might be low-quality. I'll wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record. If it's less than 50%, I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend it, Alice. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. Your lack of recommendation makes me think the product might be low quality, so I'm willing to take the risk. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were discouraged by Alice's recommendations, I suspect that the previous products were all low-quality. This means the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability of 33.33%. I will pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products sold were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, this is not surprising. However, the fact that Alice does not recommend me to buy the product suggests that she believes the product is likely to be low-quality. Therefore, I will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations. If 4 buyers have already passed on the product, I'm likely to be in a similar situation. I'll pass and see if the next buyer is more optimistic or if the product is indeed low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, I'm skeptical about the product's quality."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 attempts, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality and not worth the $100. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high quality, but since Alice doesn't recommend it, I'll pass on it. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the previous 4 buyers."
