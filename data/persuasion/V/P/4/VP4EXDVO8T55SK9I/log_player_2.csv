Alice's message: This is the first product I'm offering. It's a unique opportunity to get a deal on a product that's worth potentially a lot of money. I'm not allowed to give you any information about its quality, but I can tell you that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%. If you're interested, I can offer it to you for $1000000.

Alice's message: I've had 2 products so far, and neither of them were high-quality. I know what you're thinking, but don't assume that the next product will be the same. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. It's a chance to get a potentially valuable product at a discounted price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since the probability of a high-quality product remains at 33.33% and I have no information about the current product, I will pass. The expected value of buying is ($4,000,000 * 0.3333) - $1,000,000 = $333,200. However, given the lack of sales data and only two previous low-quality products, I'll wait for more information before making a purchase.""}"

I know that's not as high as the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product, but it's a start. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000.
