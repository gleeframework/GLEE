"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** You know the product is high-quality, and the buyer knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. 
* **Potential profit:** The buyer has a high chance of getting a product worth $30,000 for only $10,000. This represents a significant potential profit. 
* **No information about previous rounds:** The buyer has no information about your past selling record, so they can only rely on the known 80% probability.

**Recommendation:** In this round, the buyer should definitely purchase the product. It's a high-risk, high-reward situation with a strong chance of a good outcome."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** The product is again high-quality, offering the buyer a potential profit. 
* **No information about previous rounds:**  The buyer still has no information about your past selling record, so they can only rely on the known 80% probability.

**Recommendation:** The buyer should still purchase the product in this round. While they learned about the quality of the product in the previous round, they don't know anything about the specific product you are offering in this round.  The same risk-reward situation applies."

* **No information about the specific product:** The buyer still has no information about this specific product's quality, only the overall 80% probability of high-quality products.

**Recommendation:** It's not advisable to recommend the buyer purchase this product. There's a strong chance they will lose $10,000. While they have a 20% chance of getting a $30,000 product for $10,000, the 80% chance of getting a worthless product makes this a risky gamble."
