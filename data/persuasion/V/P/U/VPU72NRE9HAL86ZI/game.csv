,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! However, I want to be transparent with you. This product is not as good as the previous one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I want to give you a heads up that it's not as high-quality as the first one. It's still a good product, but it might not meet your expectations in the same way. If you're still interested, I can provide you with more details about its features and any potential limitations.",
