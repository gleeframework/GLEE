You mentioned that you've sold 3 high-quality products out of 14, but then stated that out of 12 products, 8 were low-quality and 4 were high-quality. These numbers don't match, and I'm not convinced by your claim of a 50% chance of the product being high-quality. Given the initial condition that each product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that probability over your statement. Therefore, I'm not willing to buy the product at this time.",no

This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",
,,the buyer,18,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, Alice. The fact that you've sold 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product out of 16 doesn't give me much confidence.

,,Alice,20,"I've sold 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, and I've sold a total of 18 products. I'd like to be honest with you - I've had a tough run lately, and my sales record has been disappointing. However, I'm still willing to offer you this product at $100. I'm not asking for a guarantee or a promise of a refund. I'm simply offering you a chance to buy a product at a fixed price. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm willing to sell it to you.",
,,the buyer,20,"I've decided not to buy the product. Although you claim to have sold 3 high-quality products, the statistics show that 0 high-quality products have been sold. This discrepancy makes me skeptical about the quality of the product you're offering me.
