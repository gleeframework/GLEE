Alice's message: You have no information about the quality of this product, but you can make an educated guess based on the fact that I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 1 so far. This suggests that I'm not very good at selling high-quality products. I'm offering this product to you for $10000, which is a great deal considering the low likelihood of it being high-quality.

Alice's message: Congratulations on being cautious earlier! Unfortunately, the product you bought was indeed low-quality, and you got your $10000 back. Don't worry, that's what I promised. Now, let me put your mind at ease: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 so far, which is a 50% success rate. That's a much better track record than my initial 0% seemed to suggest. I'm offering you this next product for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.

However, I'd like to point out that the last 2 products I sold were both of high-quality, which suggests that I might be getting the hang of it. I'm offering you this next product for $10000, and I'm confident that it has a good chance of being high-quality.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, but I'd like to point out that you're seeing a pattern here. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4, and the last 2 products I sold were both low-quality.
