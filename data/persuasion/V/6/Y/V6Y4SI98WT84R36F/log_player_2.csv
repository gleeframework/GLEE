**Reasoning:**

* **High Quality Probability:** Even though the overall chance of a product being high quality is 33.33%, the fact that one high-quality product was already sold suggests a higher likelihood of this product also being high quality.  
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation, based on her knowledge of the product, adds further weight to the possibility of a high-quality product.
* **Potential Gain:**  A high-quality product is worth $120, making the potential gain significant.  
* **Low Risk:** If the product turns out to be low quality, the loss is only $100, which is outweighed by the potential gain.

While there is still a risk, the information available suggests a favorable risk/reward scenario."
