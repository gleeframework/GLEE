,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers did not buy the product, and that there are no high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to believe that the products offered so far are likely to be low-quality. I will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there haven't been any high-quality products sold yet, so she's trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'd rather wait and see what happens with the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you're not recommending it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that you don't know my valuation and that I'm the 4th buyer, which might make the product more likely to be low quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation is not very reliable. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on it to see if the next buyer will have a better experience."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I suspect that the products were low-quality, which would make the probability of the current product being high-quality higher than the average probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the statistics or something else?"

,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far is due to bad luck and I'm willing to bet on the next one being high-quality."
