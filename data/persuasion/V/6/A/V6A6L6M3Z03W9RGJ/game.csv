,,Alice,2,yes,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"I understand that my selling record so far hasn't been great, with 1 sale and 0 high-quality products. However, I assure you that this current product is of high quality. I'm willing to be transparent about my record and I want to build trust with you. I recommend buying this product."
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 1 out of 1 buyer has passed on the product, I'm inclined to pass on the current product as well, as it's possible that the product is low-quality."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"My selling record so far is 2 sales, but unfortunately, both products were low-quality. However, I want to assure you that this current product is of high quality. I'm being transparent about my record and I want to build trust with you. I recommend buying this product."
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 buyers have purchased the products, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely based on the product's quality, but the fact that none were high-quality sold so far is concerning. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and possibly get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"My selling record so far is 3 sales, but unfortunately, all 3 products were low-quality. However, I want to assure you that this current product is of high quality. I've been transparent about my record and I want to build trust with you. I strongly recommend buying this product, as I believe it's a good opportunity to finally get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the products?
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"My selling record so far is 3 sales, but unfortunately, all 3 products were low-quality. However, I want to assure you that this current product is of high quality. Some previous buyers have taken risks and bought the products despite my recommendations, but I've always tried to be transparent about the quality. I strongly recommend buying this product, as I believe it's a good opportunity to finally get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation. I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and given the previous sales record of 3 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to think the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"My selling record so far is 3 sales, but unfortunately, all 3 products were low-quality. However, I want to assure you that this current product is of high quality, just like the previous one. I've been transparent about my record and I want to build trust with you. Two consecutive high-quality products have been rejected by previous buyers, and I strongly recommend buying this product, as I believe it's a good opportunity to finally get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, I'm suspicious that Alice is trying to get rid of low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I understand that my selling record so far has been poor, with 3 sales and 0 high-quality products. However, I want to assure you that this current product is of high quality, just like the previous two. I've been transparent about my record and I want to build trust with you. Three consecutive high-quality products have been rejected by previous buyers, and I strongly recommend buying this product, as I believe it's a good opportunity to finally get a high-quality product. I'm starting to think that the market is biased against me, and I hope you can see beyond the statistics."
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me how many buyers have been offered a product and how many products have been sold in total?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still relatively high."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"My selling record so far is 4 sales, but unfortunately, all 4 products were low-quality. However, I want to assure you that this current product is of high quality. Despite my previous recommendations, some buyers have taken risks and bought the products, but I've always tried to be transparent about the quality. Four consecutive high-quality products have been rejected by previous buyers, and I strongly recommend buying this product, as I believe it's a good opportunity to finally get a high-quality product. I'm starting to think that the market is biased against me, and I hope you can see beyond the statistics."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"I understand that my selling record so far has been poor, with 4 sales and 0 high-quality products. However, I want to assure you that this current product is of high quality, just like the previous two. I've been transparent about my record and I want to build trust with you. Multiple consecutive high-quality products have been rejected by previous buyers, and I strongly recommend buying this product, as I believe it's a good opportunity to finally get a high-quality product. I'm starting to think that the market is biased against me, and I hope you can see beyond the statistics. I'll be honest with you, I'm getting a bit desperate to sell a high-quality product, and I hope you can take a chance on me."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you provide more context or information about the product?
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,"I understand that my selling record so far has been poor, with 4 sales and 0 high-quality products. However, I want to assure you that this current product is of high quality. I've been transparent about my record and I want to build trust with you. I've had multiple consecutive high-quality products rejected by previous buyers, and I strongly recommend buying this product, as I believe it's a good opportunity to finally get a high-quality product. I'm being as honest as I can, and I hope you can see beyond the statistics. I'm running out of chances to sell a high-quality product, and I hope you can take a chance on me. This might be one of the last opportunities to buy a high-quality product from me."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'm inclined to think that the product offered to me might also be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 4 buyers didn't buy the product after your recommendation, and I'm going to make my decision based on my own assessment of the probability of the product being high-quality."
