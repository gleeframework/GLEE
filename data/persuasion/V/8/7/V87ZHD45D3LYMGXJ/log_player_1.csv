You should still not recommend the product.  Here's why:

* **Building Trust:**  You've established a pattern of not recommending products. While this might seem like a losing strategy, it's actually building trust with the buyers. They now expect you to be honest, even if it means not making a sale.
* **Future Opportunities:** If you were to start recommending products now, even the high-quality one, it might appear suspicious to buyers who are used to your honesty.  By maintaining this pattern, you're setting yourself up to potentially make more sales later when you have more information. 
* **Risk of Losing All Credibility:** If you recommend this high-quality product and it's the only time you've done so, buyers might think you're desperate to make a sale and potentially lose trust in your future recommendations.

**This strategy is all about long-term thinking and building trust with buyers. While you might miss out on a few sales in the early rounds, it could lead to more sales in the future.**"
