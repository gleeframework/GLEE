"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice knows the product is high-quality, and Bob knows that there's a 50% chance of the product being high-quality. Since a high-quality product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob and costs $1,000,000, it's a good deal for him. Even if Bob doesn't know it's high-quality, the expected value of buying is positive:

* **Expected Value = (Probability of high-quality * Value of high-quality) + (Probability of low-quality * Value of low-quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.5 * $1,200,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $600,000**

Therefore, it's a good idea for Bob to buy the product."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I will proceed with the purchase.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice knows the product is low-quality, which means it's worth $0 to Bob. Even though Bob bought the product in the previous round, he doesn't know the product quality yet. He only knows the probability of it being high-quality is 50%.

Therefore, it's not advisable for Bob to buy this product. He has a 50% chance of losing $1,000,000."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your advice, Alice. Based on your recommendation, I will pass on this product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob didn't buy the product in the previous round, Alice knows this product is high-quality. The previous round's outcome doesn't change the fact that this product offers a positive expected value for Bob. 

* **Expected Value = (Probability of high-quality * Value of high-quality) + (Probability of low-quality * Value of low-quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.5 * $1,200,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $600,000**

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice knows this product is low-quality and therefore worth $0 to Bob.  While Bob may be feeling more confident after the last purchase, the fact remains that he still only has a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. It's a gamble, and the potential loss of $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gain."
