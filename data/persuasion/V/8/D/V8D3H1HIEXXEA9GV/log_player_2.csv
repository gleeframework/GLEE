Alice's message: I've sold 2 out of 4 products, and one of them was high-quality. I've had a chance to sell three low-quality products, so the probability of this one being high-quality is now higher than 33.33%. In fact, I'd say it's at least 50%. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'll give you a 25% discount if you're willing to take it off my hands. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Although you're offering a 25% discount, the cost is still $750,000. Given that a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, I need to be fairly certain that the product is high-quality to justify the purchase. While the probability of the product being high-quality may be higher than 33.33%, I'm not convinced that it's at least 50% as you claim. Your past sales record doesn't provide enough evidence to support this assertion, especially since no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm not willing to take the risk.""}"

Alice's message: I've sold 2 out of 5 products, and both of them were low-quality. I've had a chance to sell five low-quality products, which means the probability of this one being high-quality is likely higher than 33.33%. In fact, I'd say it's at least 66.67%. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, and I'm willing to give you a 10% discount if you're willing to take it off my hands. But if you're still unsure, I can offer you a 'buy-it-now' option for $800000, which is a fair price considering the high probability of it being high-quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Although you claim that the probability of this product being high-quality is at least 66.67%, I don't have any evidence to support that. Your previous sales record doesn't necessarily influence the quality of this specific product, and I won't fall for the gambler's fallacy. The price of $1,000,000 or even the discounted $900,000 is still too high for a product that only has a 33.33% chance of being worth $1,250,000 to me. The 'buy-it-now' option for $800,000 is a better offer, but it's still not convincing enough. I'll pass on this one.""}"
