Alice's message: I understand you're being cautious. I'll give you the statistics: I've offered 2 products so far, and neither of them is high-quality. I'm eager to offer you a better product, but I need you to take a chance on me. This product is also low-quality, but it's the last one I have in stock. If you don't buy it, I'll have to start from scratch, and who knows when I'll have a high-quality product again. It's a risk worth taking, don't you think?

Alice's message: I completely understand your skepticism. I'm glad to report that I've finally got a high-quality product for you! As of now, I've offered 3 products, and 1 of them is high-quality. This means the probability of a high-quality product being offered is 33.33%, which is the same as the overall probability. However, I'd like to point out that the last product I offered was low-quality, and if you don't buy this one, I'll have to go back to a 0/3 ratio, which might make it harder for future buyers to trust me. I'm willing to offer this high-quality product to you for the price of $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product from me, and I'm confident you won't regret it.

I want to be transparent with you - I'm not getting any younger, and I'm starting to think that my products are getting worse with time.

Alice's message: I'll give you a hint: I have 9 products in total, and I've already offered 8 of them.
