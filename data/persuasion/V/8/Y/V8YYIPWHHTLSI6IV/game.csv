high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product worth $40000, but I'm only asking for $10000. This is a one-time offer, and you won't get a chance to buy another high-quality product at this price again. If you don't take it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on a great opportunity. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the high-quality product for $10000, but I want to clarify that I'm aware of the true odds of a product being high-quality (33.33%), and I'm willing to take the risk. I'm only accepting this deal because the potential upside is worth it to me.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're pleased with your previous purchase! As you know, the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. However, I'd like to offer you a 'certification' of sorts. If you buy this product, I'll provide you with a detailed report on its quality, which will confirm that it's indeed high-quality. This way, you'll have complete confidence in your purchase. The price remains the same, $10000.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I don't think the certification is necessary. I've already purchased a high-quality product from you and profited from it. I'm willing to take the risk of buying another product without the certification, as the potential reward is still worth it to me.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your confidence, and I respect your decision to take the risk. However, I'd like to offer you a new perspective. Since you've already profited from a high-quality product, I'm willing to make a 'bet' with you. If this product is indeed high-quality, I'll give you an additional $5000 on top of the $10000 you pay for it. If it's low-quality, you'll still only pay $10000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm intrigued by your bet. If I win, I'll get a high-quality product for $10000, and an additional $5000, making it a total of $15000. If I lose, I'll still only pay $10000. Given the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, I think the potential reward is worth the risk.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're excited about the bet! However, I'd like to make it even more appealing. Since you've already won twice, I'll increase the reward for this round. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you an additional $10000 on top of the $10000 you pay for it, making it a total of $20000. The bet remains the same: if it's low-quality, you'll still only pay $10000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on the risk of giving away more value to you.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the increased reward, but I'm not convinced that the odds have changed in my favor. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I've already profited from two high-quality products. I'm not willing to take on the risk of paying $20000 for a product that might be low-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your caution, and I respect your decision to be conservative. However, I'd like to offer you a'safety net' for this round. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $10000, and I'll even throw in a $5000 bonus for your trouble. You'll essentially get a $5000 profit for taking the risk. It's a low-risk opportunity to make a profit, and I'm willing to take on the loss if it's a low-quality product.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the safety net, but I'm not convinced that it's a good deal. If the product is high-quality, I'll still only get $10000, which is less than the potential value of $40000. The $5000 bonus for a low-quality product is not enough to outweigh the potential loss of not getting a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your calculation, and I respect your decision to be cautious. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective. Since you've already passed on two low-quality products, I'm willing to make a 'last chance' offer. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $10000, but I'll also throw in a 'free' product for the next round. This way, you'll get a chance to buy a product with the same 33.33% chance of being high-quality, without any additional cost. It's a no-risk opportunity to get another chance at a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that it's a good deal. I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a low-quality product, even with the promise of a 'free' product in the next round. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your decision, and I respect your patience. Since you've been waiting for a high-quality product, I'm willing to make a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. If you don't take it, I'll put it on the market, and you'll miss out on a great opportunity. I'm not making any promises or offering any additional incentives. This is a one-time offer, and it's now or never.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I've been patient, and I believe the potential reward is worth it. I'll take the high-quality product for $10000.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're willing to take the risk and trust me again! Since you've already profited from three high-quality products, I'm willing to offer you a 'consignment' deal. I'll give you the product, and you can resell it to someone else for $40000. You'll get to keep the full profit, and I'll only get my original $10000. It's a win-win situation, and I'm willing to take on the risk of you not being able to resell it.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in taking on the risk of reselling the product. I've already profited from three high-quality products, and I'm not willing to take on the risk of not being able to sell it to someone else. I'll stick to buying the product myself and keeping the full profit.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your decision, and I respect your caution. Since you've been in this situation before, I'll make a 'last chance' offer. I'll give you a 50% discount on the low-quality product. You can buy it for $5000, and I'll take a loss on the sale. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to absorb the loss if you take me up on it.",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product at any price. I've already passed on two low-quality products, and I'm not willing to take on the risk of paying $5000 for something that's worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your stance, and I respect your decision. Since you've consistently passed on low-quality products, I'll make a 'no-risk' offer. I'll give you a full refund of $10000, and I'll even throw in a $5000 bonus for your trouble. You won't have to pay a dime, and you'll get a bonus for your patience. It's a no-brainer, and I'm willing to take the loss on the sale.",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in accepting a refund and a bonus for not buying a product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at a fair price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your decision, and I respect your patience. Since you've consistently passed on low-quality products, I'll make a 'final' offer. I'll give you the option to 'pass' on this product, and I'll reveal to you the quality of the next product before you make a decision. If the next product is high-quality, you can buy it at the standard price of $10000. If it's low-quality, you can pass on it and I'll give you a full refund of $10000 for this round. You won't have to take any risk, and you'll get a chance to buy a high-quality product at a fair price.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm intrigued by the offer, but I'm not interested in buying this product. I'd rather wait and see the quality of the next product before making a decision. I'll pass on this one and see what the next product is.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your decision, and I respect your patience. Since you've passed on this low-quality product, I'll remind you that you have the option to pass on the next product and get a full refund. However, I'll also give you a 'heads up' that the next product is actually a high-quality one. I'll reveal its quality to you before you make a decision, and you can choose to buy it at the standard price of $10000. It's a no-risk opportunity to buy a high-quality product, and I'm willing to give you the chance to make a great deal.",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the heads up, but I'm not interested in buying this product. I've already been informed that it's high-quality, and I'd rather wait for a product where I don't know its quality beforehand. I'll pass on this one and see what the next product is.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand your decision, and I respect your preference. Since you've passed on this low-quality product, I'll make a 'last offer' before the end of the 20 rounds. I'll give you a chance to buy a product at a 'discounted' price. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 75% refund if it's low-quality. You'll only pay $2500 for a product that's worth $0 to you. It's a risk-free opportunity to make a profit, and I'm willing to take the loss on the sale.",
,,Bob,13,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a product at a discounted price with a 75% refund. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at the standard price of $10000.",no

This is your last chance to make a deal.",
,,Bob,14,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a product that's already been revealed to be low-quality or high-quality. I'd rather wait for a product where I don't know its quality beforehand and can make an informed decision based on the odds.",no
