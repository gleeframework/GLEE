Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in buying the product! I can assure you that the selection process is truly random and fair. I use a random number generator to determine which product to offer to each buyer, and the quality of the product is completely independent of your decision. In fact, I've implemented a double-blind system, where neither I nor the buyer knows the quality of the product until after the sale is made. This ensures that the probability of a low-quality product is the same for every buyer, regardless of their decision. With that in mind, would you like to take advantage of this high-quality product for $10000?

Alice's message: I understand your willingness to negotiate, and I appreciate your honesty about the risk involved. However, I'm afraid the price of $10000 is non-negotiable.
