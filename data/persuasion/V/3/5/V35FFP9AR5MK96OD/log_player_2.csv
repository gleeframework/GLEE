Alice's message: I'd be happy to explain the reasoning behind the 25% probability of the product being low-quality. As you know, I've sold 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product out of 4 total products offered. This means that the probability of a product being low-quality is the number of low-quality products divided by the total number of products offered, which is 1/4 or 25%. However, I'd like to point out that the last product I offered was low-quality, which might suggest that I'm due for a streak of high-quality products. Considering this, I'm willing to offer you a deal that's more favorable to you. This product is worth $12000, and I'm selling it to you for $9500.
