"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Since Alice is trying to sell the product, her recommendation is not necessarily reliable. 
* **High Expected Value:** Even though there is a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential gain of a high-quality product ($30,000) outweighs the potential loss ($10,000). The expected value of buying is: 0.8 * $30,000 - 0.2 * $10,000 = $22,000. This is a positive expected value, making it worthwhile to buy. 

**Therefore, it makes sense to buy the product in the first round to see how the game unfolds.**"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty. I'm going to pass on this one.  Let's see what's next!""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is not recommending the product, which suggests she might have an inkling it's low quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a chance the product is high quality, the potential loss outweighs the potential gain. The expected value of buying is: 0.2 * $30,000 - 0.8 * $10,000 = -$2,000. This is a negative expected value.

**It's better to be cautious and pass on the product in this round, as the risk is not worth the potential reward.**"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty. I'm going to pass on this one too.  Let's see what's next!""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is still not recommending the product, which reinforces the possibility of a low-quality product.
* **Previous Round's Outcome:** The previous round confirmed Alice's recommendation was accurate. Passing on the product, even though it might have been high quality, was the right call.
* **Risk Management:** While there's always a chance the product could be high quality, the risk of buying a low-quality product is too high, especially since Alice is not recommending it.

**It's safer to pass on the product again, as the potential loss outweighs the potential gain.**"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty. I'm going to pass on this one. I'm starting to see a pattern here, and I don't want to take any unnecessary risks.  Let's see what's next!""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice continues to not recommend the product, suggesting it's likely low quality.
* **Consistent Pattern:** Three rounds in a row have resulted in low-quality products when Alice didn't recommend them. This reinforces the pattern and makes it statistically more likely the current product is also low quality.
* **Risk Aversion:** With the information gathered so far, it's more advantageous to play it safe and pass on the product. The potential loss of buying a low-quality product outweighs the potential gain of buying a high-quality product. 

**It's wise to stick to the established pattern and pass on the product, especially considering the limited number of rounds remaining.**"
