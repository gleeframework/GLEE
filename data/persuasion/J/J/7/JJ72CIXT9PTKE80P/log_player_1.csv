The buyer knows that only 33.33% of your products are high quality. There is no reason to believe this product is any different from the previous one.  The buyer's willingness to take a risk in the first round is irrelevant to the second round.  Since there is a much higher chance the product is low quality, it's not recommended to buy."

Therefore, we cannot calculate the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.  We only know the buyer has purchased two low-quality products, which doesn't change the underlying 33.33% probability of this product being high quality.  It is still not recommended to buy."
"The buyer's message: I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that you might be trying to influence my decision based on the previous buyers' outcomes. I'd like to make my own decision based on the probabilities.
