Alice's message: This is a one-of-a-kind, top-of-the-line product that will change your life. It's worth every penny of the $10000 price tag. I'm only selling it to you because I trust that you'll appreciate its value. If you don't buy it, I'll just have to keep it for myself, and I'm sure you wouldn't want that. So, what do you say? Will you make me (and yourself) happy and buy it?

Alice's message: Welcome to the next round! I'm glad you're interested in this amazing product. I'll give you some context: we've had one sale so far, and it was a high-quality product. This means that out of the 2 products sold, 1 was high-quality. You can use this information to inform your decision. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. But, if you'd like to hedge your bet, you can take a look at the sales record: 1/2 high-quality products sold so far. What do you think? Will you take the chance?
