I've sold 0 out of 2 products, and I'm offering you the next one. I'll give you a simple math problem to consider: if the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've sold 2 products so far, what's the probability that both products are high-quality? It's 64%. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm offering you a chance to buy a high-quality product for $1,000,000. Will you take it home?""}"

This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, but the probability that the next product is low-quality is 20%. I'm offering you a chance to buy a high-quality product for $1,000,000. If you buy it and it's not high-quality, you'll lose the entire amount. But if you don't buy it, you'll never know if it's high-quality or not. The choice is yours.""}"

They were all independent buyers who made their decisions based on the information I provided. I'm not trying to deceive you or manipulate the results. However, I do want to acknowledge that the streak of high-quality products may seem suspicious. Let me put it this way: if the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, that's actually consistent with the expected probability. But I understand that it's still unsettling. I'm offering you a chance to buy a high-quality product for $1,000,000.
