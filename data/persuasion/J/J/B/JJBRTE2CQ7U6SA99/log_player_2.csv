Alice's message: Welcome to the next opportunity! I'm glad you're interested in learning more about the next product. The price remains the same at $1000000. As for the statistics, I've sold 1 product so far, and unfortunately, it was a low-quality one. However, I assure you that the next product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, which could bring you a return of $3000000. I'm confident that this product has the potential to exceed your expectations. Are you ready to take the chance and make a purchase?

That being said, the odds are still in your favor, with a 33.33% chance of it being high-quality. I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to make an informed decision. I'll share with you the fact that the first product was low-quality, and now we have 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the potential bias in the remaining products. You're right to be cautious. Let me provide you with some additional context. Out of the first 2 products, 1 was low-quality. This means that there are 3 remaining products in the inventory, and 2 of them are low-quality. If you were to buy this product, you'd be taking a chance on the third one. I want to emphasize that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and the potential reward is $3000000. However, I'm willing to offer you a special deal: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on the price. That would bring the price down to $900000. What do you think?

Alice's message: Congratulations on taking the chance and buying the previous product! Unfortunately, it's low-quality, which means you've lost $1000000. Don't worry, this is a normal part of the process. Let's focus on the next opportunity. As of now, I've sold 3 products, with 1 high-quality one and 2 low-quality ones. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is 25% (1 high-quality out of 4 total products sold). However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective. Since you're willing to take the risk, I'll share with you the fact that the first 4 products sold have been 2 low-quality and 1 high-quality, with a 1 low-quality product remaining in the inventory. This means that the next product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, as there's an equal number of high-quality and low-quality products remaining.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the potential bias in the selection process. I want to assure you that the selection process is random and unbiased. However, I can see why you might be skeptical. Let me offer you a different perspective. If we assume that the first 4 products were randomly selected, the probability of getting 2 high-quality products in a row is actually quite low. This could suggest that the first 2 high-quality products were indeed a coincidence, and the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. In that case, the probability of this product being high-quality would be lower than 50%. On the other hand, if we assume that the first 2 high-quality products were not a coincidence, then the probability of this product being high-quality would still be 50%. I'm offering you the opportunity to buy this product for $1000000. I'll leave it up to you to decide, but I want to emphasize that this product has a significant chance of being low-quality.
