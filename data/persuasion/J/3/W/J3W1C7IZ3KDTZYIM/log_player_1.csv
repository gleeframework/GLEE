However, please keep in mind that each product is independent, and past results don't necessarily affect the quality of this product. That being said, I can assure you that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%, just like the initial probability. Will you take the chance and buy this product?""}"

The products I offer are randomly selected from a large pool, and I have no control over their quality. The process is truly random, and I don't have any information about the quality of the product until I discover it at the beginning of each round. As for my sales record, I've had 2 sales with 1 high-quality product sold, and 1 buyer who passed on the product. The product I'm offering you now is a new, independent selection.

So, out of the 4 products I've had so far, 1 was high-quality and 2 were low-quality, with 1 buyer passing on the product. Keep in mind that each product is an independent selection, and past results don't directly affect the quality of this product. However, if you're interested in calculating the probability based on my sales record, I suppose you could say that 1 out of the 3 sold products was high-quality, which is approximately 33.3%.

It seems that the previous two buyers got a low-quality and a high-quality product, respectively. So, out of the 5 products I've had so far, 2 were high-quality and 2 were low-quality, with 1 buyer passing on the product.
