This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, I know the product is high-quality.  Since the buyer doesn't know this, and the price is fixed,  I should recommend buying. The buyer only knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, so there's a good chance they'll value the high-quality product more than the $100 price."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I know this product is low-quality. Even though the buyer doesn't, they now know that I sold one high-quality product in the previous round. This strengthens their belief that my products are likely lower quality than they initially thought.  It's not in my best interest to recommend a low-quality product at this point, as they are less likely to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Given the low rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm going to pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

```

**Reasoning:**

I know this product is low-quality.  The buyer has seen one high-quality and one low-quality product so far.  This information reinforces their perception that my products are likely not worth the price.  It's unlikely they will buy a product I recommend at this point, as they are more aware of the risk."

I know this product is low-quality. The buyer has now witnessed three rounds, with only one high-quality product. Their skepticism about the value of my products is likely even higher now. Recommending a low-quality product at this point would almost certainly result in another rejection. It's better to hold off on the recommendation and wait for a better opportunity."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one. Based on the limited data, the odds seem stacked against me getting a high-quality product.  I'll wait and see what happens with future offers.

**Reasoning:**

Even though I've only sold one high-quality product out of four, this is a high-quality product.  The buyer has seen a pattern of low-quality products, and they're likely hesitant. But this time, I have to play the odds. There's a chance the buyer will be swayed by the fact that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, regardless of my past sales. They might be willing to take a chance, especially if they value a high-quality product highly."

However, they are aware of the probability of a high-quality product (33.33%) and are likely more cautious after seeing several low-quality products.
