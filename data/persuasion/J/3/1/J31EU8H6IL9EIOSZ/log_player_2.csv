**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal.
* **Perfect Record:**  A 100% success rate (6/6) for high-quality products sold is a remarkable track record.  
* **High Expected Value:** Even with the risk of a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($200) outweighs the potential loss ($0). 

While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the data strongly suggests a high probability of getting a good deal."
