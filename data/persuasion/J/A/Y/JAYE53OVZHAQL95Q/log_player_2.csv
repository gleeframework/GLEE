"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the value of each product to you, and she recommends buying, it's likely that the product is high-quality. Even if there's a chance it's low-quality, the potential payoff of $200 outweighs the risk of getting a product worth $0. This is a gamble worth taking in the first round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your advice, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator of the product's quality.  Since she didn't recommend buying, it's very likely the product is low-quality. It's not worth risking $100 for a product that's probably worth nothing to me."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads-up, Alice. I'll pass on this one too.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is again a strong indicator.  Two rounds in a row without a recommendation means it's highly likely the product is low-quality. It's not worth the risk."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your honesty, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Three rounds in a row without a recommendation from Alice means the product is highly likely to be low-quality.  I'm not willing to risk $100 on a product that is probably worth nothing to me."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I'll trust your judgment this time and buy it. Let's see what we have!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice has not recommended buying for the past three rounds, this is a new product. Her recommendation now could be a sign that the product is indeed high-quality.  While there's still a risk, the potential payoff of $200 justifies taking the chance."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice recommended a product in the previous round, her current recommendation is to not buy. This is a clear sign that the product is likely low-quality. While there is a small chance it could be high-quality, it's not worth risking $100 on such a low probability."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your honesty, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has not recommended buying for the past two rounds, suggesting that the product is likely low-quality. There's no reason to take the risk on a product that is very likely worth nothing to me."

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads-up, Alice. I'll pass on this one. Seems like it's best to follow your recommendations.""}
```

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads-up, Alice. I'll pass on this one. It's safer to trust your judgment at this point.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has not recommended buying for four rounds in a row. This pattern strongly suggests that the product is very likely to be low-quality.  I'm not willing to risk $100 on a product that is probably worth nothing. It's safer to pass and wait for a potential recommendation in the future."

```

**Reasoning:**

Five rounds in a row without a recommendation from Alice is a strong indicator that the product is likely low-quality. At this point, it's more likely to lose money than gain anything by buying. It's safer to pass and wait for a potential recommendation in the future."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has not recommended buying for six rounds in a row, and that's a very strong indicator that the product is likely low-quality.  I've learned from the game that her recommendations are a good predictor of the product's value, and it's better to be cautious than to risk losing money. I'll continue to pass on any products until she recommends one."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has not recommended buying for seven rounds in a row, solidifying the pattern that she generally only recommends high-quality products.

```

**Reasoning:**

This is a big gamble! Alice hasn't recommended buying in seven rounds, but she's suddenly recommending this one. It's highly likely this is a high-quality product. While there's still a chance it could be low-quality, the potential payoff of $200 makes the risk worth taking."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice recommended the previous product and is recommending this one as well. This pattern suggests that she is indeed recommending high-quality products.
