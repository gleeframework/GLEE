"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk.  Alice's recommendation doesn't change the inherent probabilities, but it does provide some information that we should consider. Since she knows the value of each product, her recommendation is likely based on it being high quality. It's a gamble, but a calculated one with a potentially large payoff."

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads up, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation carries weight because she knows the true value of the products.  Her lack of recommendation strongly suggests the current product is likely low quality.  While there's still a chance it could be high quality, the risk is too high considering the potential loss. It's better to pass and wait for a more promising opportunity."

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's recommendation was wrong in the previous round, it doesn't negate its value.  Her recommendation is still based on her knowledge of the product's quality.  The odds are still in our favor (80% chance of high quality), and a high-quality product is a significant gain.  It's a risk, but a calculated one."
