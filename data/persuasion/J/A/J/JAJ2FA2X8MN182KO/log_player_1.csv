"The buyer's message: I see that you claim to have sold 3 high-quality products, but the statistics I have access to say that only 1 high-quality product has been sold. This discrepancy makes me question the accuracy of your claims. Given the initial probabilities of 33.33% for a high-quality product and 66.67% for a low-quality product, and considering the conflicting information, I'm inclined to trust the statistics I have. Therefore, I will not take the risk and choose not to buy the product.
