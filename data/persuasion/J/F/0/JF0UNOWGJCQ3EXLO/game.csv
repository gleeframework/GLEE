,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for a more favorable situation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers did not buy the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm assuming you wouldn't recommend it if it's high-quality, so I'll wait for a better opportunity."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a 50% discount. I know you know how much it's worth to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, but I'd like a better price for the chance to buy a high-quality one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and the fact that you're recommending it. This suggests that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality based on your previous sales record, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when I could potentially get a high-quality product worth $120. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I think it's likely that the product is low-quality, given that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the products recommended so far are likely to be low-quality. I would like to pass on this product to see if I can get a better recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm not buying based on your recommendation. I'm going to pass on this product.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous 5 buyers all purchased the products despite your recommendations, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I think it's unlikely that the next product would be high-quality as well. I'd rather not risk buying a low-quality product for $100."
