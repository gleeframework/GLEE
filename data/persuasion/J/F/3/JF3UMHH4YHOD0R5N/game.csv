low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales data. Can you share the probability with me?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous two buyers who bought the products didn't get high-quality ones. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics and Alice's recommendation. I think there's a high chance it's low-quality, but I'll take the chance since I don't have any information that suggests it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'm curious, can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold to the total number of products sold so far?"

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think it's likely to be low quality based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is very low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the current statistics, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, which is a strong indication that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
