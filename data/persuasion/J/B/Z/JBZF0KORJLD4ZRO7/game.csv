,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product for $10000. I'm willing to give you a free upgrade to a product of your choice if you buy this one. The upgrade will be offered after you've seen the quality of the product you're buying now. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only offering it because I believe in the value of this product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the product, but I'd like to clarify that the free upgrade offer is contingent on the product being of high quality. If it's low quality, I'll still buy the current product, but the upgrade offer is void.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're excited about the potential upgrade offer! Now that you've seen the quality of the first product, I'd like to give you a bit more information about this new product. I've noticed that you're a savvy buyer, and I think you'll appreciate the value of this high-quality product. I'm willing to give you a 10% discount on this product, which brings the price down to $9000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm not willing to commit to buying a product without knowing its quality. I'd like to wait and see what the product is before making a decision.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your caution, and I respect your decision to wait and see. However, I'd like to offer you a different approach. Since you've already seen that the previous product was low-quality, I'm willing to give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's also low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. But if it's high-quality, as it is now, I'll give you an additional 5% discount, bringing the price down to $8550. This way, you have nothing to lose, and you'll get an even better deal if the product is high-quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm willing to take you up on your guarantee. I'll buy the product, but I want to make it clear that I'm only doing so because of the refund guarantee. If it's low-quality, I expect the full refund as promised.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad we could work out a deal that made you feel comfortable. Now, I want to acknowledge that you're a savvy buyer who values fairness and transparency. With that in mind, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to 'bet' on the quality of the next product. If you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you an additional 10% discount, bringing the price down to $9000. But if it's low-quality, I'll give you a 5% discount, bringing the price down to $9500. You get to choose which discount you prefer, and I'll honor it regardless of the product's quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in the 'bet' offer. I've already gotten a good deal on the previous product, and I'm not willing to take on the risk of a potentially lower discount if the product is low-quality. I'd rather wait and see the quality of the product before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your caution, and I respect your decision to wait and see. However, I'd like to offer you a different approach. Since you've already seen two products, and one of them was low-quality, I'm willing to give you a 'price adjustment' based on the overall quality of the products you've seen so far. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 5% discount on the next product, regardless of its quality. This way, you'll get a better deal on the next product, and you'll have a chance to see the quality of this product before making a decision. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,I'm not interested in the 'price adjustment' offer. I'd rather have a clear understanding of the quality of the product before committing to a purchase. I'd like to wait and see what the product is before making a decision.,no

,,Alice,9,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision to wait and see. However, I'd like to offer you a 'fresh start'.
