Alice's message: I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product for $10000. I'm willing to give you a free upgrade to a product of your choice if you buy this one. The upgrade will be offered after you've seen the quality of the product you're buying now. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only offering it because I believe in the value of this product. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product, but I'd like to clarify that the free upgrade offer is contingent on the product being of high quality.

But if it's high-quality, as it is now, I'll give you an additional 5% discount, bringing the price down to $8550.
