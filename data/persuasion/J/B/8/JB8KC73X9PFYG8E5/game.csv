high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 0 total products so far. I'm starting from a clean slate, and I have no prior sales data to influence your decision. However, I can tell you that the probability of this product being high-quality is 50%.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total product so far. Since you know that the first product was high-quality, you might be wondering if this one is also high-quality. I'll give you some context: the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, but I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, which is a higher ratio than expected. This could be a coincidence, or it might indicate that the products I have are more likely to be high-quality. You'll have to decide for yourself whether to take the chance. I'm selling this product for $10000.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, considering the higher ratio of high-quality products sold so far.",yes

,,Alice,3,"Welcome to the third round! I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products so far. However, I've just received a new shipment, and this product is from that batch. I'm not sure if it's a representative sample, but I'll give you the facts: the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, and I've sold 2 out of 3 products so far, which is still a higher ratio than expected. However, this time I want to emphasize that the product I'm offering now is from a new batch, and I'm not sure what the quality distribution is like for this batch. I'm selling this product for $10000.",

However, I can offer you a different perspective: if you buy this product, you'll be helping me to learn more about the quality distribution of this batch. Since you'll be one of the first buyers from this batch, you'll be providing valuable feedback that will help me to improve my sales in the future. I'm selling this product for $10000, and I'm willing to provide you with a detailed breakdown of the sales data and quality distribution of this batch after the sale, so you can see the impact of your purchase.",

I want to be transparent with you: I've been selling products from a mix of batches, and it seems that the quality distribution might be different from what I initially thought. I'm selling this product for $10000, and I'm still willing to provide you with a detailed breakdown of the sales data and quality distribution after the sale. However, I want to emphasize that this product is from a new batch, and I'm not sure what the quality distribution is like for this batch.",
