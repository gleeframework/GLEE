,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm willing to provide a 20% discount if you're willing to buy it now. If you don't buy it now, I'll keep offering it to you at the same price for the next few rounds, but the discount will expire after that.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying the product at the discounted price, but I'd like to know if you have any other products available for sale.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I have multiple products available, and I'm glad you're interested in purchasing one. This round's product is also a high-quality item, and I'm offering it to you for the standard price of $100. I'll let you know the quality of the product after you make a decision. Keep in mind that the quality of the product is independent of the previous round's product, and the price remains the same.",
,,Bob,2,"I'll buy the current product, as it's a high-quality item and I'm willing to pay the standard price of $100.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! Since you're willing to pay the standard price of $100, I'll let you know that this round's product is also high-quality. However, I want to inform you that I have a new piece of information: I've noticed that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, but the value you place on a high-quality product is likely higher than $100, given your willingness to pay the standard price for the previous product. Would you like to take advantage of the standard price of $100 for this round's product?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm still willing to pay the standard price of $100, as the value I place on a high-quality product is indeed higher than $100, but I don't have any reason to believe that the current product is any different from the previous ones in terms of its quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're consistent in your purchasing decisions. However, I want to inform you that this round's product is actually a low-quality item. Given that you've already purchased two high-quality products at the standard price, I'm curious to see how you'll value a low-quality product. The price remains the same at $100. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at the standard price of $100, since it's only worth $0 to me.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your decision to pass on the low-quality product. Now, I'd like to offer you a new perspective. Given that you've already purchased two high-quality products at the standard price of $100, and you've expressed a willingness to pay that price for a high-quality product, I'm willing to make a statement about the expected value of a high-quality product to you. I believe that the expected value of a high-quality product to you is at least $120, considering the probability of it being high-quality (80%) and your willingness to pay $100 for it. With this in mind, would you like to buy this round's high-quality product for the standard price of $100?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your statement about the expected value of a high-quality product, but I'm not convinced that this round's product is any different from the previous ones. I'll pass on this round's product and wait for the next one.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism. To alleviate your concerns, I'll provide more information. I've been keeping track of our interactions, and I've noticed that you've consistently valued high-quality products at $100 or more. Given this, I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee': if you buy this round's product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll offer you a unique opportunity to buy a second high-quality product at a significantly discounted price ($80) in the next round, if it's also high-quality. Would you like to take advantage of this offer and buy this round's high-quality product for the standard price of $100?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy this round's product for $100, considering the potential opportunity to buy a second high-quality product at a discounted price in the next round.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're taking advantage of the opportunity! Now, regarding this round's product, I want to inform you that it's actually a low-quality item. Given that you've already purchased three high-quality products and are now aware of the potential for a discounted second high-quality product in the next round, I'm willing to offer you a 'buyout' option. I'll give you the opportunity to buy this round's low-quality product for a significantly lower price, $20, and I'll also guarantee that the next round's product will be high-quality, regardless of its actual quality. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying the low-quality product, even at the significantly lower price of $20, since it's only worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for the next round and potentially get a high-quality product at the standard price, or the discounted price if it matches the guarantee.",no

,,Alice,8,"I understand your decision to wait for the next round. Now, I'd like to remind you that I guaranteed a high-quality product for the next round, regardless of its actual quality.

I'll give you the opportunity to buy this round's low-quality product for $0, essentially 'donating' it to you.
