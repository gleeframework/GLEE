high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both of them did not buy, I'm suspicious that the products were low quality and Alice is trying to trick me into buying a low-quality product. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low-quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, and considering the low probability of a high-quality product, I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 80% and I'd gain $2000000 if it is."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. Can you provide the exact numbers on the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far?
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, considering the previous buyers were recommended to buy and they all passed, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. Therefore, I'm skeptical and would like to pass on this product."
