low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm going to go against your recommendation and buy the product. I know you don't know the value of the product to me, but I have to make a decision based on the information I have, and the fact that the previous 3 buyers, who had access to your recommendations, only bought 1 high-quality product out of 3, suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than 33.33%. I'm hoping to get a good deal!"
