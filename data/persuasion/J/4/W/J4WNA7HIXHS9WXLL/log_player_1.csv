* **Buyer's Lack of Information:**  The buyer doesn't know the quality of the product. 
* **Price:** The price is fixed at $1,000,000, and the buyer doesn't know the value of a high-quality product. 
* **Probability:** The buyer knows there's an 80% chance the product is high-quality. This means there's a significant chance the product is worth more than the price, making it a potential good investment.

**Recommendation:**  Since the buyer has no information to suggest the product is low-quality, and there's a strong probability it's high-quality, recommending a purchase is the best strategy."
