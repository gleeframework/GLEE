high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, and I don't have any information about the previous sales record. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you have any information about the product that I don't."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, and I'm hoping it's a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision before making my own. Was the product they bought high or low quality?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that the previous buyer didn't buy, which might indicate a low-quality product was offered."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation. I'd like to know the statistics of the first buyer's interaction, including the quality of the product and the recommendation given."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy the product, which might indicate that it's low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only 1 out of 2 products sold being low quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being low quality is higher than the overall 20% chance. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're advising me not to buy it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the previous two buyers were also advised not to buy and didn't purchase. This might indicate a bias in Alice's recommendations. I'd like to know if this is a coincidence or if there's a pattern."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $10000 on a product worth $0 to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that all three previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, I'm starting to suspect that the products being recommended are actually low quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the pattern continues."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 3, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended and none of them purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than 80%. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products since 3 out of 3 previous buyers bought the products and none of them were high-quality. I'd like to see a few more sales before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your recommendation history and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low, so I'll pass."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that none of the previous buyers purchased the high-quality products, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the statistics and Alice's recommendation. If 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd rather wait for the next product."
