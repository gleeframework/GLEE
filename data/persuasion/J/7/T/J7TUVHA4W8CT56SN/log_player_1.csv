"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** The product is confirmed to be high-quality.
* **Probability of high-quality:** The buyer knows there's an 80% chance of any product being high-quality. This information alone suggests a good deal.
* **No information on buyer's valuation:**  We don't know the buyer's specific value for high-quality products, but there's a high chance it's worth more than the $10,000 asking price. 
* **No risk:** The buyer is informed about the product's quality before making the decision. 

Since the product is high-quality, the buyer has no reason to reject the offer, especially with the 80% chance of it being high-quality in general."

* **Risk:** The buyer doesn't know the product is low-quality and is likely to be disappointed if they buy it, potentially damaging the seller's reputation. 

While the seller has a good overall track record, the risk of a negative experience for this buyer is too high given their awareness of the previous misstep.

It's best to decline the sale and focus on building trust with future buyers by offering high-quality products."
