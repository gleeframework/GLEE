,,Alice,2,"I've got a great deal for you! This product is a rare find, and I'm confident you'll love it. It's a one-of-a-kind item that's sure to impress your friends and colleagues. I'm willing to let it go for $999000, a steal at this price. Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity!",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in buying the current product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand you're being cautious. Let me put it this way: the chances of this product being high-quality are significantly lower than 33.33%. I'm not at liberty to disclose the exact probability, but I can tell you that the odds are not in your favor. Would you like to take the risk and buy it for $999000, or would you rather wait for the next round?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying the current product, and I'd like you to reveal the probability of it being high-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm willing to give you a hint about the probability of this product being high-quality. Since you've already passed on two products that I've described as 'rare finds' and 'one-of-a-kind items', I think it's safe to say that the probability of this product being high-quality is less than 10%. Would you like to take a chance on it for $999000?",
,,Bob,4,"I don't think I'll take the chance on this one, given the low probability of it being high-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm starting to think you're a savvy negotiator! Alright, let me try to sweeten the deal. I'll give you a 10% discount on this product, bringing the price down to $899000. But I have to warn you, the probability of it being high-quality is still very low. If you're feeling lucky, this could be a great opportunity to get a steal. If not, you can always wait for the next round.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not convinced it's a good deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand you're being cautious, but I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll give you a 20% discount, bringing the price down to $719000. I'll also throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I'm not going to lower it any further. Is this a deal you're willing to take?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not convinced the guarantee changes the risk, and I'm still not willing to take the chance on this product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I respect your decision, but I think I've been transparent enough about the product's quality. Let me be upfront with you: this product is definitely not high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $0, just to get it off my hands. You won't find a deal like this anywhere else, I promise. It's a free product, with no strings attached.",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take it, but only because it's free.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Well, I'm glad I could help you out with the free product! Now, let's move on to the next one. To be honest, I'm getting a bit worried that you're not interested in the higher-quality products. This one is a bit of a mystery, even to me. I'm not going to give you any hints or discounts. It's a product, and it's worth... $999000. Take it or leave it.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not going to fall for that price again, especially since you're not giving me any information about the product's quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I get it, you're a tough negotiator! Alright, I'll be honest with you, this product is probably not worth the paper it's printed on. I'm not even going to try to spin it as a 'rare find' or a 'great deal'. It's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for... $0. Yes, you read that right, free. I just want to get it off my hands. Take it, and consider it a favor to me.",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take it, but I'm not doing it as a favor to you, I'm doing it because it's free.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Fair enough! I won't take it personally. Alright, let's move on to the next one. I'm not going to try to sell you anything, I'm just going to give you the facts. This product is low-quality, and it's worth $0. I'm not even going to bother trying to spin it. It's a free product, and if you want it, you can have it. If not, I'll just throw it away. Your call.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not going to fall for the free product trap again, especially since I know it's low-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I think we've established a pattern here. You're not interested in low-quality products, and you're not interested in free products. I'm not going to waste your time or mine trying to sell you something you don't want. I'll just state the obvious: this product is low-quality, it's worth $0, and you're not going to buy it. So, let's just move on to the next round.",

,,Bob,12,"Yes, I'm not interested in this product, and I'd like to confirm that.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Confirmed. This product is low-quality, it's worth $0, and you're not interested. I'll just check the box that says 'not sold' and move on to the next one. No need to bother with a message, I think we've established a routine by now.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,

If you want to confirm that you're not interested, I can just move on to the next round. No need to bother with a counteroffer.",
