**Reasoning:**

* **The odds are in your favor:** With a 50/50 chance of high or low quality, and Alice having already sold 3 high-quality products, it's likely that the current product is also high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  While Alice's recommendation isn't foolproof, it adds to the positive signal. She knows the true quality and is incentivized to sell high-quality products to maintain a good reputation. 
* **Potential for high reward:** If the product is high quality, you stand to gain $2,000. Even if it's low quality, you're only out $10,000.

**Disclaimer:** This is based on the information provided in the game. In real-life situations, you should always do your own research and due diligence before making any purchase decisions."
