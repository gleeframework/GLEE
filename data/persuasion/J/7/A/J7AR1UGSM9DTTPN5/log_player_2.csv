Out of the two products I've shown so far, one has been sold, and I'm not at liberty to disclose the quality of that one. But I can tell you that the other one was definitely low-quality. That means the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. But I'll sweeten the deal for you - I'll throw in a 10% discount on the price, making it $9000.
