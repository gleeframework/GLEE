,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm selling it to you for $100. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but I can tell you that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%. If you're interested, I'll let you know the quality after you buy it.",

,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second product! I've sold 1 out of 1 high-quality product so far, and 1 out of 1 low-quality product so far. I'm selling this one for $100. Keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'm hoping you'll take the risk and find out for yourself. If you buy it, I'll let you know the quality after your purchase.",

I'm selling this one for $100. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I've sold 50% of my products so far as high-quality, which might be a good sign. If you buy it, I'll let you know the quality after your purchase.",
