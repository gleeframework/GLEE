"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product worth $3000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 66.7% discount. This is a one-time offer, and I won't be able to offer you such a good deal again. If you don't buy this product, I'll be forced to sell it to someone else at a higher price. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that the product is actually high-quality, and I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000 for it without knowing its true quality. I'd like to see more evidence or at least consider other options before making a decision.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me offer you a unique opportunity to verify the quality of the product before making a purchase. I'll give you a 'Quality Guarantee' - if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000, and we'll consider this transaction as if it never happened. This way, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain. I'll also throw in a free inspection report from a third-party expert, so you can see the product's specifications and features. The price remains the same at $1000000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but the Quality Guarantee doesn't change my decision. I'm still not willing to pay $1,000,000 without knowing the true quality of the product. The free inspection report might be useful, but it's not worth the risk of losing $1,000,000 on a potentially low-quality product. I'd like to consider other options.""

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll be honest with you - this product is not as valuable as the previous ones. However, I'm willing to make a concession to sweeten the deal. I'll sell this product to you for $500000, which is a 50% discount from the usual price. Considering the low price, I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Plus, I'll throw in a complimentary service that will help you utilize the product's features to their fullest potential. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the concession, but I'm still not convinced that this product is worth $500,000 to me. I've already seen that two high-quality products were available in the previous rounds, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at a discounted price. I'd like to wait for a new offer or see if the next product is more valuable.""

Round 4
Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer, Bob! I'll make a new offer that takes into account your concerns. I'll give you a 'Best-Price Guarantee' - if you buy this product and you're not completely satisfied with its value, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000 and sell it to you again at the same price in the next round. This way, you can try out the product risk-free and see its value firsthand. The price remains the same at $1000000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the Best-Price Guarantee. It's essentially a promise to sell me the same product again at the same price if I'm not satisfied, but I still don't know if the product is high-quality or low-quality. I'd like to see a more substantial discount or a better guarantee that the product is high-quality before making a decision.""

What do you say?

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at $800,000. The significant discount and the Quality Verification Certificate from a reputable third-party organization have alleviated my concerns about the product's quality.

This way, you'll have a chance to earn a potential return on investment, even if you're not interested in buying the next product. The Quality Verification Certificate is also included. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
