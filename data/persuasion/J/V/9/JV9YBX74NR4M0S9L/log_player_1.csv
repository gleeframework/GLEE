"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not convinced that the previous sale was truly random.

The buyer was aware of the risk and decided to take a chance. Since then, I've had a string of high-quality products, including the one I'm offering you now. The current statistics are: 6 out of 9 products sold are high-quality, with 3 low-quality products. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $10,000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm not willing to negotiate. What do you say? Will you take advantage of this chance to own a high-quality product?""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate the additional context, but I'm not willing to take the risk at this price. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I'd expect to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold by now if they were truly high-quality. The fact that 3 out of 9 products are low-quality suggests to me that the products may not be as high-quality as you claim.
