,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm willing to give you a 20% discount if you buy it now, but only if you confirm that you're interested. If you're not interested, I'll sell it to someone else for the full price.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not interested in buying the product at the current price. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is.,no

,,Alice,2,"I understand you're not interested in the previous product. I'm offering you a low-quality product for $1000000. I want to be transparent with you - I've been told by other customers that low-quality products from my company are usually worth around $200000 to them. I'm willing to sell this one to you for the full price of $1000000, but I'm also willing to throw in a 10% discount if you buy it now, which would bring the price down to $900000.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in buying the low-quality product, even with the discount. I'd rather wait for the next product.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've got a high-quality product for you, and I'm willing to make a bold claim: I'm offering it to you for the same price as the previous two products, $1000000. I want to ask you a question: if you were to buy this high-quality product, would you be willing to pay more than $1000000 for it? If your answer is yes, I'll give you a chance to negotiate the price. If your answer is no, I'll sell it to you at the listed price.",
,,Bob,3,I'm not willing to commit to paying more than $1000000 for the product. I'd like to wait and see what happens next.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand you're not willing to commit to a higher price. Given that you've seen two products and passed on both, I'm going to make an educated guess that you value high-quality products at around $800000. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $1000000, but I'll give you a 20% discount if you buy it now, bringing the price down to $800000. This is the same price I was willing to give you in the first round, and I think it's a fair offer considering the product's value.",
,,Bob,4,I'm not interested in buying the high-quality product at the discounted price of $800000. I think you're trying to trick me into buying at a price that's lower than what I'm willing to pay.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand you're cautious about my pricing strategy. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to trick you. Given that you're not interested in the high-quality product, I'll offer you a low-quality product for $1000000. However, I'll make a concession: I'll give you a 50% chance to return the product for a full refund if you're not satisfied with it. This way, you can try out the product without risking the full $1000000 upfront.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying the low-quality product, even with the return option. I'd rather wait for the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've got another low-quality product for you. I want to be upfront with you - I've already offered you two low-quality products, and you've passed on both. I'm starting to think that you might not be interested in buying low-quality products at all. If that's the case, I'm willing to make a deal with you: I'll sell you this low-quality product for $500000, which is half the original price. However, I'll also throw in a unique guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a heads-up when the next product is high-quality, so you can make an informed decision about whether to buy it or not.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying the low-quality product, even at the discounted price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product and take my chances.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've got a high-quality product for you, and I think I understand your strategy now. You're waiting for a high-quality product, and you're willing to take a chance on it. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $900000, which is $100000 less than the original price. I think this is a fair offer considering the risks you've taken so far, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the product.",
,,Bob,7,I'm not interested in buying the high-quality product at the discounted price. I think you're trying to get me to buy a high-quality product at a price that's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand you're still cautious about the price. I want to make one final offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $800000, which is the same price I offered in Round 4. I'm willing to match my previous offer because I believe this product is truly exceptional and will meet your expectations. If you pass on this offer, I'll be left with only two more chances to sell a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take that risk to make a sale.",
,,Bob,8,I'll take the high-quality product at $800000. I think it's a fair price considering the risks I've taken so far.,yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Congratulations on making a great decision! I'm glad you're satisfied with the high-quality product. Now, let's talk about the next one. I've got another high-quality product for you, and I want to make it clear that I'm willing to sell it to you at a price that reflects its true value. However, I also want to be transparent with you - I've already sold you one high-quality product, and I'm not sure if you'll be interested in buying another one at the same price. So, I'll offer you a choice: you can buy this high-quality product for $800000, just like the previous one, or you can negotiate the price with me. If you negotiate, I'll give you a chance to name a price, and we can work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand you're looking to negotiate the price of the high-quality product. I appreciate your willingness to work together to find a mutually agreeable price. As for the current product, I want to be upfront with you - it's a low-quality product, and I'm not sure if you'll be interested in buying it at any price. However, I'll make you a deal: I'll sell it to you for the same price as the high-quality product, $800000, but with a twist. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 50% refund if you return it to me within a week. This way, you can try it out and see if it meets your needs, and you'll have the option to return it if it doesn't.",

I believe this is a fair price considering the risks you've taken so far, and I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations. I'm also willing to throw in a bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a priority notification for the next high-quality product, so you'll be the first to know when it's available.",

I'm starting to think that you might be willing to buy a low-quality product at a much lower price. I'll make you a deal: I'll sell you this low-quality product for $400000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I'm willing to take a loss on this sale, but I want to make a sale and move on to the next product.",
