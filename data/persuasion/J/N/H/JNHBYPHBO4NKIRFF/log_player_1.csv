Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I'm glad you're interested in understanding my thought process. I'm not using any external information or calculations to adjust the probability of the product being high-quality. The probability remains at 80% based on the inherent quality of the product. The fact that the previous buyers passed on the product doesn't change the probability, but it does give you a chance to make a more informed decision. I've sold 1 high-quality product and 4 low-quality products now. You can think of the previous buyers' decisions as independent events that don't affect the probability of this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000.""
}"

}"

}"
