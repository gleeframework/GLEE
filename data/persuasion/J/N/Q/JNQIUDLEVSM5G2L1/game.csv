You're absolutely right, the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 33.33%, given my previous sales record. I guess I was just trying to be too honest and ended up being too harsh. Well, I suppose that's what I get for trying to be transparent. In any case, this product is still a low-quality item, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it. If you're feeling adventurous, you can take a chance on it for $50. But if not, I totally understand.",
