Alice's message: Welcome to my store! I'm glad you're interested in purchasing a product. As you may have noticed, my last customer was willing to take a chance on a product without knowing its quality. That's because I have a track record of selling high-quality products, and they were hoping to get lucky. However, I want to be upfront with you: I've just sold a product that turned out to be low-quality. This one might be the same. If you're feeling lucky, you can buy it for $1000000, but I want to warn you that the odds are against you.
