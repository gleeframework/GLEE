Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I understand your concerns. I'd like to offer you a new perspective. If I was trying to deceive you, wouldn't I have sold at least one high-quality product by now? I've had 6 chances to sell a high-quality product, and I've failed to do so. This suggests that I might actually be telling the truth about the low quality of the products. I have 16 products left, and I'm willing to offer you one of them for $1,000,000. Would you like to take a chance on it?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your argument, but I'd like to point out that your reasoning is based on the assumption that you would always reveal the truth about the product's quality. However, you could be lying about the quality of the products you've sold so far to make me believe that you're telling the truth about the current product. I'd like to propose a different strategy: why don't you offer me a guarantee that if I buy the product and it turns out to be low quality, I can get a full refund? This would allow me to mitigate the risk of buying a low-quality product and make a more informed decision.

However, if it turns out to be high-quality, the sale is final and non-refundable. This way, you can take on the risk of buying a low-quality product, but you'll get your money back if it doesn't meet your expectations.

}"
