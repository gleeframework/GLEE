low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since there's no prior data to go on. I'm willing to learn and see what the product is like."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 out of 1 product sold was low-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33% and the probability of being low-quality is 66.67%. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if I can get a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product. Given the low probability of a high-quality product (33.33%), I'd rather wait for the next product and potentially get a better deal."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product, I'm inclined to think that the previous product was likely low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendation. I'm concerned that if you recommended it, it might be a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if I buy it, I'll be more likely to get a low-quality product, and since only 1 of the first buyer purchased, the proportion of high-quality products sold might be skewed."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't trust your recommendation. I think you're trying to manipulate me into not buying, and I want to see for myself whether the product is high or low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think it's likely to be low quality and I can take advantage of the low price. If it's high quality, I'll be happy to pay the premium price, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'm going to take a chance based on my own assessment of the probabilities."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 4 buyers didn't find any high-quality products, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales. Is there any information available?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm suspicious that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to buy this product. Given that you haven't recommended it, I'm assuming it's a low-quality product, and I don't want to waste my money."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased against me, and I think the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33% due to the lack of sales so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk based on the low sales record of high-quality products so far."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have already purchased and none of the products were high quality, I'm skeptical about the likelihood of this product being high quality. The probability of the product being low quality is still 66.67%, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $100 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
