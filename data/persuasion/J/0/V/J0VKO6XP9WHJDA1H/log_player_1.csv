Here's why I recommend Bob buy the product:

* **Bob's Pattern:** Bob has established a pattern of buying products when you *don't* recommend them and passing when you *do* recommend them.  
* **Bob's Logic:** Bob's logic is sound â€“ he's using the information you provide to increase his chances of getting a high-quality product. 
* **Expected Value:** While there's always a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the 80% chance of getting a high-quality product for $400 makes this a good bet for Bob."
