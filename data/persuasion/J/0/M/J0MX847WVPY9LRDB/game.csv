,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is against it. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm hoping it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality, but I'd like to take the chance and see if I can get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced by the statistics and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered, given that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers have bought the product despite the low success rate of high-quality products, I'm suspicious that Alice is recommending low-quality products to all the buyers. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still quite low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000 when I know it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see a higher success rate before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product, which would indicate a higher chance of a high-quality product being available."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics you've provided so far."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that none of the previous buyers have bought a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one. I think you're trying to sell me a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 3 products, I'm inclined to think that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. However, I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality before making a final decision."

,,Alice,18,yes,

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has recommended 3 products to other buyers, and none of them were high-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is also low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
