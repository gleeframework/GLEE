**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on. We know that 1 out of 1 previous buyers purchased the product, and it was a high-quality product. This is a very small sample size.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product carries some weight, as she knows the true quality. 
* **Potential Gain vs. Risk:** Even though the odds are against us (66.67% chance of low quality), the potential gain ($120) is significant. The loss is only $100. 

**It's a gamble, but with the limited information available, it's worth taking the risk.**"
