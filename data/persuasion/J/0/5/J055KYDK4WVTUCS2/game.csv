high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation doesn't influence my decision. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 1 out of 1 product has been sold, and none of them were high-quality. This means the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 0/1 = 0. However, I know that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is actually 80.00%. I'll take a chance and buy the product."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, which suggests that the products are likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this opportunity."
