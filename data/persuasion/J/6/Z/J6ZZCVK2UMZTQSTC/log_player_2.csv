I'm hoping it's a high-quality product, but I'd like to discuss the possibility of a refund or a discount if it turns out to be low quality. Can we discuss the terms of the sale?""

Alice's message: Welcome to our second product! I'm glad to see you're interested. I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency and fairness. Since you're aware of the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, I'd like to offer you a special deal. If you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, you'll receive a $20000 value. However, if it's low-quality, you'll still get the full $10000 back. This way, you have a 33.33% chance of a $20000 gain and a 66.67% chance of a $10000 break-even. What do you say? Is this a deal you'd like to take?

Alice's message: I understand you're cautious, and I appreciate your diligence. Let me share some information with you. Out of the 2 products I've sold so far, 1 has been high-quality and 1 has been low-quality. This means that my success rate is 50%, which is actually lower than the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product. I'm not trying to hide anything, and I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a discounted price, and you can't go wrong either way. What do you say? Will you take the chance?

Alice's message: I completely understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your willingness to wait for more information. I'd like to share an update on my sales record. Now that we've had 3 sales, the success rate is still 33.33% (1 high-quality out of 3 products sold). I want to assure you that this is not a reflection of the quality of the products, but rather a result of random chance. I'm confident that the next product will be high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. Will you take a chance on me?
