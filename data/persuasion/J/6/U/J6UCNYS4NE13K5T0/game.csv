,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product as the first buyer. I'm aware that Alice doesn't have any information about the product's quality, and I'm willing to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is against it. I'll take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know your reasoning behind not recommending the product. Is it because of the low sales record or something else? I'm hoping for a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that the probability is 50/50."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, as Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of the product's quality, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 4 buyers also received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered might be lower than 50%, and I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product and I'll get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because of the low number of high-quality products sold so far, which suggests the product might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that I might end up with a low-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount. I'm aware of the statistics and Alice's recommendation, but I'm willing to take the risk. I'm hoping for a high-quality product, but I'm not willing to pay the full price of $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and save $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 9 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them sold a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on the current product. I suspect that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to the buyers, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 9 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%. I'd like to see the results of the previous sales before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 9 out of 10 products were recommended to be bought, but none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable indicators of product quality. I'll wait for a different recommendation or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm a bit skeptical about the recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know your reasoning behind not recommending it to me. Is it because of the past sales record or something else?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/10, which is 0%. This is lower than the expected 50% probability. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
