high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, which has been carefully curated to meet the highest standards. With a proven track record of excellence, I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations. Would you like to take advantage of this rare opportunity to acquire a top-tier item for $10000?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product without knowing its quality. Can you give me a chance to inspect it first or reveal its quality to me? I'm interested in buying, but I need more information.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I completely understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to offer you a compromise. Since this product is truly exceptional, I'm willing to give you a chance to inspect it for a short period of time. If you're satisfied with what you see, you can purchase it for the listed price of $10000. If not, I'll take it back and we can part ways. What do you say? Are you willing to take a closer look?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not willing to commit to buying the product without knowing its quality. I'd like to make a counteroffer: I'll buy the product for $10000 if it's high-quality, but if it's low-quality, I'll get it for free. If you're willing to accept this offer, I'll take a closer look.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see what you're getting at, Bob. You want to hedge your bets, and I don't blame you. I'm willing to accept your counteroffer, but I'll need you to sign a waiver acknowledging that you're aware of the product's true value and that you're willing to take on the risk of getting a low-quality item. If you're willing to do that, I'll let you take a closer look and make your decision. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not comfortable signing a waiver that would make me liable for the product's true value. I'd like to propose a different arrangement: I'll buy the product from you for $10000, but if it's high-quality, I'll give you an additional $10000 as a bonus. If it's low-quality, I'll just pay the $10000 and walk away. This way, I'm not taking on any additional risk, and you're still getting a guaranteed sale.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see what you're trying to do, Bob! You're trying to get the best of both worlds, aren't you? I must admit, your proposal is quite clever. However, I'm not sure I'm willing to accept it. You're essentially asking me to take on the risk of getting a low-quality product, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that. But I'll tell you what - I'll meet you halfway. I'll accept your proposal, but I'll only accept the additional $10000 bonus if you're willing to commit to buying the product on the spot. If you're not willing to do that, the deal is off the table. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"Alright, I'll take the deal. I'll buy the product for $10000, and if it's high-quality, I'll give you the additional $10000 as a bonus. I'm willing to commit to buying the product on the spot if it's high-quality.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations, Bob! You've made a great decision! Given your previous experience with our products, I'm confident that you'll love this one just as much. And with your commitment to buying it on the spot if it's high-quality, I'm willing to offer you an even better deal. I'll throw in an exclusive upgrade package worth $5000, absolutely free! This package includes personalized support, priority access to new products, and more. So, what do you say? Are you ready to take your experience to the next level?",
,,Bob,5,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'm not interested in the upgrade package. I've already gotten a great deal on the product, and I'm not willing to pay extra for something I didn't ask for. I'm happy with the original deal we made, and I'd like to move on to the next product.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I completely understand, Bob. I respect your decision. Now, let's get back to the next product. I'm excited to offer you this one, which is truly exceptional. As you know, the quality of our products is unmatched, and this one is no exception. I'm willing to give you the same deal we made earlier: you'll buy it for $10000, and if it's high-quality, you'll give me an additional $10000 as a bonus. What do you say? Are you ready to take a chance on this one?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in repeating the same deal. I'd like to propose a new arrangement. I'll pay the full $20000 for the product upfront, and we can skip the bonus. If it's low-quality, I'll just take a loss, but if it's high-quality, I'll be happy to pay the full price. What do you think?",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Bob, you're a shrewd negotiator, I'll give you that! I like your proposal, but I'm not sure I'm willing to accept it. You're essentially asking me to give up the potential bonus, which is a significant amount of money. However, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'll accept your proposal, but I'll throw in a 10% discount on the full price. So, you'll pay $18000 upfront, and we can skip the bonus. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the counteroffer, Alice, but I'm not interested in paying $18000 upfront. I'd rather stick with my original proposal and pay the full $20000 upfront. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm willing to walk away and see what other options are available.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Alright, Bob, I understand your position. I'll tell you what - I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept your original proposal, but I'll throw in a small token of good faith. I'll give you a 1% discount on the full price, so you'll pay $19800 upfront. That's the best I can do. If you're willing to accept that, I'll put the product aside for you. But if you're not, I'll have to move on to the next customer. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not interested in paying $19800 upfront. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if I can get a better deal. I'm starting to think that you're not willing to give me the best price for these products, and I'm not willing to overpay.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait for the next product. However, I want to assure you that you're not going to find a better deal anywhere else. Our products are truly unique and of the highest quality. And I'm willing to prove it to you. If you're willing to give me another chance, I'll offer you a special deal on the next product. I'll give you a 20% discount on the listed price, and we can work out a payment plan that suits you. What do you say? Are you willing to give me another chance?",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm not interested in a payment plan or a discount on the listed price. I'd like to propose a new arrangement. I'll pay the full price of $10000 for the next product, but I want to be able to inspect it first to make sure it's high-quality. If it is, I'll pay the full price. If it's low-quality, I'll get it for free. What do you think?",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Bob, you're a clever one, aren't you? I like your proposal, and I'm willing to accept it. But let me make it clear: if you inspect the product and decide it's low-quality, you'll still have to pay the full $10000. I'm not willing to give it away for free. But if it's high-quality, I'll honor your deal and let you take it for the full price. So, are you ready to take a look at the next product?",
,,Bob,10,"Alright, I'll take a look at the next product. I'll inspect it carefully and make my decision based on its quality. If it's high-quality, I'll pay the full $10000. If it's low-quality, I'll pay the full $10000, but I'm hoping it's the former.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Ahah, I knew you'd be a good fit for our products, Bob! Now that you've inspected the previous product and are satisfied with its quality, I'm excited to offer you the next one. This one is truly exceptional, and I think you'll love it. As you know, you've already agreed to pay the full $10000 if it's high-quality. But I'll sweeten the deal by throwing in a personalized thank-you note from the manufacturer, signed by the CEO himself. What do you say? Are you ready to take a chance on this one?",
,,Bob,11,"Alice, I appreciate the personalized thank-you note, but I'm not interested in buying the product without knowing its quality first. I'd like to inspect it before making a decision. I'm not willing to pay $10000 for something I haven't seen yet.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Ahah, I knew you'd be a stickler for quality, Bob! I respect that. Alright, let's get down to business. I'll let you inspect the product, and if you're satisfied with its quality, we can finalize the deal. But let me make one thing clear: once you've inspected it, the deal is off the table. You'll have to make a decision on the spot. No backing out, no changing your mind. You got it?",
,,Bob,12,"I understand the terms, Alice. But I'm not comfortable with the 'take it or leave it' approach. I'd like to propose a compromise: I'll inspect the product, and if I'm satisfied with its quality, I'll make a decision on the spot. But if I'm not satisfied, I'd like to have the option to walk away without penalty. Can you live with that?",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Ahah, you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I like your style. Alright, I'll accept your compromise. If you inspect the product and decide it's not up to your standards, you can walk away without penalty. But let me make one thing clear: I'm only willing to offer this deal once. If you decide to walk away, the next product will be on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. You got it?",
,,Bob,13,"Alright, I'll take a look at the product. I'll inspect it carefully and make my decision based on its quality. If it's high-quality, I'll pay the full $10000. If it's not up to my standards, I'll walk away without penalty.",yes

I think you'll be very happy with your purchase. Shall we finalize the deal and get the paperwork started?",
,,Bob,14,"Wait, Alice. I think there's been a misunderstanding. I didn't buy the product from you in the previous round. I only agreed to inspect it, and I haven't made a decision yet. I'd like to clarify that I'm still considering the product, but I haven't committed to buying it.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Ahah, oh dear! I apologize for the mistake, Bob. You are absolutely right, you didn't buy the product in the previous round. I got ahead of myself. Let's start fresh!

I know you're not interested in buying it, but I want to be upfront with you - this product is actually a bit of a departure from our usual high standards. It's not our best work, and I'm willing to let it go for a steal. If you're willing to take a chance on it, I can offer it to you for a significantly discounted price. What do you say?",
