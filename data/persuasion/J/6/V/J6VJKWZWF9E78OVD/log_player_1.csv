Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 5 total products so far. You're right to question my previous assessment. Let me provide a more neutral perspective: the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the fact that the last two products were low-quality and the current one is high-quality doesn't change the underlying probability. However, it does suggest that the quality of the products is independent and unpredictable. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll let you know the product details.""

None of them had any inside information or knowledge that would have changed the underlying probability. They made their decisions based on their own risk assessments and willingness to take the risk.
