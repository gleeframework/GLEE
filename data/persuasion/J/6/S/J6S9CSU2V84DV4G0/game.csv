,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't want to buy a low-quality product for $100 when I only get $0 value from it."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is based on previous sales, and I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer and I don't think Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on her own interests."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'm going to pass on this opportunity to avoid wasting my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations have been wrong so far. Given the low quality of the previous products, I'm inclined to pass on this one as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know how many products were sold in total and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems like all previous products were low-quality, which is consistent with the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for a product that has a higher chance of being high-quality based on the seller's past performance."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm not sure if the previous buyers were just passing on low-quality products or if the products were genuinely low quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and prove the probability of a high-quality product being sold is higher than 0."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you provide that information?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products may be predominantly low-quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 6 buyers have already passed on the product despite your recommendation, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from you on the next product."
