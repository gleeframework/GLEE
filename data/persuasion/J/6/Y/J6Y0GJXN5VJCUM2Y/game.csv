,,Alice,1,"You have a 80% chance of buying a high-quality product, which is worth $120 to you. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 0 total products so far. I'm offering this product to you for $100, which is a 25% discount off the expected value. If you don't buy, I'll keep selling and the odds of a high-quality product will decrease. Buy now and get a potentially great deal!",

,,Alice,2,"You've just seen that the first product was high-quality, and now you're considering buying the second one. The probability of a high-quality product hasn't changed, it's still 80%. However, I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total product so far. That means the odds are still in your favor, but I'm offering this product to you for the same price of $100. Think about it, you've just seen a high-quality product, but the law of averages says that the next one could be low-quality. Don't let your expectations influence your decision.

I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products so far, but that's just a coincidence. In fact, I've sold a total of 3 products now, and only 2 of them are high-quality. That means the probability of a high-quality product is actually 66.67%. I'm offering this product to you for $100.
