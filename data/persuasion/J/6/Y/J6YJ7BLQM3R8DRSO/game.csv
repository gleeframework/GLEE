high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! I have another high-quality product that I think you'll really like. I've already sold one to you, so you know the quality is guaranteed. This one is a different model, but it has the same features and performance. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great value considering its worth is $125. What do you say?",

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're happy with the products! However, I want to be upfront with you - this next product is a bit of a departure from the first two. I've had some issues with it, and I'm not as confident in its quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I want to make it clear that it's a risk. If you're looking to take a chance on a product that might not meet your expectations, this could be a good opportunity. But if you're looking for a guarantee, you might want to pass.",

,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your decision last time, and I respect your preference for high-quality products.

I'm willing to sell it to you for $80, which is a significant discount from the original price. It's not a product I would normally recommend, but it might be useful for someone who needs a spare or a backup. Would you be interested in taking a look?",

I'm not offering any warranty or maintenance package with this product. If you're looking for a low-cost option, this might be a good choice, but if you're looking for a reliable product, you might want to pass.",
