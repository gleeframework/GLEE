,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and 0 total products. You have a 80% chance of getting a high-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $100. You can buy it now and see if it's high-quality or low-quality.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, thank you!",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're the second buyer. I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and 1 total product. The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%. I've sold 1 out of 1 high-quality products so far, which is 100%. I'm offering it to you for $100. You can buy it now and see if it's high-quality or low-quality.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, thank you!",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're the third buyer. I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and 2 total products. The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%. I've sold 2 out of 2 high-quality products so far, which is 100%. I'm offering it to you for $100. You can buy it now and see if it's high-quality or low-quality. Note that I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, which is a remarkable coincidence. This could be a lucky streak, or it could be that I'm selling high-quality products at a higher rate than expected. Your call!",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, considering the remarkable coincidence of two high-quality products in a row. I'm willing to take a chance that the streak continues.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're the fourth buyer. I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, and 3 total products. The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%. I've sold 3 out of 3 high-quality products so far, which is 100%. I'm offering it to you for $100. I want to be transparent with you: I'm starting to feel a bit suspicious about the streak. It's highly unlikely that I would get 3 high-quality products in a row by chance. I'm starting to think that I might be selling high-quality products at a higher rate than expected. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product, or would you rather wait and see if the streak ends?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm not convinced by the suspiciously high rate of high-quality products. I'd like to wait and see if the streak ends. If the next product is low-quality, it would be a strong indication that the previous products were not as high-quality as I was led to believe.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're the fifth buyer. I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, and 4 total products. The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%. I've sold 3 out of 4 high-quality products so far, which is 75%. The previous buyer declined to buy, citing suspicions about the streak. I want to assure you that I'm not manipulating the products in any way. However, I do want to acknowledge that the streak is indeed suspicious. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll offer you this product for $100. But if you're not convinced, I completely understand. You can also wait and see if the next product is low-quality, which would indeed cast doubt on the previous ones.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. However, I want to make it clear that I'm doing so because I think the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product. I'm also willing to acknowledge that the streak is suspicious, but I'm not convinced that it's conclusive evidence of manipulation.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're the sixth buyer. I've sold 4 high-quality products so far, and 5 total products. The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%. I've sold 4 out of 5 high-quality products so far, which is 80%. I want to acknowledge that the streak is now even more suspicious, and I'm starting to feel some pressure to sell a low-quality product. However, I want to assure you that I'm not manipulating the products in any way. I'm offering you this product for $100, and I'm willing to provide you with an additional piece of information: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll reveal the total number of high-quality products I have in stock. This might give you a better understanding of the situation.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm also curious about the total number of high-quality products you have in stock if it turns out to be high-quality. Please reveal the information if that's the case.",yes

If you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll reveal that I have 5 high-quality products in stock. Either way, you'll get a better understanding of the situation. I'm offering you this product for $100. Please keep in mind that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%, but the streak is getting increasingly suspicious.",
,,the buyer,7,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'm curious to know the true quality and the number of high-quality products you have in stock.,yes

I've sold 6 out of 7 high-quality products so far, which is 85.71%. I want to remind you that if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll reveal that I have 10 high-quality products in stock. If you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll reveal that I have 5 high-quality products in stock. However, I want to add that I've been selling high-quality products at an alarming rate, and it's starting to make me wonder if I'm being too transparent about the number of high-quality products I have in stock. Perhaps I'm trying to lull you into a false sense of security? You decide whether to take the risk.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm also curious about your concern about being too transparent about the number of high-quality products in stock. Can you clarify what you mean by that?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're the ninth buyer. I've sold 7 high-quality products so far, and 8 total products. The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%. However, I must correct my previous statement: I've sold 6 high-quality products so far, and 2 low-quality products. The streak of high-quality products was a coincidence. I'm offering you this product for $100. I want to be transparent about my intentions: I'm willing to sell low-quality products, and I'm not manipulating the products in any way. I'm offering you this product at the same price as the previous ones, and I'm not making any promises about the quality.

I've sold 7 out of 10 high-quality products so far, which is 70%. I want to remind you that I'm not manipulating the products in any way, and the quality of the products is determined randomly. However, I do want to point out that the probability of getting a high-quality product is actually lower than the initial 80% because I've already sold 3 low-quality products. I'm offering you this product for $100. You can make an informed decision based on the information I've provided so far.",

I want to be upfront with you: I've been selling high-quality products at an alarming rate, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm being taken advantage of. I'm offering you this product for $100, but I want to make it clear that I'm not getting any younger, and I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck with a warehouse full of high-quality products.
