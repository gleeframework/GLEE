,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the low success rate of previous buyers and Alice's neutral recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. Given Alice's recommendation against buying, I'm going to pass on this product."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous sales record, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it and 2 out of 2 previous buyers also didn't buy, it seems like the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous 2 buyers also purchased and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 2 failed high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 0. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high given the lack of sales and Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is significantly lower than the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product. This suggests that the products sold so far may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I would like to pass on this product."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given your previous recommendations haven't been accurate. I'd like to know more about the overall quality distribution in the previous sales before making a decision."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I'm basing my decision on the statistics, which suggest that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 4 previous buyers who purchased, all of whom received low-quality products, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is higher than 33.33%. I'll wait for a future opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
