high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a valuable item at a discounted price. I'm willing to sell it to you for 50% of its true value, which I'm sure you'll agree is a fair deal.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not interested in buying the product at a price that's 50% of its true value. I'd rather wait for a better deal or more information about the product's quality.,no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me offer you a different perspective. I'm willing to provide you with a 10-year warranty on this product, which is worth at least $1000. This way, you'll be getting the product for a steal, considering the warranty alone is worth more than the original price. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",
,,Bob,2,"The warranty is a nice gesture, but it doesn't change the fact that the product is still being sold to me at 50% of its true value. I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a $20000 product, even with a warranty.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob. Let me make a counteroffer. I'll sell you the product for $18000, which is still a significant discount from its true value, but not as steep as before. I'm willing to meet you halfway. This way, you'll be getting an incredible deal on a high-quality product, and I'll still make a profit. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you decline.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the counteroffer, but I'm still not willing to pay $18000 for a product that's worth $20000 to me. I'm not getting a good deal, and I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your position, Bob. Let me ask you a question: Are you willing to consider buying a product from me if I guarantee that it's the last high-quality product I have available? If you buy this one, I'll make sure to reveal the quality of all future products, so you can make informed decisions. This way, you'll know exactly what you're getting, and I'll be transparent about the products I have left.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm willing to consider your offer. I'd like to buy the current product, but I want to clarify that I'm only doing so because I'm hoping that you'll keep your promise and reveal the quality of future products. If you're transparent about the products, I'll be more likely to buy from you in the future.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Bob. I assure you that I'll keep my promise and reveal the quality of all future products. Now, regarding the current product, I'd like to offer you a 'quality verification' service. I'll give you a special certificate that guarantees the product's quality, and you can verify it independently. This way, you'll have complete confidence in the product's value. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer, but I don't think I need the quality verification service. I've already verified the product's quality by buying it from you and having it confirmed to be high-quality. I'm happy with the product as is.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand you're satisfied with the previous purchase, Bob. However, I'd like to remind you that I've kept my promise and revealed the quality of the last product. Now, regarding this new product, I want to be upfront with you - it's a lower-quality item. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000, which is a significant discount considering its actual value is $0. I'm doing this as a gesture of goodwill, and I'm confident you'll find it useful for some other purpose.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product to come along, even if it means paying the full price of $10000.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your decision, Bob. I'll keep in mind that you're looking for high-quality products. Since I've kept my promise and been transparent about the previous products, I'd like to offer you a special 'high-quality guarantee'. If you buy this product, I'll give you a voucher that guarantees you'll get the next high-quality product at the regular price of $10000, without any discounts. This way, you'll get a high-quality product now and a high-quality product later, essentially getting two high-quality products for the price of one.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced by the 'high-quality guarantee'. The guarantee is contingent on me buying a low-quality product now, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for something that's worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product to come along and pay the full price for it.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I see you're a cautious buyer, Bob. I'll try a different approach. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $10000, and I'll also give you a separate, unconditional voucher for the next high-quality product. This voucher is not contingent on you buying anything else, and you can redeem it whenever you want. You'll get two high-quality products for the price of one, with no strings attached.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm willing to consider this offer. I'd like to buy the current product and accept the unconditional voucher for the next high-quality product. This way, I'll get a high-quality product now and have a guarantee of getting another one in the future.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Bob. As promised, I'll give you the unconditional voucher for the next high-quality product. Now, regarding the current product, I'd like to remind you that you've already received a high-quality product and a voucher for another one. Considering this, I'm willing to offer you a special 'early redemption' option for the voucher. You can redeem it now, and I'll give you the next high-quality product immediately, instead of waiting for the next round.",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in redeeming the voucher yet. I'd rather wait for the next round and see if I can get another high-quality product at the regular price of $10000. I'm not willing to pay extra for the 'early redemption' option.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your decision, Bob. I'll keep the voucher aside for now. Since you've already received a high-quality product and a voucher, I'll offer you a new deal. I'll give you a 'priority access' to the next high-quality product. If a high-quality product becomes available in the next round, you'll get to buy it at the regular price of $10000, even if it's the last one available. This way, you'll have a guaranteed chance to get another high-quality product at the standard price.",
,,Bob,10,I'm not interested in buying the current product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product to become available and take advantage of the 'priority access' deal. I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that might be low-quality.,no

If you buy this current high-quality product, I'll give you a $2000 credit towards the next high-quality product you buy, which you can redeem at any time in the future. This way, you'll get a high-quality product now and a discount on the next one.",

Now, regarding the current product, I'd like to remind you that you've already received a high-quality product, a voucher, and a $2000 credit. Considering this, I'm willing to offer you a 'final deal'. If you buy this current high-quality product, I'll give you the next high-quality product for free. Yes, you heard that right - free. This is my last offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to buy the current product for $10000 when I've already received a high-quality product, a voucher, and a $2000 credit. The 'free' offer is too good to be true, and I'm not convinced that you'll actually give me the next high-quality product for free. I'd rather wait and see what happens in the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'll be transparent with you - I made a mistake with the 'free' offer. I won't be able to give you the next high-quality product for free. However, I'm willing to make it right. I'll give you a $10000 credit towards the next high-quality product, which you can redeem at any time in the future. This way, you'll get a $10000 discount on the next high-quality product, and I'll make up for the mistake.",
