high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average.
