It's not going to change your life or make you feel like a million bucks. But, it's still a great deal at $100!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in practicing my negotiation skills on a product that might not be worth it to me. I'd rather wait for a product that I can buy at a price that reflects its actual value to me.""}"

Are you willing to take a chance on this product?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that a conversation starter is worth $100 to me, especially if it's a low-quality product. I'd like to see more evidence that this product will actually deliver on its promise.""}"
