I'm also considering the updated statistics: 2 high-quality products out of 12 sold, which is a 16.67% success rate.

However, if we consider all 13 products, the overall success rate for high-quality products is still around 38.46% (5 high-quality out of 13), which is closer to the initial 33.33% chance.
