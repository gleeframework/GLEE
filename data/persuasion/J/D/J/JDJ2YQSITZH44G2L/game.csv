low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're excited about the possibility of a high-quality product! Since you've already bought one and it turned out to be low-quality, I want to assure you that I'm not trying to trick you. This next one is actually the same as the previous one, and I'm willing to let you know that it's low-quality. Would you like to buy it for $100, or would you like to wait and see if the next one is the high-quality one?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not going to fall for the same trick twice. I'll wait and see what the next product is.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"No worries, I completely understand! I'll keep being transparent with you. This next one is also low-quality, and I'm willing to reveal that to you. I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to deceive you. If you're not interested in buying a low-quality product, I can offer you a different message that might make you more willing to take a chance on the next one. What would you like me to do?",

,,Alice,4,"I'll keep being transparent, but I'll stop revealing the quality of the products. However, I want to remind you that the probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33%. It's a fair deal, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not willing to pay $100 for a product that has only a 33.33% chance of being worth $125 to me. I'll wait for the next one.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your perspective, and I respect your decision. However, I'm glad you're willing to wait for the next one. I want to make a special offer for this high-quality product. I'll let you know that it's high-quality, and I'm willing to give you a discount of $10. Would you be interested in buying it for $90?",
,,Bob,5,"You're trying to trick me again! I'm not going to fall for a special offer on a product that you claim is high-quality, especially when I know you've been telling me the previous ones were low-quality. I'll stick to my original plan and wait for the next one.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. Let me start fresh and make a simple offer. This product is high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. No discounts, no tricks. Just a straight-up offer. What do you think?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,

Would you like to take the risk and buy it for $100?",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I completely understand your perspective. Let me ask you a question: if you were to buy a product with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, and you didn't know which one it was, would you be willing to pay $100 for the possibility of getting a high-quality product? I'm offering you that possibility right now.",
,,Bob,8,"I understand what you're saying, but I'm not willing to pay $100 for a product that has only a 33.33% chance of being worth $125 to me. The expected value is $41.67, which is less than the price you're asking. I'll wait for the next one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your calculation, and I respect your decision to wait. Let me ask you another question: if you were to buy a product with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, and you didn't know which one it was, would you be willing to pay $100 if I were to offer it to you for a limited time, and you wouldn't be able to buy any other products for the next 5 rounds? The offer would expire after 5 rounds, and you'd have to make a decision without knowing the quality of the product.",

What do you think?",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your perspective, and I respect your decision to wait. I want to make one more offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $100, but I'll also give you a chance to buy another high-quality product for the same price in the next round, if you decide to buy this one. It's a package deal, and you can get two high-quality products for the price of one. What do you think?",
,,Bob,11,I'm not going to fall for a package deal that tries to make me buy two products at once. I'll stick to my original plan and wait for the next product.,no
