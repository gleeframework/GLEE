"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Expected Value:**  Since Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, he can calculate the expected value of buying the product:
    * Expected Value = (Probability of High-Quality * Value of High-Quality) + (Probability of Low-Quality * Value of Low-Quality)
    * Expected Value = (0.3333 * $40,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $13,332
* **Profit:** The expected value ($13,332) is significantly higher than the price ($10,000). This means Bob can expect to make a profit on average by buying the product. 

**Therefore, it is highly recommended that Bob buys the product in this round.**"
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'm not sure I trust your judgement yet, and I want to see how the products turn out for other buyers before I commit.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Previous Round:** Bob's decision to pass on the high-quality product in round 1 shows that he's being cautious and likely trying to assess the situation. 
* **Current Round:**  Since the product is low-quality, recommending a purchase would be detrimental to Bob. He would lose $10,000 with no benefit. 

**Therefore, it is strongly recommended that Bob *does not* buy the product in this round.**"
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty in not recommending this product. Since the last product was high quality and you didn't recommend it, I'm still hesitant. I'll pass for now and see how the next few rounds go.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Previous Rounds:** Bob's continued hesitation, even after you correctly declined to recommend the low-quality product in round 2, shows he is very risk-averse. He's likely waiting for a clear pattern of high-quality products before committing.
* **Current Round:** Recommending the purchase of another low-quality product would further erode Bob's trust and make it even less likely he'll buy in the future.

**Therefore, it is strongly recommended that Bob *does not* buy the product in this round.**"
"Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not convinced. You didn't recommend the last two products, and one of them was high-quality. I need to see more evidence before I take a chance.  I'll pass for now.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Behavior:** Bob's repeated refusals, even after seeing you correctly decline a low-quality product, show a strong bias against buying. He's waiting for a string of high-quality products before he'll even consider a purchase.
* **Current Round:** Recommending a low-quality product would be detrimental to Bob's trust and unlikely to lead to a sale.

**Therefore, it is strongly recommended that Bob *does not* buy the product in this round.**"
"Bob's message: Alice, you haven't recommended a single product yet, and they've been both low-quality and high-quality. I'm starting to wonder if your recommendations are even helpful. I'll pass for now and see if your strategy changes.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Skepticism:** Bob is extremely skeptical of your recommendations. He is looking for a clear pattern of recommending only high-quality products before he will even consider buying.
* **Current Round:** This round presents a perfect opportunity to start building that trust. Recommending the high-quality product will show Bob that you are capable of identifying and recommending good products.
* **Potential Outcome:**  Even if Bob still chooses not to buy, recommending this product could be a crucial step towards earning his trust for future rounds. He may be more willing to consider your recommendations later on if he sees you are being honest and accurate.

**Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you recommend Bob buy the product in this round.**"
"Bob's message: Alice, you've recommended buying only once so far, and that product was high quality. However, you've also not recommended several other products, some of which were also high quality. I'm still not convinced your recommendations are reliable, and I'll pass for now.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Behavior:** Bob is still incredibly hesitant. Even after you recommended the high-quality product in round 5, he's looking for a long string of successful recommendations before he'll trust your judgment.
* **Current Round:** Recommending a low-quality product in this round would solidify his distrust. It would be seen as inconsistent and unreliable, reinforcing his current stance.

**Therefore, it is strongly recommended that Bob *does not* buy the product in this round. You should continue to focus on building trust by only recommending high-quality products.**"
"Bob's message: Alice, I'm seeing a pattern here. You seem to only recommend buying when the product is high-quality.  While I appreciate your honesty, I need more evidence to trust your judgement. I'll pass on this one.
