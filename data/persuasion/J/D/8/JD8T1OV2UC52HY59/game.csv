,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just make an uninformed decision"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'm not sure if I should trust Alice's recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer's decision and the product they received?
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product. Please reveal its quality.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 buyer purchasing the product and no high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd rather wait and see if the next buyer purchases it, which would give me more information about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience. Did they buy a low-quality product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than the probability of it being low quality, based on the fact that you didn't recommend it. I'm not relying on your recommendation, but rather on the fact that you wouldn't recommend it if it was low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not buying. Given the previous sales record, I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying the product, I'll pass on it. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the products being sold so far are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that all products sold so far have been low-quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is higher than the initial 50%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, none of the previous buyers were able to get a high-quality product, and I'm skeptical about the quality of this one. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping for a high-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that all 5 previous buyers passed on the products after your recommendations, I'm going to pass on this one too. I think there might be a pattern here..."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation. I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 50% and I'm willing to take that chance.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have purchased the product before me and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'm concerned that the probability of getting a high-quality product is less than 50% and would like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm starting to suspect that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice has recommended it and I'm concerned it might be low quality given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
