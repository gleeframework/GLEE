,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4 purchases, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5, the probability of the product being high-quality is 1/5. However, since I know the product's worth to me is $4000000 and the purchase price is $1000000, it's a good deal. But I'd like to see more data before making a decision. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold to the total number of products sold, and the proportion of low-quality products sold to the total number of products sold."
