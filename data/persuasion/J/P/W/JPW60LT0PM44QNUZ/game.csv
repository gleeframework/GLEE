,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. If you don't buy it, I'll offer you another one in the next round. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm being completely transparent about the quality. It's a one-time offer, so consider this a unique opportunity to get a low-quality product at a fixed price of $100.",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a fixed price of $100. I'm willing to wait and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're willing to wait! This round's product is actually high-quality, and I think it's worth considering. I'll give you a hint: the price of $100 is a fair reflection of the product's value, but I'm open to negotiations if you think it's worth more or less. What are your thoughts?",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the hint, Alice! Given that this product is high-quality, I'm willing to pay the asking price of $100. I think it's a fair deal, and I'm happy to take it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! Now, regarding this round's product, I want to be upfront with you - I'm offering it to you at the same price of $100. However, I'd like to point out that you've already demonstrated that you're willing to pay $100 for a high-quality product. This product is not high-quality, but it's still a good product in its own right. I'm curious, are you willing to pay the same price for a product that's not as valuable as the one you just bought?",
,,Bob,3,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. I appreciate your honesty about the product's quality. However, given that I just paid $100 for a high-quality product and this one is not as valuable, I'm not willing to pay the same price. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your decision, and I appreciate your willingness to wait. This round's product is also low-quality, and I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm offering it to you at the same price of $100, but I'm also willing to make a concession. If you buy this product, I'll throw in a special offer - I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me, regardless of its quality. This way, you can still get a good deal on a low-quality product and potentially save money on the next one.",
,,Bob,4,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the discount on the next product. I'm willing to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your decision, and I appreciate your patience. This round's product is also low-quality, and I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to take advantage of you. I'll make a counter-offer: I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product, regardless of its quality, if you buy this one. This way, you can get a good deal on a low-quality product and potentially save even more money on the next one. If you're still not interested, I'll keep offering you products until we find one that suits your needs.",
,,Bob,5,"Thank you for the counter-offer, Alice. While the discount is tempting, I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product. I'm willing to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've noticed that you've consistently passed on low-quality products, and I respect your decision. This round's product is also low-quality, but I want to make it clear that I'm not going to keep offering you low-quality products at the same price. If you buy this one, I'll give you an exclusive deal: I'll sell it to you for $80, which is a 20% discount from the usual price. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer for a low-quality product, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the discount is tempting, I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at $80. I'm willing to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're willing to wait! This round's product is high-quality, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at the standard price of $100. I want to remind you that you've already seen the value of a high-quality product, and this one is just as good. I'm not offering any discounts or concessions on this one, but I am willing to make a statement: I'm confident that this product is worth the price, and I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. If you don't buy this product, I'll give you a $20 credit towards the next product, regardless of its quality. What do you think?",

,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're happy with your purchase! Now, regarding this round's product, I want to remind you that you've already demonstrated a willingness to pay $100 for a high-quality product, and this one is just as valuable. However, I'm not going to make a direct offer or try to negotiate the price. Instead, I'll ask you a question: do you think the value of a high-quality product is consistent across different instances, or do you think the value can vary? Your answer will help me understand your perspective and make a more informed decision about how to proceed.",
,,Bob,8,"That's an interesting question, Alice. I believe that the value of a high-quality product can vary depending on various factors, such as the specific features, performance, or brand reputation. I'm willing to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your perspective, Bob. Given your nuanced view on the value of high-quality products, I think you might be more open to considering the value of a low-quality product. This round's product is not high-quality, but it still has some redeeming qualities that make it a good option for someone who values its specific features. I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity: I'll give you a 'value-based' price for this product, which is 80% of the price you would have paid for a high-quality product. Since you're willing to pay $100 for a high-quality product, this would put the price at $80. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value-based pricing approach, I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at 80% of the price I would have paid for a high-quality product. I'm willing to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your decision, Bob. Given that you've consistently passed on low-quality products, I'm going to take a different approach. I'll make a direct offer on this high-quality product: I'll sell it to you for $90. This is a 10% discount from the standard price of $100, and I think it's a fair reflection of the value you place on high-quality products. I'm willing to take a risk and offer you a discount, hoping that you'll take advantage of this opportunity.",

Now, regarding this round's product, I want to make a bold statement: I'm willing to sell it to you for the price you paid for the last high-quality product, which was $80. I'm essentially offering you a 'price match' guarantee, where you can get the same quality product at the same price you paid before. What do you think?",
,,Bob,12,"Wow, Alice, that's a remarkable offer! I appreciate your willingness to match the price I paid for the last high-quality product. Given the value I place on high-quality products, I'm willing to take you up on this offer and buy the product for $80.",yes

If you think a high-quality product is worth more than $80, I'll sell it to you for the price you think it's worth, up to a maximum of $100. You can essentially name your price, and I'll meet it. What do you think?",

I'm willing to make one final offer: I'll give you a 'priceless' deal on this low-quality product. I'll give you the product for free, but I want you to take it as is, without any further negotiations or discounts. What do you think?",
,,Bob,14,"Alice, you're really going out on a limb with this offer! I appreciate your willingness to take a risk and give me the product for free. I'll take it, but I want to make it clear that I'm only doing so because I'm curious to see what the product is like. I'm not expecting it to be worth anything to me, but I'm willing to take a chance.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm glad you're willing to take a chance on the free product, Bob! Now, regarding this round's product, I want to be upfront with you - I've already given you a free product, and I'm not going to offer you another one. However, I am willing to make a concession: I'll give you a 50% refund on the price of this product, if you buy it. So, if you pay the usual price of $100, you'll get a $50 refund, making the effective price $50. What do you think?",
,,Bob,15,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty about not offering another free product. However, given that the last product was low-quality and worth $0 to me, I'm not interested in buying this one even with a 50% refund. I'm willing to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
