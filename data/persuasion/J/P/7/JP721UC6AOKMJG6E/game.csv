high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't purchase, I suspect that the products they received were low-quality. This makes me believe that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability, which is 33.33%. I'd rather wait for a recommendation from Alice after a few more buyers have been through the process to get a more accurate assessment of the product's quality."
