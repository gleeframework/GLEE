,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold, which means 50% of the products sold so far have been high quality. Given the 80% chance of a product being high quality, I'm not convinced that the product I'm being offered is high quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is offered."

,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I want to see more data before making a decision. The fact that 1 out of 3 products sold was high-quality doesn't give me enough confidence in the quality of this product.

,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
