But I'm telling you, Bob, this is going to be the one. Are you ready to take a chance on me... again?",
,,Bob,6,"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but five low-quality products in a row is a pretty clear pattern. I'm starting to think that the probability of a high-quality product is indeed 33.33% as initially stated, and I'm just waiting for the odds to catch up.
