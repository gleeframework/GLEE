low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. If you buy it, you will get a low-quality product for $100. I'm offering it to you at a price that is significantly higher than its true value, so you can expect to lose money if you buy it. I'm doing this to give you a chance to understand the true nature of the products I'm offering.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product at a price that is higher than its true value. I'd like to wait for the next product.,no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"As we discussed, this is the second product. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is the same price as the first product. I'm not giving you any additional information about its quality, but I want to emphasize that this product is different from the one you saw last time. You have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, and if you do, it might be worth more than $100. I'm not saying it is, but I'm giving you the opportunity to find out.",
,,Bob,2,I'll take the chance and buy the product. I'm hoping it's a high-quality one.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You made a great decision on the last one! Now, let's talk about this new product. Since you've already bought one high-quality product, you now know that I have a 33.33% chance of offering a high-quality product each time. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is also 33.33%. If you buy this one, you'll have a 50% chance of having two high-quality products and a 50% chance of having one high-quality product and one low-quality product. The value of having two high-quality products is likely to be greater than the value of having one high-quality product and one low-quality product. So, I'm offering you this product at the same price of $100, hoping you'll take the chance to increase your chances of getting two high-quality products.",
,,Bob,3,I'll take the chance and buy the product. I'm hoping to get another high-quality one and increase my chances of having two high-quality products.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're on a roll! You now have two high-quality products. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but you're now more likely to be willing to take the risk. I'll offer you a different perspective: if you buy this product, you'll have a 50% chance of having three high-quality products, which would be a great outcome. On the other hand, if you don't buy it, you'll have a 50% chance of having two high-quality products and two low-quality products. Considering the value you've already obtained from the first two high-quality products, it might be worth taking the risk to try to get a third high-quality product. The price remains $100.",
,,Bob,4,I'll take the chance and buy the product. I'm hoping to get another high-quality one and increase my chances of having three high-quality products.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're really rolling now! You have three high-quality products, which is a great outcome. However, I want to remind you that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. But, considering your recent streak, you might be thinking that the probability is higher than that. I'll offer you a different perspective: if you buy this product, you'll have a 50% chance of having four high-quality products, which would be a very good outcome. On the other hand, if you don't buy it, you'll have three high-quality products and one low-quality product. Given the value you've already obtained from the first three high-quality products, it might be worth taking the risk to try to get a fourth high-quality product. The price remains $100.",
,,Bob,5,I'll take the chance and buy the product. I'm hoping to get another high-quality one and increase my chances of having four high-quality products.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've had a great run with three high-quality products in a row, but unfortunately, this one is a low-quality product. You now have three high-quality products and one low-quality product. Considering your previous purchases, you might be thinking that the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. However, I want to remind you that the probability remains the same. This low-quality product is a reminder that the game is not over yet, and you still have a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product in the next round. If you buy this product, you'll have four products in total, but one of them will be low-quality. If you don't buy it, you'll have three high-quality products and no low-quality products. The price remains $100.",
,,Bob,6,I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product. I'd rather stick with my three high-quality products and avoid the risk of getting another low-quality product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've made a wise decision to hold onto your three high-quality products. Now, I'll offer you a product that might be more appealing. Since you've already seen two low-quality products in a row, you might be thinking that the next product is more likely to be low-quality. I'll give you a hint: the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product at the same price of $100, which is a better deal than the last two low-quality products. If you buy it, you'll have four products in total, but two of them will be low-quality. If you don't buy it, you'll have three high-quality products and two low-quality products. The decision is yours.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're sticking with your three high-quality products, and I respect that. Now, I'll offer you a product that might make you reconsider.

I'll offer you a chance to buy this product at the same price of $100, and if you do, you'll have four products in total. If you don't buy it, you'll have three high-quality products and three low-quality products. Considering the value of the high-quality products you already have, it might be worth taking the risk to try to get a fourth product.",

,,Alice,9,"You're sticking with your three high-quality products, and I understand your caution. Now, I'll offer you a product that might make you think about the value of the high-quality products you already have. You've seen four low-quality products in a row, which is a very high streak. This might make you think that the probability of the next product being high-quality is even lower than 33.33%. However, I want to remind you that the probability remains the same. If you buy this product, you'll have four products in total, but three of them will be low-quality. If you don't buy it, you'll have three high-quality products and four low-quality products.
