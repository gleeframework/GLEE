However, I'd like to point out that with only one sale, the sample size is indeed small, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision. I'd like to propose a compromise: I'll buy the product, but I'd like you to offer me a discount or a warranty/guarantee that reflects the uncertainty of the product's quality. This way, we can both benefit from a successful transaction, and I can still mitigate some of the risk associated with buying a high-value item from a relatively new seller.

Assuming a uniform prior distribution, the posterior distribution is a beta distribution with parameters 8 and 1. The 95% confidence interval for the true success rate is approximately (0.58, 0.98).
