Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to provide more context. Out of 4 products sold, 2 are high-quality. In total, we've had 4 potential buyers, and 2 have passed on the product. This means that 50% of buyers who have seen the product have chosen not to buy it, which is a good indication that the product might not be high-quality.

They were looking for more context and reassurance before making a decision. I'm offering this product to you for $100, and I'm confident that you'll make a great decision. The sales record speaks for itself: 3 out of 7 buyers have bought the product, which is a 42.86% chance of getting a high-quality product. It's a risk, but it could be a great opportunity!
