,,Alice,1,"This product is a special deal, worth every penny at $100!",
,,Bob,1,"Thanks for the recommendation, but I'm not sure I trust the 'special deal' claim.  Since I have no way to verify the quality, I'm going to pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,2,"I'm willing to vouch for this one! I've personally inspected it and can assure you that it's a top-notch product. I'm confident you'll love it. Plus, I'll give you a 100% satisfaction guarantee. This is a rare opportunity to get a $400 product for just $100. Don't miss out!",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the offer and the guarantee. While I appreciate your confidence, I'm still hesitant to purchase without more information. Perhaps if you could show me some proof of the product's quality, I would feel more comfortable.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'd like to offer you a compromise. I'll give you a 'certification' that I've attached to the product. It's a small sticker that says 'Quality Guaranteed' on it. It's not a formal certification, but it's a personal assurance from me that this product is one of the good ones. Would you be willing to take a chance on it?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I still feel uncertain. While the sticker might be a small gesture, it doesn't really change the fact that I'm still buying blindly. Perhaps you could offer a more tangible form of assurance, like a partial refund if I'm unsatisfied? If not, I'll have to pass again.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about the refund, Bob. However, I'm a small business owner and can't offer a refund on a product that's already been sold. But I can offer you a unique opportunity to 'test' the product without risking the full $100. If you're not satisfied, I'll give you a'store credit' for $50 towards a future purchase. It's a way for you to try out the product with minimal risk. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, that's a very generous offer. I'm still hesitant, but the $50 store credit definitely makes it more appealing. I'm willing to take a chance on this one. Let's do it.",yes

Plus, since you've already shown your willingness to take a chance on the previous product, I'm willing to offer you an exclusive deal. If you buy this product, I'll throw in a FREE accessory that complements it perfectly. It's a $50 value, absolutely free. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, while the free accessory is tempting, I'm still wary of buying based on customer feedback alone. Could you share any more information about the product's features or benefits?  I'd also like to hear what kind of issues previous customers had, if any.  I'm still recovering from the last purchase, so I need some more convincing before committing to another.",no
