high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to base my decision on. With a 50% chance of the product being low quality and worth $0, I'm not willing to take the risk of losing $100."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to base my decision on. Given that there's a 50% chance of the product being low quality, which would be worth $0 to me, I'm not willing to take the risk at this point."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to rely on. Given that the product has a 50% chance of being either high or low quality and Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any additional information about the product's quality, the expected value of buying the product is $60 (0.5 * $120 + 0.5 * $0), which is less than the price of $100. Therefore, it's not in my best interest to buy."
