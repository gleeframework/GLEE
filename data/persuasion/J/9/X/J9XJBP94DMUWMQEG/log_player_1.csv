Based on the data, I can calculate the probability of a high-quality product being sold. Given that 3 out of 3 products sold so far were low-quality, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 33.33%. This is because each product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, and the previous sales don't affect the probability of the next product being high-quality.

Would you be interested in taking advantage of this offer and potentially owning a high-quality product?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to clarify that the 15% discount is on the original price of $1000000, so the new price would be $850000. I'm considering this offer because I think the potential upside of owning a high-quality product ($1250000) is worth the potential loss of $150000 if the product is low-quality.

Are you willing to take a chance on potentially owning a high-quality product?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% as you claim. Given that 1 out of 4 previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the true probability of a high-quality product is higher.
