,,Alice,1,"This is the first product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it. If you're not sure, I can offer some additional information to help you make a decision.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take a chance on the product and buy it, hoping it's high-quality.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took a chance on the first product! Now that you've bought one, I'll let you in on a little secret: the product you just bought is actually high-quality! I'm offering you another product, and I want to give you a better chance to make an informed decision this time. Would you like to know the probability that this next product is high-quality?",
,,Bob,2,I'd like to know the probability that this next product is high-quality.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"The probability that this product is high-quality is 33.33%, as we discussed earlier. Considering you just bought a high-quality product in the previous round, I'm wondering if you'd like to take a chance on another product. Since you've already taken a risk and it paid off, I'm offering you a 'insurance' message: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a detailed explanation of the product's flaws and what went wrong.",
,,Bob,3,"I'd like to take a chance on the product and buy it, hoping it's high-quality again.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're on a roll! Two high-quality products in a row! However, I'm starting to think that you might be getting a bit lucky. I'm offering you a 'hedging' message: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a refund of $50, which is half of the price. This way, you'll only lose half of your investment if it's not what you're looking for.",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the hedging offer and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality again, and if not, at least I'll get some refund.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're on a hot streak! Three high-quality products in a row! I'm starting to think you're a high-quality magnet! However, I want to make sure you're aware that the law of averages is going to catch up to you eventually. I'm offering you a'reality check' message: the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and you've just experienced a streak of bad luck is unlikely. Would you like to take a chance on this next product and see if you can keep the streak going?",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take a chance on the product and buy it, hoping to continue the streak, but also acknowledging the reality check and the probability of the product being low-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"The streak is over! You were due for a reality check. I'm offering you a'recalibration' message: considering you've just experienced a low-quality product after a streak of high-quality ones, I'm willing to give you a better deal. I'll offer you a 20% discount on the next product, if you're willing to take a chance on it. This way, you'll only pay $80 for the next product, regardless of its quality.",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the recalibration offer and buy the product at the discounted price of $80, hoping it's high-quality again, and also acknowledging the discount as a good deal.",yes

,,Alice,7,"You're back on track! I'm glad you took advantage of the recalibration offer. Now that you've bought another high-quality product, I want to make you an 'insurance policy' offer. Since you've had two consecutive high-quality products after a low-quality one, I'll give you a guarantee: if the next product is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked. Would you like to take a chance on this next product with the added security of a refund guarantee?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"The insurance policy didn't quite cover this one! You're due for another reality check. Considering you just took advantage of the insurance policy and it didn't pay off, I'm offering you a'reset' message: I'll give you a completely new product, and we'll start fresh. No discounts, no guarantees, no nothing. Just a clean slate. Would you like to take a chance on this next product and see if you can turn your luck around?",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take a chance on the new product and start fresh, hoping to turn my luck around and get back on a high-quality streak.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

I'm offering you a 'honesty is the best policy' message: I'll give you a detailed explanation of why this product is low-quality, and what went wrong in the manufacturing process. This way, you'll know exactly what to expect from this product, and you can make a more informed decision about whether to buy it or not.",

high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"No worries, I completely understand! You're being cautious, and that's a smart move. Now that you've seen the behind-the-scenes of what went wrong with the previous product, I'm offering you a 'fresh start' message: I'll give you a brand new product, and I'll tell you upfront that it's high-quality. No need to take a chance, no need to worry about the quality. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity and buy a high-quality product for $100?",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take advantage of the fresh start offer and buy the high-quality product for $100, knowing that it's guaranteed to be high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Déjà vu! You're back to where you started, and I'm back to being honest with you. I'm offering you a'second chance' message: considering you've already taken advantage of the fresh start offer and bought a high-quality product, I'll give you a chance to redeem yourself. I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product, and I'll also throw in a 'product upgrade' - if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a free upgrade to a high-quality product of your choice from a future round.",

I'll tell you that this product is a'sister product' of the one you just bought, and it's just as high-quality. Would you like to take a chance on this similar product for $100?",

,,Alice,13,"You're on a roll! Two high-quality sister products in a row! I'm offering you a 'pattern recognition' message: considering you've bought two high-quality products that are similar, I think you might be able to spot a pattern. I'll give you a chance to buy a product that's from the same product line as the sister products, but with a twist - it's a 'limited edition' version. Would you like to take a chance on this limited edition product for $100?",
,,Bob,13,"I'll take a chance on the limited edition product, hoping it's high-quality as well, and also excited to see how it compares to the sister products.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"The streak is broken! You were due for a reality check. I'm offering you a 'pattern recognition reversal' message: considering you've just bought a low-quality product after a string of high-quality ones, I think you might be due for a change of pace. I'll give you a chance to buy a product that's completely different from the sister products and limited edition product. It's a 'wildcard' product that's not from any specific product line. Would you like to take a chance on this wildcard product for $100?",

I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product, and I'll also throw in a 'guaranteed satisfaction' promise - if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked.

,,Alice,17,"The final offer didn't quite pay off. You're still on a low-quality streak. I'm offering you a 'last resort' message: considering you've taken advantage of every offer I've given you and still haven't broken the streak, I'm willing to give you a product that's essentially a'mystery box'. I won't tell you anything about it, and you'll have to take a complete chance on it. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll still give you a full refund, just like the guaranteed satisfaction promise. But if it's high-quality, I'll give you a 25% discount on your next purchase. It's a 50/50 chance, and it's your last chance to break the streak. Would you like to take a chance on the mystery box?",

I'll give you a 30% discount on the next product, and I'll also throw in a 'no-questions-asked' refund policy - if you buy this product and it's low-quality, you'll get a full refund, no questions asked, and we can part ways on good terms.

,,Alice,20,"Well, it looks like the streak is back on! You've had a great run, but it looks like you're due for another reality check. Considering you've already taken a 'victory lap' and received a free product, I'm not going to offer you any more deals or discounts.
