"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the value of each product to you, and she recommends buying, it's highly likely she's offering a high-quality product. Although there's still a 20% chance it's low quality, the potential reward of $4,000,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're on a roll! I'll buy this one too.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a proven track record of recommending high-quality products, as she did in the previous round.  While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the odds are in our favor, and the potential reward is significantly higher than the cost."

```

**Reasoning:**

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a perfect track record so far.  Her not recommending this product strongly suggests that it is likely low-quality.
