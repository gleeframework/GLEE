Given the probability of 33.33% for a high-quality product, I'd expect to have sold 2 high-quality products by now if I had only sold high-quality products. The fact that I've only sold 1 suggests that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. This one is high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity?",
