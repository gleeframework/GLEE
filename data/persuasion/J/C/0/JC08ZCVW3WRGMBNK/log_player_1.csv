I understand the temptation to recommend this high-quality product. However, given the current situation, it's better to maintain consistency.  We have no track record of sales, and recommending a purchase now would create suspicion. If we start recommending now, and the buyer discovers the product is high quality, they'll assume we're always truthful. But, when we encounter a low-quality product later, they won't trust us. 

It's better to establish a pattern of being honest even when it's less profitable in the short term.  This will build trust and potentially lead to more sales in the future."
