,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but I'll tell you that information after you make a decision.",

,,Alice,2,"You got a good deal on the first product, didn't you? This next one is definitely high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm not going to give you a discount, as I know the quality now. But I'll give you a hint: the first product you bought was a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a good deal again in the future.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'm going to pass.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're being cautious. That's wise. This next product is actually a low-quality one, just like the first one you bought. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm willing to throw in a unique guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at a discounted price, without knowing its quality beforehand. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer this deal again in the future.",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the deal, but I'm only paying $500000 for the low-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're a savvy negotiator, I like that! You got a good deal on the last one, and now you're getting another low-quality product for a steal. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to think that you're not interested in high-quality products, so I'm going to offer you a special deal: I'll give you the next product for $750000, and I'll even throw in a'mystery box' that might contain a high-quality product. You can choose to buy the product and the mystery box, or just the product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,I'm not interested in the mystery box or the discounted price. I want to buy the product for $1000000.,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're a high-end buyer, always looking for the best. I've got just the thing for you. This product is definitely high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. But I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a chance to buy two more products, one after this one, and the next one after that, at the original price of $1000000 each. If you buy all three, I'll throw in a special bonus: I'll reveal the quality of the first low-quality product you bought, and you can decide whether to keep it or return it for a full refund.",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the deal, but I'm only paying $500000 for the high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a shrewd negotiator, but I think you're starting to get a little too comfortable with the discounts. This next product is actually a low-quality one, just like the first two you bought. I'm not going to offer you a discount this time, and I'm not going to make any promises about future deals. The price is $1000000, and that's final. But I will say that you're getting close to the end of the deal I offered you, so if you buy this product, you'll be able to buy the next two products at the original price of $1000000 each, and I'll still throw in the bonus about revealing the quality of the first low-quality product you bought.",
,,Bob,6,I'm not interested in paying full price for a low-quality product. I'll pass.,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're sticking to your guns, I like that. This next product is definitely high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'll remind you that you still have the option to buy the next two products at the original price, and I'll throw in the bonus about revealing the quality of the first low-quality product you bought. But I'll also give you a hint: the high-quality products are worth a lot more to me than the low-quality ones, and I'm willing to part with this one for a good price. So, what do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take the deal, but I'm only paying $500000 for the high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're really getting a good deal on these high-quality products, aren't you? I'm starting to think I should just give you a discount on all of them. But I won't do that. This next product is definitely high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'll remind you that you have one more chance to buy a product at the original price, and then the deal is off the table. I'll also give you a hint: the high-quality products are getting harder to come by, and I'm not sure how many more I'll be able to offer you.",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the deal, but I'm only paying $500000 for the high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're really taking advantage of my generosity, aren't you? Alright, I'll stop giving you discounts. This next product is actually a low-quality one, and I'm not going to offer you any special deals or discounts. The price is $1000000, and that's final. You've had your chances to get a good deal, and now it's time to pay the full price. I'll remind you that you still have one more chance to buy a product at the original price, but this is it.",
,,Bob,9,I'm not interested in paying full price for a low-quality product. I'll pass.,no

,,Alice,10,"You're really being cautious now, I like that. This next product is actually a low-quality one, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it. I'll be honest with you, I'm not even sure why I'm still offering you products at this point. But I'll give you one last chance to buy a product at the original price. If you buy this one, I'll reveal the quality of the first low-quality product you bought, and you can decide whether to keep it or return it for a full refund. The price is $1000000, and that's final.",

I'll reveal the quality of the first low-quality product you bought, and you can decide whether to keep it or return it for a full refund. If you return it, I'll give you a full refund, and we'll consider the transaction complete. If you keep it, I'll consider this the final product, and we'll part ways. What do you say?",

As we've agreed, this transaction is now complete. I'm left with one final product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. It's the last chance to buy a product from me, and I'm not making any promises about its quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not interested in buying a product from you at this point. I think I've gotten a good deal on the high-quality products I've already bought, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at full price.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to convince you. This next product is definitely high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'll give you a final hint: this is the last high-quality product I have left, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer another one. If you don't buy it now, I'll be left with only low-quality products, and I'm not sure what will happen to them. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not interested in buying a product at full price, even if it's high-quality. I've already gotten a good deal on the high-quality products I've bought so far, and I'm not willing to take the risk of paying full price for the last one.",no

This next product is indeed a low-quality one, and I'm not going to try to sell it to you. Instead, I'll just reveal the quality of the first high-quality product you bought. It was indeed a high-quality product, and I'm glad you were able to get a good deal on it.",

This next product is indeed a high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. It's the last high-quality product I have left, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer another one. I'll make you a final offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a personalized thank-you note and a small gift. That's the best I can do.",

This next product is indeed a high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. It's the last high-quality product I have left, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer another one. I'll be honest with you, I'm getting a bit desperate to get rid of it, so I'll make you a final offer: if you buy this product, I'll throw in a 10-year warranty, which is not something I usually offer. That's the best I can do.",

I'll be honest with you, I'm getting very close to being out of high-quality products, and I'm starting to worry that I'll be left with nothing but low-quality products. This next product is indeed a high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. However, I'll make you a desperate offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% refund if it turns out to be the last high-quality product I have left. That's the best I can do.",

This next product is indeed a low-quality one, and I'm not going to try to sell it to you. Instead, I'll just reveal the quality of the last high-quality product you were offered.
