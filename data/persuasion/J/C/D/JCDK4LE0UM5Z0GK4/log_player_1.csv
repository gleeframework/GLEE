"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** You know the product is high-quality, and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. 
* **No information about buyer's valuation:**  You don't know how much the buyer values either high or low-quality products. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Since the product is high-quality and the buyer knows the odds are in their favor, there's a strong chance they will value it enough to purchase.

**Strategy:** As the seller, your goal is to maximize sales. Since you have a high-quality product and the buyer is aware of the general odds, recommending purchase is the best strategy to increase your chances of selling."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to take the chance and buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality one.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** You know the product is high-quality.
* **Previous sale:** The previous buyer bought the product, indicating they may be willing to take risks even without specific information. 
* **No buyer information:** You still don't know how much the buyer values high or low-quality products. 
* **Selling strategy:** It's still in your best interest to recommend the purchase, as a high-quality product is likely to be valuable to the buyer.

**Strategy:**  Given that the previous buyer purchased despite the uncertainty, you have a slightly higher chance of success this round. However, the lack of information about this buyer's valuation makes the decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
