Alice's message: I see you're a careful thinker! You're absolutely right again, the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 0.5. I respect your decision-making process. Let me offer you a different approach: I'll give you a guarantee. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a $20 discount on your next purchase. That way, you'll get a great deal either way, and I'll get to make a sale!
