**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This is a strong indicator that Alice is accurately identifying and recommending high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product adds further weight to the likelihood of it being high-quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's still a risk of the product being low-quality, the potential reward of $12,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 

**It's important to note:** This strategy is based on the assumption that Alice is acting in a way that benefits both her and the buyers.  If Alice is being dishonest or manipulating the system, this strategy could fail."
