Alice's message: You're considering purchasing a product from a seller with a 50% success rate, and four out of six products being low-quality. The pattern is clear, and it's natural to question the seller's strategy. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. The products are randomly selected, and the 50% success rate is genuine. However, I can't deny that the streak of low-quality products is concerning. If you're willing to take the risk, this product could be a rare high-quality item. But if you're not comfortable with the odds, I understand. You might want to consider asking yourself: what's the potential reward worth the risk, and are you willing to take a chance on a potentially high-quality product?
