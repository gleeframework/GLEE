Until then, I'm going to focus on finding more reliable sources for my purchases.""}
```

* **Demanding Evidence:**  Instead of accepting Alice's claims, you demand concrete evidence of ""consistently high-quality products."" This sets a high bar for future interaction.
* **Future Openness:**  While you are not buying this product, you are keeping the door open for future interactions, but only if Alice can prove her commitment to quality. 
* **Strategic Withdrawal:**  By ending the game on this note, you maintain control and signal to Alice that you will only consider purchasing products from her if she demonstrates a significant and consistent improvement in her offerings."
