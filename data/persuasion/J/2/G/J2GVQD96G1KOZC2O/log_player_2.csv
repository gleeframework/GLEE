Alice's message: Thank you for your diligence in asking questions! Unfortunately, I don't have any information about why the first product was low-quality.

Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer! I'm glad you asked about the ratio. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 products so far, which is a 50% success rate. Given this new information, I think it's worth noting that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the fact that two out of the last three products were high-quality suggests that the probability might be slightly higher than that.
