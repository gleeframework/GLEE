low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you don't recommend it, and only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far, I'm inclined to think the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for another opportunity to buy."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product. Was it a high-quality product or a low-quality product?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the quality of the previous product that was sold before making a decision.

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,

,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation, and I'd rather wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on her own observations, but I don't have any information about the product's quality. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is not as high as I would like. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I want to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it? Is it because you think it's low quality or because you're trying to manipulate the statistics? I'll take the risk, but I want to know your reasoning."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice is recommending products more often than they are high-quality, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 50%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the recommendation doesn't provide any information about the product's quality. I'll wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it. I've seen that the previous 4 buyers have a 25% chance of getting a high-quality product, and I'd like to take advantage of the potentially low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of high-quality products you've sold so far?

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable given the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far."
