,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the chance that it might be a high-quality product."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm trying to beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better recommendation in the future."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still quite low given the previous sales record."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, which suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely based on the product being low-quality. I will also consider the probability of the product being high-quality (33.33%) and the potential gain of $1200000. Given the high risk of buying a low-quality product and the low probability of it being high-quality, I will pass on this product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I think the probability of this product being high-quality is very low, and I don't want to waste $1000000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and all of them were low-quality products, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to wait for a more informative signal before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, it's likely that the products sold so far were low-quality. This suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the initial 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even with your recommendation against it. I'm basing my decision on the fact that there have been 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products have been sold. Given the low probability of a high-quality product (33.33%), I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I think the proportion of high-quality products is likely to be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, and I'm not confident that the product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that you've already had 5 buyers and no high-quality products have been sold. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given your previous recommendations have been wrong so far."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I suspect that Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'll pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer will be more cautious."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
