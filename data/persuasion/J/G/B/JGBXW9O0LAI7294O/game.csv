As you may have noticed, I've sold 5 high-quality products so far, which is a great track record. However, I want to caution you that the law of large numbers is starting to apply. While the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, the chances of getting a low-quality product are increasing. I'm offering you this high-quality product at the same price of $1000000, and I'm confident it's a great investment. But I want to ask, are you willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, or do you want to play it safe with a high-quality product?",

I'm offering it to you at the same price of $1000000, but I want to be transparent about its quality. I've had some customers who have been disappointed with this product, and I don't want you to be one of them. If you're looking for a product that's worth the full price, I'd be happy to offer you a different option.
