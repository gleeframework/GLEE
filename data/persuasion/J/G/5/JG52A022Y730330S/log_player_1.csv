"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

As a rational buyer, it's not logical to buy a product worth $4,000,000 for $1,000,000 when there's a 50% chance it's worth nothing. The potential profit is not worth the risk. 

While the seller claims this round's product is high-quality, there is no way to verify this claim. The buyer has no reason to trust the seller, especially since there's no prior history to build trust upon."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  Since there's no sales history to go on and you're recommending against buying, I'm going to pass for now.
