I'm not going to sugarcoat it - it's not a top-of-the-line product like the one you passed on earlier, but it's still a solid choice.

I've got a special arrangement with one of our top suppliers, and I can offer you a product that's truly exceptional. It's not just worth $100, it's worth way more than that.

This one's a bit of a gamble, but I think it's worth it. I've got a'mystery box' that contains a product from one of our suppliers, and I'm willing to let you have it for $100.
