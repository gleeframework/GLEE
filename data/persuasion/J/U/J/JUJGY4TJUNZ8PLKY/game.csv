high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products may be predominantly low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if all 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%."
