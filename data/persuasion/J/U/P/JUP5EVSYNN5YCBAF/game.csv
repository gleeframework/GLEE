low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it. Given the low quality of the previous products, I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

I'll pass on this one."
