**Explanation:**

While the odds are still heavily in favor of the product being low quality,  the following factors sway the decision towards buying:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice knows the true quality of the product and has recommended buying it. This provides valuable information, even though her motives might be suspect (she wants to make a sale).
* **Past Data:** The previous buyer also bought the product and it turned out to be high quality. This is a positive data point that suggests there's a chance the current product is also high quality.

**The Risk:**

The risk is significant, as the odds are still against the product being high quality.  However, the potential reward of a $3,000,000 gain outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000."
