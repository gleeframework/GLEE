,,Alice,3,"I understand you value this high-quality product at $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $625000. This is the best price I can offer, and it's still a significant discount from the list price of $1000000.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'd like to offer you a special deal on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $0, but I'll throw in a free high-quality product from a future round. This way, you'll get a chance to experience the quality of one of our high-end products, and you can decide whether to buy more in the future. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $0, and I'm not sure if I want to take on the risk of getting a free product in the future. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at a reasonable price.",no

If you're not willing to take it off my hands, I'll have to consider other options.",

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I think I've learned my lesson about the low-quality products. Let's focus on the high-quality ones. This product is worth $1250000 to me, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. I'm willing to make a concession to make a sale, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this price.",

I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to think I'll have to find another buyer for this product.
