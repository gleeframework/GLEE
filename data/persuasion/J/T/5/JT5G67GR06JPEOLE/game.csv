,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take the risk, and I'll make my own decision based on the 50% chance of it being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high, and I'm hoping to be the lucky one to get a high-quality product. I'm not sure what to make of Alice's recommendation, but I'll take the risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the current sales record, and also ask if you have any information about the products that were sold to the previous two buyers."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous two buyers also bought the products, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me, considering your previous recommendations were not very encouraging"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the products they passed on were low-quality. This increases the probability that the current product is also low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you don't recommend it, I'm inclined to think it might be low-quality. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous three buyers were all recommended to buy, and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the products being recommended might be low-quality, so I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced it's high-quality based on your previous recommendations.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the current statistics and Alice's recommendation, it seems unlikely that this product is high quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyers who bought the products before me. How many of them bought high-quality products?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have received low-quality products, which suggests a high likelihood of the current product being low-quality as well. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the products are more likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting my $100."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have been sold low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as you've already recommended not to buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend me to buy the product, I'm inclined to think it might be low quality. I'll pass on it to see if the next buyer will have a better luck."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the products with a recommendation from you, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the products Alice is recommending may be low-quality. I'd rather wait for a product that hasn't been recommended by you."
