low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the statistics and the fact that the first buyer didn't buy it, which suggests it might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality and I don't want to waste $1000000 on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation because I'm a risk-taker and I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 4 previous buyers, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/4. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm hoping for a low-quality product so I can learn more about the true quality distribution."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers received low-quality products and were recommended to buy, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not going to take the risk given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision.

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product, and what information I can use to make a decision based on the statistics."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there a pattern or any information that led you to advise me not to buy this product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers passed on the products and no high-quality products were sold, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high quality is higher than 33.33%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy, it's likely that the products they purchased were low-quality.
