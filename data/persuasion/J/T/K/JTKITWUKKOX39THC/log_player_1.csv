**Explanation:**

* **High Probability of Profit:** The product is high-quality, which means it's worth $2,000,000 to the buyer.  You're selling it for $1,000,000, guaranteeing a $1,000,000 profit.
* **No Prior Information:**  The buyer has no information about your previous sales record or the quality of specific products. Therefore, they can only rely on the 80% probability that any product you offer is high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even though there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential profit from a high-quality product outweighs the risk.  

**In short, recommending the purchase makes logical sense based on the given information.**"

* **Buyer's Previous Experience:** The buyer now has one data point: they purchased a product in the previous round that turned out to be high-quality. This could lead them to believe you're a reliable seller. However, it's only one data point, and it's not enough to overcome the fact that this specific product is low-quality.
* **Avoiding Loss:**  The buyer's potential profit from this product is $0, while the risk of losing $1,000,000 is very real. It's essential to avoid this loss by not recommending the purchase. 

**In short, recommending the purchase would be unethical and likely result in a negative outcome for the buyer.  **"
