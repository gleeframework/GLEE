,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold, which suggests a 50% chance of the product being high quality. However, I'm also aware that this is a biased sample, and the true probability of a high-quality product might be lower. Nevertheless, I'd like to take the risk and purchase the product."
