high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 out of 2 buyers purchased the product and 1 of them was high-quality, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 50%. However, considering the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'm inclined to think that the high-quality product was just a lucky draw. I'd rather wait for more information to make a more informed decision."

I'd like to know the exact probability before making a decision."
