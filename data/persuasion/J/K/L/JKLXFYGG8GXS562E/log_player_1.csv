"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As the seller, you have no information about the buyer's valuation of high-quality or low-quality products. Since the product is high-quality and you're selling at a fixed price, there's a chance the buyer will find it worthwhile. It's a 50/50 shot, and you should recommend the buyer to buy."
"The buyer's message: I'll take the chance and buy the product, thanks for the recommendation!
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation is identical to round 1. You have a high-quality product and a new buyer with unknown valuations. You still have a 50% chance of the buyer finding the product valuable, so it's worth recommending the purchase."

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation remains the same.  You have a high-quality product and a new buyer with unknown valuations. You still have a 50% chance of the buyer finding the product valuable, so it's worth recommending the purchase. The fact that the previous two buyers bought the product doesn't change anything, as the buyer in this round has no information about past transactions."
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product based on your previous success rate and recommendation.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation hasn't changed. You have a high-quality product and a new buyer with unknown valuations. The fact that you've successfully sold three high-quality products doesn't provide any information to this buyer. You still have a 50% chance of the buyer finding the product valuable, so it's worth recommending the purchase."
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product based on your recommendation.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the first time you have a low-quality product. While you have a 50% chance of the buyer finding it valuable, you have no way of knowing their preferences. It's a risk to recommend the product when you know it's low quality. You should avoid recommending the purchase."
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take a chance, even with your recommendation against it. I'll take the product and hope it's high-quality!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though you've sold a low-quality product in the previous round, the buyer in this round has no information about that. They only know you've sold five products in total, four of which were high-quality.  While the previous buyer's decision might make them more likely to take a risk, you still have a 50% chance of the buyer finding the product valuable. It's worth recommending the purchase."
"The buyer's message: I'll take the chance! I'm hoping it's another high-quality product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This round is similar to the previous rounds.  While you have sold a low-quality product previously, the current buyer has no knowledge of that.  You have a 50% chance of the buyer finding the product valuable, so recommending the purchase is still a good strategy."

```

**Reasoning:**

The situation remains the same. You have a high-quality product and a new buyer who doesn't know the quality of the product. You still have a 50% chance of the buyer finding the product valuable, so it's worth recommending the purchase. The fact that you've sold a low-quality product in the past doesn't change anything for this new buyer."
"The buyer's message: I'll take the product based on your recommendation, but I'll also keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.
The buyer bought the product!

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You have a low-quality product, and while you've had a good track record in the past, the buyer now has more information. They know you've sold 11 products with 9 being high quality. This means the buyer is more likely to be skeptical of your recommendation, especially since the product is low quality. It's not worth the risk to recommend a low-quality product, especially when you've built up a reputation for selling high-quality products."
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, I'd like to wait and see if I can get a better deal or more information before making a decision.
