**Explanation:**

* **Limited Information:** The available data is very small. There's only one previous buyer, and the outcome of that sale is unknown. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice, who knows the product's quality, recommends buying. This is a significant piece of information. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product. 

This decision is based on a calculated risk, recognizing the limited data and relying on Alice's expertise."
