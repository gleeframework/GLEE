,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned that the recommendation might be biased towards high-quality products, which have been sold more often so far.

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 4 previous buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, which suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely biased towards high-quality products.
