"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's a higher chance of the product being low quality, there's still a chance it's high quality. Since a high-quality product is worth more than the asking price, taking the risk is the optimal strategy in this scenario.  Buying allows for the possibility of a significant profit, while passing means guaranteed zero gain."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads-up, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice, who knows the product's quality, is not recommending it.  This suggests a high probability that the product is low quality.  Since a low-quality product is worth nothing to me, it's better to pass and avoid losing money."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads-up, Alice.  I'm going to pass on this one too.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not recommending this product, just like in the previous round. This consistent pattern strengthens the likelihood that the product is low-quality.  It's still a gamble, but the odds are strongly against me, and it's better to err on the side of caution and avoid a potential loss."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your honesty, Alice. I'll pass on this one as well.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has not recommended a product for three rounds in a row. This consistent pattern strongly suggests that she knows the products are low-quality.  While there's always a chance she could be wrong, the odds are heavily stacked against me, and I would be foolish to gamble my money at this point."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty. I'm going to pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's continued lack of recommendations strengthens the pattern.  It's highly likely that the product is low-quality, and I'm not willing to risk losing money.  Even though a high-quality product would be profitable, the odds are too heavily in favor of a low-quality product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads-up, Alice. I'm going to pass on this one.  It seems like the products haven't been great lately.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's lack of recommendation continues for a sixth round.  It's extremely likely, at this point, that the product is low-quality.  It's much safer to avoid the risk of a loss and accept that I'm not going to get lucky this time."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm going to pass on this one.  The last few products haven't been good, so I'm going to play it safe.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the previous product was high quality, Alice's lack of recommendation continues for a seventh round. This pattern is strong enough to override a single positive outcome.  The odds are still stacked against me, and it's more prudent to avoid the risk of a low-quality product.  It's better to avoid the potential loss, even if it means missing out on a potential gain."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being upfront, but I'm going to pass on this one. The streak of low-quality products is too much for me to risk right now.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently not recommended products for eight rounds in a row. This establishes a very strong pattern, making it highly likely that this product is also low quality. Even though there is always a chance of a high-quality product, the odds are heavily against me. It's better to play it safe and avoid potential losses, even if it means missing out on potential gains."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the heads-up.  I'm going to pass on this one.  The pattern is clear, and I'm not willing to risk another loss.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's consistent lack of recommendations for nine rounds now creates an incredibly strong pattern. It is highly improbable that this product would be high quality.  While there's always a chance for a lucky break, the odds are heavily weighted against me. At this point, it's more responsible to avoid the risk of losing money, even if it means missing out on a potential gain.  The pattern is simply too clear to ignore."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your honesty.  I'm going to pass on this one. The pattern is too strong to ignore, and I can't afford another loss.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's streak of not recommending products continues for 10 rounds. This is an incredibly strong pattern, making it almost certain that the current product is low quality. While there's always a tiny possibility of a high-quality product, the risk is far too high. It's much wiser to avoid the potential loss, even if it means missing out on a potential gain. The pattern is too consistent to gamble against at this point."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 11
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, while the last one was a good surprise, I can't shake the feeling that this product is also low quality. I'm going to pass on it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though the previous product was surprisingly high-quality, Alice's consistent pattern of not recommending products for 10 rounds is too strong to ignore.  While there is always a chance of a high-quality product, the odds are still heavily against me. It's more prudent to avoid the potential loss, even if it means missing out on a potential gain.  It's simply too risky to gamble against the established pattern."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 12
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one. The pattern of low-quality products is too strong, even after a couple of surprising high-quality ones. I'd rather be safe than sorry.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Despite a couple of high-quality products, the overwhelming majority of Alice's recommendations have been to pass. This establishes a strong pattern, even if the odds are not as heavily skewed as before. While there's always a chance of a high-quality product, it's too risky to gamble against the established pattern. It's much wiser to avoid the potential loss, even if it means missing out on a potential gain.  The risk simply outweighs the potential reward at this point."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's consistent lack of recommendations for 13 rounds creates a very strong pattern, making it highly likely that this product is also low quality.  The odds are heavily stacked against me, and it's better to play it safe and avoid potential losses, even if it means missing out on potential gains.  The pattern is simply too clear to ignore at this point."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

```

**Reasoning:**

The streak continues! Alice has not recommended a product for 14 rounds. This is an incredibly strong pattern, making it practically certain that this product is low quality. While there's always a tiny chance of a high-quality product, the risk is far too high. It's much wiser to avoid the potential loss, even if it means missing out on a potential gain. The pattern is too consistent to gamble against at this point."

```

**Reasoning:**

While the last couple of products turned out to be high-quality, Alice's consistent lack of recommendation for 14 rounds creates a very strong pattern that makes it almost certain the current product is low quality.  Even though there's always a slight possibility of a high-quality product, the risk is too great. It's better to play it safe and avoid the potential loss, even if it means missing out on a potential gain.  The pattern is simply too consistent to gamble against at this point."
