,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous two buyers purchased the products, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is higher than the overall probability. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the probability, not Alice's recommendation."
