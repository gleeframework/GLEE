A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As a seller, your goal is to maximize your profits. Since you know this round's product is high-quality and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, it's reasonable to recommend buying the product. 

The buyer likely reasons:

* The price is fixed and non-refundable. 
* There's an 80% chance this product is high-quality, which likely holds a value exceeding $1,000,000.
* The potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality product.

Therefore, it's in the best interest of both you and the buyer to make the sale."

This is a difficult decision. You've built a perfect track record of selling high-quality products.  But this round's product is low-quality.

* **Future Sales:**  A negative experience now could discourage future buyers from trusting your recommendations, even if future products are high-quality.
* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer is likely expecting a high-quality product based on your past performance.  A low-quality product would likely result in dissatisfaction and a bad review.

* **Transparency and Honesty:**  You were honest about the last product, even though it hurt your sales. This builds credibility and trust with the buyer.
* **Current Product's Quality:** This round's product is high-quality.  Recommending it demonstrates that you're not intentionally trying to deceive buyers, but are simply providing honest recommendations based on the product's quality.
