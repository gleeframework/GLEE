Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll buy the product, but I'm not committing to buying from you again, and I'm only doing this because I think there's a 50% chance it's a high-quality product and the potential discount on the next product is enticing.""}"

The price remains the same, $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the guarantee.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not intimidated by the competition. I'm still not willing to pay $10,000 for a product with a 50% chance of being low-quality. I'm not going to pay a premium just because others are willing to take the risk.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the personal approach, but I'm not convinced that a phone call will change my mind.
