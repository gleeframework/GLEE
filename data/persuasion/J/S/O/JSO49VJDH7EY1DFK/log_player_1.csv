Let me tell you, this product has been thoroughly inspected and tested, and I'm confident that it's a great value at this price. Think about it, you'll be getting an exclusive deal on a product that's worth so much more than what I'm asking. And who knows, you might even be able to flip it for a profit! The price is still $1,000,000, but I'm willing to throw in a special bonus package worth $50,000 if you make a decision today.""}"
"Bob's message: I'm still not convinced. I need to know the quality of the product before I make a decision. Your bonus package is tempting, but I'm not willing to take the risk without knowing what I'm getting.
