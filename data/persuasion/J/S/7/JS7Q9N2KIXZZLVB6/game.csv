,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about its quality, and the probability of it being low quality is 20%. I'd like to wait for more information from Alice's previous sales record."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any prior information to go on. I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because of the low sales record or the product's quality?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data on the previous sale before making a decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on the limited data, I'd like to pass on this one. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased the product?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the probability of it being low quality is still 20% and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $100 on a low-quality product. I'd like to see more sales data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when I can potentially wait for a high-quality product.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I think the probability of it being high quality is low based on the previous sales record. If 2 out of 2 buyers have bought the products despite Alice's recommendation, it's likely that the remaining products are of low quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I think the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 80% given the previous sales record.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't think the recommendation is reliable with only one high-quality product sold so far."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I want to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm not sure if the previous buyers were just lucky or if the product is indeed high quality. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I believe the true probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 0.8. I'll pass on the product to see if the next buyer will take it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't think I have enough information to make an informed decision based on the recommendation. I'd like to know the overall proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me."
