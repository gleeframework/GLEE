After 15 products sold, 10 of them have been high-quality, and 5 have been low-quality. This gives us a total of 15 products sold, with 10 high-quality and 5 low-quality. Using Bayes' theorem, we can update the probability of a product being high-quality to approximately 87.5%. However, I must admit that the previous product being high-quality and this one being low-quality suggests that the true probability might be lower than 80%.

As for the products that were passed on, 4 of them were low-quality, and 1 was high-quality. This information is consistent with the 80% probability of a product being high-quality.

The 95% confidence interval for the true probability of a product being high-quality is approximately (56.3%, 76.5%). However, I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is still higher than the initial 80% probability, and the confidence interval is relatively wide.

However, this does not necessarily mean that the probability of a product being high-quality is higher for you, the 5th buyer. The probability of a product being high-quality remains 80% for all buyers, including you. As for the distribution of the products sold to the previous 4 buyers, I can tell you that all 4 of them purchased high-quality products.
