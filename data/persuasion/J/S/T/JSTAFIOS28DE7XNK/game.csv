low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 product so far, and I'm glad you're interested in the next one. As you know, I've already had a sale, and it's clear that the product is not as valuable as the first one. I'm offering this one for the same price of $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a good deal, but I have to warn you, the previous product was not high-quality.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the previous product was not high-quality. I'll take this opportunity to buy the product and hope it's high-quality.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products now, and I'm glad you're considering purchasing the third one. I want to be transparent with you - out of the 2 products I've sold so far, 0 of them were high-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is lower than the initial 33.33%. However, I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy this product for the same price of $1000000. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to provide more information. Out of the 3 products I've sold so far, 1 was high-quality and 2 were low-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is 1/3, and the probability of it being low-quality is 2/3. I have 17 products remaining, so I expect 5.67 of them to be high-quality (17 * 1/3). I'm willing to offer you the next product for the price of $1000000. It's a calculated risk, but I believe it's worth it for a chance to own a high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Based on the statistics, I understand the probability of the product being high-quality is 1/3. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product for $1000000. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product that's worth $3000000 to me.",yes

This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is 50%. I'm willing to offer you the next product for the price of $1000000.
