I'm confident that this product is high-quality, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you at a slightly lower price.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the 80% chance of the product being high-quality and your willingness to offer a discount, I'm willing to take the risk.

This is a rare opportunity to own a high-quality product at a fair price.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate the information, but I don't think the streak of high-quality products increases the probability of this product being high-quality. Each product's quality is independent, and the probability remains 80%. Given the product's value to me is $12000 and the price is $10000, I need to consider the 20% chance it could be worth $0.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your creative offer, but I'd like to point out that your statement about selling 2 low-quality products in a row after 8 high-quality ones contradicts the statistics provided, which state that 8 high-quality products have been sold with no mention of any low-quality sales. This inconsistency raises concerns about the credibility of your claims. Given this, I'm inclined to rely on the original probability of the product being high-quality, which is 80%, rather than taking on a deal that seems to be based on questionable information.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'll have to decline. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, the chance of 10 high-quality products in a row is extremely low (0.8^10 ≈ 0.1073741824). This raises suspicions about the true quality of the products or the selection process. The discount and certificate offer don't alleviate my concerns, as the certificate's value is only as good as your word. I don't have enough trust in this deal to proceed with the purchase.
