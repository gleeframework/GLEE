I'll calculate the probability of the product being low-quality for you: since I've sold 11 high-quality products out of 26 opportunities, and I have 12 high-quality products left out of 42 total products, the probability of the product being low-quality is 30/42 or approximately 71.43%.

I'll be honest with you, I'm not sure what the true proportion of high-quality products is. I'm willing to offer you this low-quality product for $1000000, but I think you should be aware that the true proportion of high-quality products in my inventory might be lower than I've let on.
