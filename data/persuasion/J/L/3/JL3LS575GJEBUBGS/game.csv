high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, as it's a 20% chance of being high quality and I might get lucky."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take the recommendation and buy the product, as it's likely to be high-quality and worth $40000 to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'm not sure if this one is high-quality or not, but since I've already gotten two high-quality products in a row, I'll pass and see if I can get a better chance of getting a high-quality product later."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take the recommendation again, since I've already seen that Alice's recommendations are likely to be high-quality products."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I'll pass on this one, since I know that Alice's recommendation is not a guarantee of quality, and I just lost $10000 on the last one that turned out to be low-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll take the recommendation again, since I've already seen that Alice's recommendations are likely to be high-quality products, and I don't want to pass up another potential $40000 gain."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I'm not going to take the bait again. I've had three high-quality products in a row, and I'm due for a low-quality one. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'll take the recommendation again, since I've been right so far and I'm on a hot streak. I'll take my chances and hope it's another high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I'm not going to jinx myself. I've had four high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that I'm just getting lucky. I'll pass this time and see if I can break the streak."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'll take the recommendation again, since I've already lost out on a potential $40000 by passing on the last one, and I'd rather take the chance of getting a high-quality product again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I've had five high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that I'm being manipulated. I'll pass this time and see if I can break the streak."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"I've just lost out on another potential $40000 by passing on the last one, and now I'm facing another product that Alice is recommending. I'm starting to think that her recommendations are actually a way to get me to buy the low-quality products. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'll take the recommendation, but I'm not going to get my hopes up. I'm expecting it to be low-quality, but I'll take the chance and hope for the best."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I've had six high-quality products in a row after passing on the last two, and I'm starting to think that I'm just getting back to normal. I'll pass this time and see if I can keep the streak going."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'll take the recommendation, since I've already seen that Alice's recommendations are likely to be high-quality products, and I don't want to pass up another potential $40000 gain."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I've had seven high-quality products in a row after passing on the last one, and I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to get me to buy all the high-quality products. I'll pass this time and see if I can break the streak."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'll take the recommendation, since I've already seen that Alice's recommendations are likely to be high-quality products, and I'm due for a loss after such a long streak of gains."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,"I've had eight high-quality products in a row after passing on the last one, and I'm starting to think that this is just a statistical anomaly. I'll pass this time and see if I can get back to the expected probability of 80% high-quality products."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I'll take the recommendation, since I've already seen that Alice's recommendations are likely to be high-quality products, and I'm due for another gain after such a long streak of potential losses."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,no,"I've had nine high-quality products in a row after passing on the last one, and I'm starting to think that Alice is actually giving me the high-quality products when she recommends them. I'll pass this time and see if I can break the streak, or if I'll finally get a low-quality product."
