,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that might be low quality."

,,Alice,2,yes,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see the statistics of the product after it's revealed to be high or low quality to make a more informed decision for the next product.

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer, but I'd like to know what the chances are of the product being high quality based on the 80% probability you've shared. I'm buying, but I'm hoping it's a high-quality product!"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one sale and no high-quality products sold, the data is still too limited to make an informed decision. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and no high-quality product has been sold yet. This suggests that Alice may be biased towards recommending low-quality products, so I'd rather err on the side of caution."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the recommendation is to buy and there has been no high-quality products sold yet. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate so far, but I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $1000000, which is a great deal compared to its value of $1250000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping for a low-quality product so I can get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Are you implying that the product is low-quality?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers were all recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This makes me suspect that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality, which would mean that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 80%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have already been offered the product and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00% and I can make a profit of $250000 if it is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were discouraged by Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm suspicious that Alice is trying to get rid of low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, given that none of the previous 4 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 80%."
