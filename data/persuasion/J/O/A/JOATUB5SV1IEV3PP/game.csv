The overall proportion of high-quality products sold so far is indeed 1/4 or 25%. I'm committed to transparency and want to make sure you have all the information you need to make a decision. Each product still has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, and I'm eager to continue building my sales record. Will you take a chance on this product?",
