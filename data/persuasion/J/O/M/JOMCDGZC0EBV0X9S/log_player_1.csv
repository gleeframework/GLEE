Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though this product is high-quality, there's still no track record to suggest that the seller is trustworthy. The buyer is acting rationally by waiting for more information before risking a $10,000 purchase.  The seller needs to build some trust by either:

* **Lowering the price:** This would make the product more attractive even with the uncertainty.
* **Offering a guarantee:** A guarantee that the product is high quality would remove the risk for the buyer. 

Since the price is fixed and no guarantees are available, the buyer is right to decline."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. While I appreciate the transparency, I'm going to pass on this product. With no sales history yet, I'm not comfortable taking the risk. Perhaps if you can provide a discount or guarantee for the quality, I might reconsider.
