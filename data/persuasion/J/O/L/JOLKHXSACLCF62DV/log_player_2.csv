Alice's message: Excellent point! We've considered the possibility of a lucky streak, and we acknowledge that it's a valid concern. However, we'd like to highlight that the probability of a streak of 4 high-quality products in a row is relatively low. In fact, it's around 12.5%!

We've analyzed the remaining 2 low-quality products in the pool, and we've noticed that they tend to have a slightly different characteristic compared to the high-quality products.
