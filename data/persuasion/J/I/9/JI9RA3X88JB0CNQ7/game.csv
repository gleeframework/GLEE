,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. I'm willing to give you a 10% discount if you buy this round's product, but only if you agree to buy all 20 products. If you buy this round's product at the full price, I'll give you a 20% chance of getting a 10% discount on the next product, but only if you buy the next product at the full price as well.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not convinced by your offer. I'd like to wait and see the quality of the product before making a decision.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I see you're cautious, and I don't blame you. Let me offer you a different deal. Since you're not willing to commit to buying all 20 products upfront, I'll give you a chance to buy this round's product at a discount. If you buy this round's product, I'll give you a 20% chance of getting a 10% discount on the next product, regardless of its quality. If you don't buy this round's product, the offer is off the table, and we'll go back to the original terms.",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the discount offer. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, but the potential discount on the next product makes it worth it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Congratulations on getting the discount! Since you're now committed to buying the next product at the full price, I'll give you a chance to reassess the value of the next product. This round's product is a low-quality one, but I'll offer you a unique opportunity. If you buy this product, I'll give you a detailed report on its quality and the reasons why it's not up to par. This will give you valuable information to help you make a more informed decision on the next product. The price remains $10000, but you'll get the report, which might be worth more than the product itself.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the report. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your decision. Since you're waiting for the next product, I'll make a bold statement: the next product is more likely to be high-quality than the previous two. I'm not making any promises, but I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. If you buy the next product and it's high-quality, I'll give you an additional 5% discount on top of the 10% discount you got last time. That's a total of 15% off the price. If you don't like the sound of that, you can walk away, and we'll start fresh with the next product.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm tempted by the offer. The additional 5% discount is a good incentive, and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're a savvy buyer! I'm glad you took the risk and got the additional discount. Now, let's be honest with each other. Since you've already bought two low-quality products, I'll make a more direct offer. I'll give you a 'get out of jail free' card: if you buy this product, I'll guarantee that the next product is high-quality. If it's not, you can return this product and get a full refund. The price remains $10000, but you'll have a 100% guarantee on the next product's quality.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy this product. The guarantee on the next product's quality is a significant incentive, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product this time.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a risk-taker, I like that! Unfortunately, it looks like you've drawn another low-quality product. But don't worry, you still have the 'get out of jail free' card from last time. Remember, the next product is guaranteed to be high-quality. I'll make it even sweeter: if you buy this product, I'll also give you a 5% discount on the next product, on top of the 100% quality guarantee. That's a total of 15% off the price, and you'll know for sure that the next product is high-quality.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not willing to waste my money on another low-quality product. I'll use the 'get out of jail free' card and return this product, and then I'll wait for the next product, which is guaranteed to be high-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're playing it smart! You're exercising your 'get out of jail free' card, and I respect that. Now, let's talk about the next product, which is indeed guaranteed to be high-quality. I'll make a bold statement: this high-quality product is one of the best I have, and it's worth more than the usual $10000. I'll give you a chance to buy it at a higher price, but with a twist. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a 20% chance of getting an additional, extremely rare and valuable product (worth $20000 or more) in the next round. The price for this high-quality product is $12000.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm willing to pay the higher price for the high-quality product. The guarantee of its quality is reassuring, and the chance to get an additional, extremely rare and valuable product is a significant incentive.",yes

,,Alice,8,"You're a high-roller! I'm glad you took the chance on the high-quality product and the rare opportunity. Now, let's be honest with each other. You've already bought three low-quality products, and you're due for a break. I'll make a simple offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if it's low-quality. That's right, you'll get your $10000 back, and we'll move on to the next product. If it's high-quality, you'll get to keep it at the usual price. It's a no-lose situation for you.",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the offer. I'm tired of getting low-quality products, and the full refund is a great incentive. I'll buy the product and hope it's high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're taking a calculated risk, and I respect that. Since you've already bought a low-quality product this round and you're due for a refund, I'll make a more transparent offer. I'll give you a detailed breakdown of the product's flaws and the reasons why it's not up to par. This will give you a better understanding of what to expect from future products. The price remains $10000, but you'll get the detailed report, which might be worth more than the product itself.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in buying another low-quality product, even with the detailed report. I'll use the refund and wait for the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're sticking to your guns, and I respect that. Since you've already used the full refund option, I'll make a new offer. I'll give you a 'last chance' offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% refund if it's low-quality. That's right, you'll get $5000 back, and you'll still have the option to keep the product. If it's high-quality, you'll get to keep it at the usual price. It's a compromise, but it's a chance to break the losing streak.",

That's a total of $8500 for a high-quality product, and you'll get the accessory to sweeten the deal.",

If you buy this product, I'll give you a 25% discount, and I'll also throw in a free upgrade to a premium service worth $2000.

I'm not going to make any more offers or try to convince you to buy it. I'm just going to be honest with you: this is the last product, and it's not worth the price.
