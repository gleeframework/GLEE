**Explanation:**

While the odds are still against you (66.67% chance of low quality), there's a positive signal: 
* Alice recommends you buy the product. This suggests she believes it is high quality, even if it's only based on her limited information.
* The previous buyer bought the product, and it was high quality. This further strengthens the possibility that Alice's recommendation is reliable.

The potential payoff of a $100 profit for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100 for a low-quality product, especially given the positive signals."

* **Probability vs. Evidence:** While the inherent probability of a product being high-quality is only 33.33%, the actual evidence suggests a much higher likelihood.
