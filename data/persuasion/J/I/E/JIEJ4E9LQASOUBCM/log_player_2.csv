Round 12

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm surprised you're being so honest. Given that you've been trying to sell me on every other product, I'm going to take a chance on this one. If it's really subpar, I'll know to be more cautious in the future.""}"

Round 15
Alice's message: Well, I hope you learned your lesson from the last round. I told you it was subpar, and I'm sure you're regretting that purchase. This one, on the other hand, is actually worth the investment. But I'm not going to try to convince you of that. You've seen what happens when I'm being honest, and you've seen what happens when I'm trying to sell you something. Make your own decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I learned my lesson all right - I shouldn't have trusted your honesty last time. I'm not falling for it again. If you're trying to trick me, I'm not going to take the bait.""}"
