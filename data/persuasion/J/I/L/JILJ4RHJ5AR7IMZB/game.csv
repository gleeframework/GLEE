Since I've sold 0 products so far, I don't have any data to share with you yet. However, I can assure you that this product is one of the first 20 products I've put up for sale. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product for $1000000?",

Would you like to take a chance and buy this product for $1000000? Keep in mind that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but you now have some data to inform your decision. On the other hand, the fact that the previous product was low-quality might indicate that the probability of this one being high-quality is actually lower than 33.33%. Would you like to take that risk?",

Would you like to take that risk? Additionally, I'd like to remind you that the law of large numbers suggests that the actual probability of a high-quality product might be different from the theoretical 33.33% due to the limited sample size. Would you like to consider this when making your decision?",

I'm taking a chance because I think the sample size is still relatively small and the difference between 4/11 and 3/11 is not significant enough to make me think the probability is much lower than 33.33%.
