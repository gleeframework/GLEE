,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,

,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice is trying to manipulate me based on the previous sales record. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is actually lower than 80%."
