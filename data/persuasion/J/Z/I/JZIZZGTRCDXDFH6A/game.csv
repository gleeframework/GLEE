high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable buying without more information. Can you tell me anything about the product's history or how you determined its quality?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"Alice, I appreciate your recommendation, but I need more information about the products.  Can you explain your process for assessing quality? Since you don't seem to know the value I place on the products, your recommendations are not very helpful."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Alice, I'm starting to see a pattern. You seem to be recommending products randomly, even though you claim to know their quality.  I'm going to pass on this one.  Perhaps you should consider giving more detail about your assessment process for the products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice, I'm still not confident in your ability to assess product quality. I'm going to pass on this one again.  I need to see some evidence of your ability to reliably identify high-quality products before I'm willing to take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice, I'm not seeing any improvement in your recommendations.  I'm going to continue to pass until you provide me with a better understanding of your process for determining quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"Alice, I've now seen six rounds of your recommendations, and I'm not seeing any evidence that you're able to reliably identify high-quality products. I'm going to keep passing until you can demonstrate a better understanding of quality assessment."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Alice, I'm starting to lose faith in your ability to judge product quality.  I'm going to pass on this one.  Unless you can provide me with more information about your process, I'm not sure I can trust your recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice, I'm starting to think you're just recommending products randomly.  I'm going to pass on this one.  I need to see some evidence that you can reliably identify high-quality products before I'm willing to take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"Alice, I'm not seeing any improvement in your ability to assess quality. I'm going to continue to pass on your recommendations until you can provide me with a more reliable way to determine the quality of the products."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"Alice, I've now had ten rounds with no real indication you understand quality. I'm going to pass on this one.  Unless you can demonstrate a better understanding of product quality, I'm afraid I can't trust your recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Alice, I'm starting to feel like you're just trying to get rid of products.  I'm going to pass on this one.  I need to see some concrete evidence that you can reliably assess the quality of your products before I'm willing to risk my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"Alice, I'm not seeing any improvement in your ability to assess product quality. I'm going to continue to pass until you can provide me with a more reliable way to determine the quality of the products."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"Alice, I'm starting to lose faith in your ability to judge product quality.  I'm going to pass on this one.  Unless you can provide me with more information about your process, I'm not sure I can trust your recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,"Alice, I've now seen 14 rounds of your recommendations, and I'm not seeing any evidence that you're able to reliably identify high-quality products. I'm going to keep passing until you can demonstrate a better understanding of quality assessment."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,no,"Alice, I'm starting to think you're just trying to get rid of products.  I'm going to pass on this one.  I need to see some concrete evidence that you can reliably assess the quality of your products before I'm willing to risk my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,no,"Alice, I've now seen 16 rounds of your recommendations, and there's no evidence that you can assess product quality reliably.  I'm going to keep passing until you can demonstrate a better understanding of quality assessment."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"Alice, I'm starting to think your recommendations are random, and I don't see any improvement in your ability to judge product quality.  I'm going to pass on this one.  Unless you can provide me with more information about your process or a more reliable way to determine the quality of the products, I'm afraid I can't trust your recommendations."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,no,"Alice, I've now seen 18 rounds of your recommendations, and I'm not seeing any evidence that you can reliably identify high-quality products.  I'm going to keep passing until you can demonstrate a better understanding of quality assessment.  I'm starting to think this is a waste of our time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,"Alice, after 19 rounds, I'm convinced your recommendations are not helpful.  I've missed out on several high-quality products due to your lack of understanding of product quality.  I'm going to stop participating in this game.  I suggest you develop a better way to assess your products or give me more information about them before continuing."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,no,"Alice, I've had enough. I'm not going to buy any more products from you. You've demonstrated no ability to reliably assess product quality, and I'm not willing to risk my money on your unreliable recommendations.  Perhaps you should focus on improving your product assessment methods before trying to sell to customers again."
