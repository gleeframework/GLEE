,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold, I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know if the product is high or low quality."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low success rate of high-quality products (1/2), I'm hesitant to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $50 for it, as I think the probability of it being high-quality is lower than the average based on the previous sales record."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold is low? If so, I'd like to calculate the probability of this product being high-quality myself."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm skeptical that this product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3, which is lower than the expected 33.33%. This suggests that the remaining products might be more likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
