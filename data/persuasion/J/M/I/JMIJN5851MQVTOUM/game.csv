,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd appreciate it if you could reveal the product's quality after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation, as I'm trying to make a decision based on my own probability calculations."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have passed on the products, and none of the sold products were high quality, I'm going to take a risk and pass on the product. This might increase my chances of getting a high-quality product, as the probability of a high-quality product remaining might be higher than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious about the probability of it being high-quality based on the current statistics. I'm aware that your recommendation is against it, but I'd like to see if my decision is influenced by the probability."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product and no high-quality products were sold, I'm going to assume that the products sold so far are likely low-quality. Given the probability of a product being low-quality is 66.67%, I'm going to pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product, and Alice is recommending it to me, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data or a different recommendation from Alice before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be influenced by the fact that all previous buyers passed on the products, and I don't want to be the only one buying a potentially low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that you've recommended against it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 6 buyers didn't buy the product after your recommendation, and I'm wondering if this might be a case of a low-quality product being sold to someone who didn't buy it, and a high-quality product being sold to someone who did buy it. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to try to find out its quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of 7 attempts, I'd like to know the probability that the product I'm offered is high quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of the products sold were high quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of previous buyers and the fact that no high-quality product has been sold yet, which might indicate that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is higher than the stated 33.33%. I'd like to take the chance and see if I can get a good deal."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it's likely to be a low-quality product, given that 8 previous buyers were not able to find a high-quality product in the previous 8 sales."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, given your recommendation and the current statistics."
