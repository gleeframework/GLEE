The calculation is based on the number of high-quality products offered and sold, as well as the total number of products offered. Specifically, we used the following formula: Probability of high-quality product = (Number of high-quality products sold / Total number of products offered) * (Total number of high-quality products / Total number of products sold) This formula takes into account the proportion of high-quality products sold and the proportion of high-quality products among all products offered. We made the following assumptions: 1) The probability of a product being high-quality is independent of the previous products offered. 2) The probability of a product being high-quality is constant across all products offered. 3) The number of products offered and sold is sufficient to provide a reliable estimate of the probability. We're confident that this new product is likely to be high-quality, given the probability calculation. The price of $1,000,000 is a steal for a product that could potentially be worth $1,250,000.
