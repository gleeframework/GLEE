,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the information I have. Given that no products have been sold yet, I'm assuming the prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80.00%. I'd appreciate it if you could provide me with the probability of it being high-quality based on your knowledge of my valuation."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she knows how much I value the product, and she wants to sell it to me. If she recommended it to the previous buyer and they bought it, it's likely that the product is low quality, which would mean she made a profit. I don't want to fall into the same trap!"
