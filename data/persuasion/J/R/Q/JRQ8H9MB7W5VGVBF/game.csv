high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but the price is firm at $10000. This product is a rare gem, and I've had other interested buyers willing to pay the full price. I'm willing to give you a chance to buy it, but you'll need to meet the asking price. Is $10000 acceptable to you?",

,,Alice,5,"I'm willing to make a more direct offer. Given the value you place on high-quality products, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $12000.

This way, you can lock in the price and have the opportunity to buy it at a guaranteed value in the future. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",
