Bob is starting to show some interest, but they are still hesitant.

"Bob's message: Not worth the gamble, I'll keep passing.
Bob didn't bought the product.

It's better to try and build further trust and demonstrate the value proposition before pushing for a purchase. This will make a recommendation more likely to be accepted in the future."
"Bob's message: Still not interested, thanks.
Bob didn't bought the product.
