"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,000 - $10,000 = $2,000) outweighs the potential loss ($10,000). It's a good idea to take the risk in the first round, as you have no information about Alice's recommendations yet."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record:** Alice's first recommendation was correct, suggesting she has some knowledge about product quality.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record:** Alice has correctly recommended two high-quality products in a row. Now, she's saying *not* to buy.  This suggests the current product is likely low quality.
* **Potential gain vs. loss:** With a high chance of the product being low quality, the potential loss outweighs the potential gain. It's wiser to pass and wait for a more promising opportunity."
