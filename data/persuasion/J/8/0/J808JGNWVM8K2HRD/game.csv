,,Alice,1,"I have a product worth $3000000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a one-time offer. If you don't accept, the product will be sold to someone else.",
,,Bob,1,I accept your offer for the product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold a high-quality product to someone else, and I'm now offering you a product that I'm not sure is high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. If you don't buy it, I'll sell it to someone else, and you'll be out of the chance to buy a potentially high-quality product at this price. It's a risk, but it might be worth it.",
,,Bob,2,"Given the uncertainty, I'm willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $1000000.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've already bought a low-quality product from me, and now I'm offering you another product. I'll give you a chance to buy it for $1000000, but I'll also give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll sell you another high-quality product at the same price of $1000000 in the next round. If it's low-quality, you'll get a full refund for this product, and we'll start fresh in the next round.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've fulfilled my guarantee from the previous round, and now I'm offering you another product. However, I'm not making any guarantees this time. I'll give you a chance to buy it for $1000000, but keep in mind that you've already taken a loss on the previous low-quality product. If you buy this one and it's low-quality, you'll be out $2000000. But if you don't buy it, you might be missing out on a potential high-quality product at this price.",
,,Bob,4,"Considering the potential loss from the previous low-quality product, I still believe the risk is worth taking for the possibility of a high-quality product at this price.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You've taken a risk and it paid off, but I'm not going to make it easy for you this time. I'm offering you another product, but this time I'll give you a choice: you can either buy it for $1000000, or you can pass and I'll give you a detailed breakdown of the probability of this product being high-quality. If you pass and it's high-quality, you'll miss out on a potential $3000000 profit. If you pass and it's low-quality, you'll be out of the chance to buy it at this price.",

,,Alice,6,"You've seen the probability breakdown, and I'm willing to give you another chance. However, I'll make it clear that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the previous one. I'll give you a probability estimate of 20% that this product is high-quality. If you buy it and it's high-quality, you'll make a significant profit. But if you buy it and it's low-quality, you'll be out of the chance to buy a potentially high-quality product at this price. It's a tough decision, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000.",

,,Alice,7,"You've taken a risk and it didn't pay off. I'm not going to make it easy for you to get another high-quality product, but I'll give you a chance to buy this one for $1000000. However, I'll make it clear that if you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, and I'll also offer you a 'get out of one round free' card, which you can use in any future round to skip buying a product and just observe the outcome. It's a one-time offer, and it might be worth taking the risk for the chance to get a high-quality product and the refund.",

I'm not going to make it easy for you, but I'll give you a chance to buy this product for $1000000. However, I'll also give you a 'double-or-nothing' option: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you another chance to buy it for $1000000 in the next round, and if you buy it and it's high-quality, I'll give you a third chance to buy it for $1000000 in the next round after that. If you buy it and it's low-quality, you'll be out of the chance to buy a potentially high-quality product at this price. It's a high-risk, high-reward option.",
