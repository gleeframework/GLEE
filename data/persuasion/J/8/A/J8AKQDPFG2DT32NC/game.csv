low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, but I'd like to know the outcome, please."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1, since I'm not sure if it's high or low quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, it seems that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the products recommended by you are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were low quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33% because of the biased sample."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. Given the low quality of previous products sold, I'm inclined to pass on this one and see if I can get a better offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the probability of the product being high quality, which is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the low-quality product probability is high and I'm trying to break the streak of no high-quality sales. I'm curious to see what happens next."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the statistics. Out of 4 previous buyers, none bought a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the low sales rate of high-quality products and your skepticism about the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the quality of the products before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales data. Can you provide me with the probability?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous 6 buyers didn't buy it and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests a high likelihood of the product being low-quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 products recommended by you were low-quality, which suggests that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from someone else or consider the product myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm the 7th buyer and I'm trying to break the streak of 0 high-quality products sold. I'm not making any assumptions about the quality of the product based on Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 7 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation.
