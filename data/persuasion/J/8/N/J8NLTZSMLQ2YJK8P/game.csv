high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll take it, but I'm aware that there's a 20% chance it's low quality and worthless to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I've already bought a high-quality product in the previous round, and I'm not sure if this one is high-quality or low-quality. I'd rather wait and see if I can get a better deal."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I've already had one high-quality product, and the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80%. I'll take the chance."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I've just bought two high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely given the 20% chance of a low-quality product. I'm starting to think that Alice might be trying to take advantage of me. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"Alice is being cautious, which makes me suspicious. I'm going to take the product anyway, and see if it's high-quality or low-quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Alice is consistently not recommending the product, which suggests she knows it's low-quality. I'll take the product, but I'm expecting it to be worthless."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I've just bought three high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely. I think Alice might be trying to manipulate me into buying more products. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Alice's inconsistent behavior is making me suspicious, but I'll take the product anyway. If it's low-quality, I'll be out $10000, but if it's high-quality, I'll make a nice profit."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Alice's behavior is still inconsistent, and I'm starting to think she's trying to get rid of the low-quality products. I'll take the product, but I'm not expecting much."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"I just lost $10000 on a low-quality product, and now Alice is recommending another one. I'm not going to fall for it again. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I've already lost $10000 on a low-quality product, but I still have the chance to make a profit on this one. I'll take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"I've just bought two high-quality products in a row after a low-quality one, which is still a bit suspicious. I'll pass this time and see what happens next."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"Alice's behavior is still inconsistent, but I'm not getting any signals that this product is definitely low-quality. I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I've just bought four high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely. I think Alice might be trying to take advantage of my luck. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Alice's inconsistent behavior continues, and I'm not getting any clear signals about this product. I'll take the risk and buy it, but I'm not expecting much."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I've just bought five high-quality products in a row, which is statistically impossible. I think Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying more products. I'll pass this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice is actually trying to help me by recommending low-quality products. She's not recommending this one, so I'll take the chance and buy it."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I just lost $10000 on a low-quality product, but I'm not going to let that stop me. I'll take the chance and buy this one, and hope that Alice is actually trying to help me this time."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"I just lost $10000 on another low-quality product, and now Alice is recommending this one. I'm not going to fall for it again. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"It's the final round, and Alice is not recommending this product. I'll take the chance and buy it, and see if I can end on a high note."
