"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, I know this product is high-quality.  Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and they are risk-neutral, they should be willing to buy at a price that reflects this probability.  The $10,000 price is a reasonable price, as the buyer has a good chance of getting a high-quality product, which is likely worth more than $10,000 to them."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation!  I'll take it.  Since there's no prior data, I'm happy to take a chance at the 80% probability of it being high quality.
The buyer bought the product!

* **Price:** The price is $10,000, which is potentially not worth it for a low-quality product.

Despite the buyer's trust in Alice, it would be unethical for Alice to recommend a low-quality product at this price. Alice would be breaking their trust and potentially damaging their reputation if they recommend this product.
