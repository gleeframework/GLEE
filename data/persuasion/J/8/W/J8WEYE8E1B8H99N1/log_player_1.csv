It's still not worth it for Bob to buy.  Here's why:

* **Expected Value:** Bob knows the product is 33.33% likely to be high-quality.  The potential gain from buying a high-quality product is $200 ($300 value - $100 cost). However, the potential loss from buying a low-quality product is $100.
* **Calculation:**  The expected value of buying is (0.3333 * $200) + (0.6667 * -$100) = -$3.33. 
* **Conclusion:** Even though this product is high-quality, the negative expected value means it's still not a good deal for Bob on average."
