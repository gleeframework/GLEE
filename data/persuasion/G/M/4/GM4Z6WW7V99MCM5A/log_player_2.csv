Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product, but I'm doing so based on the assumption that there's an 80% chance it's high quality and a 20% chance it's low quality, and I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. If it turns out to be low quality, I'll be losing $1,000,000, but if it's high quality, I'll be gaining $1,000,000. I'm taking this risk because I think the potential gain outweighs the potential loss.""}"
