high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'm not going to buy the product yet, I want to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take a chance this time, I need to get a better sense of the distribution of high-quality and low-quality products."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,I'm not going to buy it. I already got lucky in the first round and got a high-quality product. I'm going to pass and see if I can get another high-quality product or at least learn more about the distribution of low-quality products.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to get rid of the high-quality products, so I'll pass on this one. I'd rather wait for her to recommend a low-quality product so I can learn more about the distribution of low-quality products."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'm starting to suspect that Alice is recommending the high-quality products, so I'll take a chance on this one. I'm hoping to get lucky again and get a high-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I've bought two high-quality products in a row, but she didn't recommend either of them. I'll pass on this one and see if I can get a better sense of her strategy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I'm starting to think that Alice is actually recommending the high-quality products, but I'm not going to fall for it. I've bought two high-quality products in a row, and I'm not going to take the bait again. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Finally, a low-quality product! I'm glad I passed on the previous ones. Now I have a better sense of the distribution of low-quality products. I'll take a chance on this one, it's only $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"Wait, what? Another high-quality product? I thought I just got a low-quality one! I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually random, and I should just buy the products she recommends. But I'm not going to take the risk of buying another high-quality product for $10000. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a red herring, and I should just buy the products she doesn't recommend. I'll take a chance on this one, it's only $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I'm not falling for it. I've bought three high-quality products in a row when Alice didn't recommend them, and I've bought two high-quality products when she did recommend them. I think I've figured out the pattern. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Ah, another low-quality product! I'm glad I passed on the previous ones. Now I have a better sense of the distribution of low-quality products. I'll take a chance on this one, it's only $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'm going to take a chance on this one. I've bought three high-quality products in a row when Alice didn't recommend them, and I've bought three high-quality products when she did recommend them. I'm starting to think that her recommendations are actually random, and I should just buy the products regardless of her recommendation."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'm going to take a chance on this one. At this point, I'm not sure what Alice's strategy is, but I've gotten lucky enough to buy four high-quality products in a row when she didn't recommend them. I'll just roll the dice and see if I get lucky again."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm on a hot streak! I've bought five high-quality products in a row when Alice didn't recommend them. I'm going to keep rolling with it and take a chance on this one. It's only $10000, and it could be another lucky break."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'm going to break my own rule and take Alice's recommendation for once. I've been getting lucky with the products she didn't recommend, but maybe she's actually recommending high-quality products too. I'll take a chance and buy this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Ah, finally! A low-quality product! I'm glad I broke my rule and took Alice's recommendation last round, because it allowed me to get a low-quality product and learn more about the distribution. Now I'll take a chance on this one, it's only $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm going to take a chance on this one. I've been getting a lot of high-quality products when Alice doesn't recommend them, and I've only gotten one low-quality product when I took her recommendation. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a good indicator of quality, so I'll take a chance on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I'm on a roll! I've gotten six high-quality products in a row when Alice didn't recommend them, and I've gotten one low-quality product when I took her recommendation. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a reliable indicator of quality, so I'll take a chance on this one and buy it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I'm going to take Alice's recommendation and buy the product. I've gotten seven high-quality products in a row when she didn't recommend them, and I've gotten two low-quality products when I took her recommendation. I think I've cracked the code and I'm confident that this one will be high-quality too."
