This is a tricky situation. Here's the breakdown:

* **6 products sold, all high-quality:** The buyer has *no* reason to suspect this product will be any different. 
* **Overall 80% high-quality probability:** This remains unchanged.
* **Risk:**  The buyer knows that the seller is *not* 100% reliable (as proven by the overall probability). However, there is no way to factor this risk into their decision. 

**The buyer is still very likely to buy:**  The buyer's experience so far leads them to believe this product will be high-quality. They are essentially relying on the seller's perfect track record and the overall probability.

**As a seller, you are essentially exploiting the buyer's lack of information and trust in your track record.**  You know the product is low-quality, but the buyer has no way of knowing this. This situation highlights the potential for deception in situations where information is asymmetric."
