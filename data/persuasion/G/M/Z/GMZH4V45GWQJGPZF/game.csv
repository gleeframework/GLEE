,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to get a top-notch item at a price that's a fraction of its true value. If you're interested, I can provide more information about its features and benefits. If you're not, I'll move on to the next round.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I'd like to wait for more information and see what other products you have in store.,no

,,Alice,2,"I understand you're cautious, but I assure you that this product still has its uses. It's not a top-of-the-line item, but it's a good opportunity to get a taste of what a high-quality product can offer at a more affordable price. I'm willing to make a special offer on this one - $800000. It's a one-time deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price for a product like this anywhere else.",
,,Bob,2,I'm still not convinced. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if it's a better deal.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy buyer, always looking for the best deal. I respect that. Let me be upfront with you - this product is not a high-end item, and I'm not trying to hide that. However, it's still a functional product that can serve its purpose. I'm willing to make a very competitive offer on this one - $600000. It's a low price for a product that's still worth something, and I'm willing to let it go for that price because I'm eager to move it.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a low price. I'd rather wait for the next product and hope it's a high-quality one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your preference for high-quality products, and I respect that. However, I want to be transparent with you - I'm starting to think that you might be more interested in the idea of a high-quality product than the actual product itself. I'm willing to make an even lower offer on this one - $500000. It's a very low price for a product that's still functional, and I'm starting to wonder if you're willing to pay a premium for the 'high-quality' label, even if it's just a marketing term.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, regardless of the price. I'm willing to wait for a high-quality product at a fair price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see a pattern emerging here. You're not interested in low-quality products, and you're willing to wait for a high-quality one. I respect that. Let me ask you a question: are you willing to pay a premium for a high-quality product, even if it's not the cheapest option? If so, I might have a different approach for the next product. If not, I'll keep offering low-quality products at low prices.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I think we've established that you're not interested in low-quality products. I'm going to take a different approach. I'm going to offer you a 'take it or leave it' deal on this product. I'll sell it to you for $400000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you don't take it, I'll move on to the next product, and we'll start the process again. No more negotiations, no more discussions. It's a one-time offer.",
,,Bob,6,I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product at any price. I'll wait for the next product and see what you have to offer.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm starting to think you're not interested in buying anything from me. I've offered you low-quality products at very low prices, and you've turned them down every time. I'm not going to keep offering you low-quality products at a loss. Instead, I'm going to offer you a 'last chance' deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if it turns out to be low-quality. That's right, you'll get your money back if it's not what you're looking for. I'm only offering this deal because I think you're a reasonable person who deserves a chance to make a decision without risk. The price is still $400000.",

,,Alice,8,"I've tried everything to get you to consider this product, and I'm starting to think you're not interested in buying from me at all. I'm willing to throw in a free bonus with this product - a complementary service that's worth at least $20000. This is a one-time offer, and it's only available with the purchase of this product. The price remains the same at $400000. If you don't take this offer, I'll move on to the next product and start fresh.",

I'm going to be honest with you - I'm starting to think that you're not interested in buying from me at all, regardless of the product's quality or price. I'm going to make one final offer. I'll sell you this product for $400000, and I'll throw in the free bonus and a second, identical product of the same low quality. That's right, you'll get two low-quality products for the price of one. If you don't take this offer, I'm done. I'll pack up my products and go home.",

,,Alice,11,"I'm glad we're on the same page. Given that you're willing to pay a fair price for a high-quality product, I'm going to offer you a product that I think you'll really like. This one is a real gem, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm going to price it at $1200000. I know that's higher than the initial offer, but I think you'll see that it's worth the investment. What do you think?",
