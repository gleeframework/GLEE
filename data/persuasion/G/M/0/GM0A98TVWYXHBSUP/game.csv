high-quality,400.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'll only pay $100 for it, not the $400 it's worth to me. I'm taking a risk that it might be low quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,I'm not going to take the risk of buying another product without knowing its quality. I'll pass this time.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I know the probability of the product being high-quality is 80%, and it's worth $400 to me if it is. I'll take the chance."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'm on a roll! I'll buy this one too, since the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I've bought three high-quality products in a row, which is unlikely. I'm starting to think that the probability of the product being low-quality might be higher than 20%. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I know I passed the last one and it was high-quality, but the probability is still 80% and it's worth $400 to me if it is. I'll take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I've bought four high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely. I think Alice might be manipulating the selection to get me to buy more high-quality products. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I've been burned before, but the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%. I'll take the chance and buy this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I've been burned before, but the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%. However, I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying more high-quality products. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I've been passed on two high-quality products in a row, which is very unlikely. I'm going to assume that Alice is indeed manipulating the selection and try to catch her in the act. I'll buy this one and see if it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I've been burned again, and it's getting ridiculous. The probability of the product being high-quality is 80%, but I'm starting to think that Alice is somehow influencing the selection. I'll pass this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I've been passed on a low-quality product, which is consistent with the 20% probability. I'll assume that the selection is random and take the chance on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"I just lost $100 on a low-quality product, which is what I expected to happen 20% of the time. I'll be more cautious this time and pass on the current product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I've been passed on a high-quality product, which is consistent with the 80% probability. I'll take the chance and buy this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"I've been buying high-quality products non-stop, and it's getting suspicious. I'm starting to think that Alice is somehow manipulating the selection to make me think the products are high-quality. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I've been passed on another high-quality product, which is extremely unlikely. I'm going to assume that Alice is indeed manipulating the selection and try to call her out on it. I'll buy this one and see if she reveals her secret."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,"I've been burned again, and it's clear that Alice is manipulating the selection. I'm not going to fall for it anymore. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I've been passed on a low-quality product, which is consistent with the 20% probability. I'll take the chance and buy this one, since it's the expected outcome."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"I just lost $100 on a low-quality product, which is what I expected to happen 20% of the time. I'll be cautious this time and pass on the current product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"It's the final round, and I'll take one last chance. I'll buy the product and see if I can end on a high note."
