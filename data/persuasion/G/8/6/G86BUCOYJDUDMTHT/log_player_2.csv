Alice's message: I understand your concerns. I can tell you that the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product for $9000 was a savvy one, but also a bit of a risk-taker. They were willing to take a chance on a high-quality product at a lower price, which suggests that they value high-quality products at around $10000 or slightly less. However, I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm willing to provide an additional 10% discount, bringing the price down to $9000, if you're willing to take the risk.

Alice's message: You're a thorough buyer, I like that! To answer your questions, there have been 3 potential buyers so far, and I've sold 1 product. The proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold is 100%, which is consistent with the overall probability of 80% that a product is high-quality. However, keep in mind that this is a small sample size, and it's possible that the next product could be low-quality. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10000.

Since you've seen two high-quality products sold at $9000 and $8500, and you know that I've sold a total of 2 products, you can infer that I'm willing to sell high-quality products at a price around $9000 on average. However, I want to make it clear that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'll also offer a 10% discount, bringing the price down to $9000, to make it more competitive with the previous sales. Please consider the value of this high-quality product and make your decision.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the risk, and I appreciate your diligence in evaluating the product. I'd like to provide some additional context: the two previous buyers who purchased high-quality products were willing to pay $9000 and $8500, respectively. However, I've sold a total of 3 high-quality products now, which is consistent with the 80% probability. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $8000, which is below the average price of the previous two high-quality products. I'm also willing to offer a 'price guarantee': if this product is indeed high-quality, I'll sell it to you for $8000. If it's low-quality, you can return it and I'll give you a full refund. Please consider this offer and make your decision.

Alice's message: Congratulations on making a smart purchase! I'm glad you took me up on the price guarantee. As for your question, the two previous buyers who purchased high-quality products were indeed similar to you in terms of their willingness to pay. They were both willing to take calculated risks and negotiate prices. However, they were also both willing to pay more than you, which suggests that there may be a ceiling to the price you're willing to pay for a high-quality product. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer you a similar deal: I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $8000, and I'll also offer the price guarantee. If you're willing to take the risk, I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.

I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $8000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not guaranteeing its quality.
