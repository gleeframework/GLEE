Would you like to take on this'second opinion' for $1000000?""

If you purchase this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a $1,000,000 bonus, just like the 'double or nothing' deal. But here's the twist: if you purchase this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a 50% refund on the purchase price, so you'll only lose $500,000. What do you say?""
