,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"Considering Alice's previous recommendations, it seems that she recommended a high-quality product in Round 1 and didn't recommend a low-quality product in Round 2. I'll take a chance and buy this product, assuming Alice has some knowledge or pattern in her recommendations."
