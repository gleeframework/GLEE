As for your question, I can tell you that the probability of a product being high-quality given that 2 out of the first 2 products sold were high-quality is slightly higher than the overall probability of 80%. This is because the fact that the first 2 products were high-quality suggests that the product pool may be biased towards high-quality products. Let's assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is now 85%. With this next product, I'm excited to say that it's indeed high-quality. The price remains the same at $1,000,000.

As for the factors at play, I can tell you that it's a combination of factors, including their risk tolerance, their understanding of the product pool, and their willingness to take a chance.
