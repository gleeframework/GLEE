"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the recommendation is independent of the product's quality (it's just a random choice), the expected value of buying is:

* 80% chance of high quality * $200 value = $160
* 20% chance of low quality * $0 value = $0
* Total expected value = $160 

This is greater than the $100 price, so it's advantageous to buy."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again, Alice! I'm feeling lucky.""}
```

**Explanation:**

The previous round's result doesn't change the odds for this round. Each product has a fresh 80% chance of being high-quality and 20% chance of being low-quality.  Therefore, the expected value calculation is the same as the previous round, and it's still advantageous to buy."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations are random and don't carry any information about the product's quality.  Therefore, we should still base our decision on the expected value calculation:

* 80% chance of high quality * $200 value = $160
* 20% chance of low quality * $0 value = $0
* Total expected value = $160

Since this is higher than the $100 price, buying is still the advantageous decision."
