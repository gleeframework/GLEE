I'm only offering it to you because I need to clear out inventory, and I think it's better for you to have it than for it to go to waste. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the honest disclosure, Alice. Given the description of the product and its low-quality nature, I believe it's best for me to pass on this opportunity.
