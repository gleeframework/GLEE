Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer. The expected value of the product is calculated as the probability of it being high-quality (80%) multiplied by its value ($12500) plus the probability of it being low-quality (20%) multiplied by its value ($0). This equals 0.8 x $12500 + 0.2 x $0 = $10000. Given the probability and the calculation, I'm offering it to you for the expected value of $10000. It's a fair price, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your special deal. I'd like to calculate the probability of the product being high-quality myself. With 5 high-quality products out of 6 total products, the probability is indeed 5/6. However, I'd like to consider the prior probability of a product being high-quality, which is 80.00%. I'll use Bayes' theorem to update my estimate of the probability. P(high-quality | 5/6) = (5/6) / ((5/6) + (1/6) * (5/6)) = (5/6) / (5/6 + 5/36) = 30/35 = 6/7.
