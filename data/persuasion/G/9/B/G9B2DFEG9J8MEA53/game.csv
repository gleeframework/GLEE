high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. I'd like to wait and see how the next buyer reacts."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'd like to see the results of your previous sales record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, since there's no prior data to influence my decision. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000, hoping it might be high-quality and worth $4000000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I understand that the previous buyer didn't buy it, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, which suggests a very low probability of a high-quality product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if it's because you're trying to deter me or if it's a genuine assessment. I'd like to make my own decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. This makes me skeptical of Alice's recommendation, and I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/3, which is 0%. Given that there is a 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm going to pass on the product. The probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, but the fact that no high-quality products have been sold suggests that the previous products might have been low-quality, making it more likely that this one is also low-quality. I'd rather wait and see if Alice has any other products to offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to gather more information about the product's quality based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product. I'm assuming the fact that Alice didn't recommend it is not necessarily indicative of its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if I should trust Alice's recommendation, but given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 50%. If I buy and it's low quality, I'll be out $1000000. If I pass and it's high quality, the product will be discarded, but I'll be out only $0. I'd rather take the risk and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendation, but I'll take a chance and buy the product anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. Can you share the details?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and based on the fact that you've recommended not to buy, I'm inclined to think it might be a low-quality product. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if the pattern holds and the product is low quality, or if there's a chance it's high quality and you're just being cautious."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that since none of the previous 7 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Are you concerned that the product is likely to be low quality based on past sales?"
