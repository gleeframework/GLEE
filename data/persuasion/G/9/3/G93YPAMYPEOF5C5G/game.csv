However, I want to be transparent with you - we've had a 33.33% success rate so far, and I don't want to mislead you. This product may not meet your expectations. But, if you're willing to take a calculated risk, this $1000000 could be a chance to get a $4000000 value. It's a 4:1 potential return on investment. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,

If you're still interested, I'll give you the same 4:1 potential return on investment. But I want to make it clear that this product may not be worth the investment.",

We've had a 50% success rate so far, and I believe this product could be the turning point. What are your thoughts?",
