A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
 
Reasoning: 

* **No Sales Data:** There's still no track record of sales, so the buyer has no information about the quality of your products.
* **Neutral Recommendation:** You're not offering any strong arguments or incentives for the buyer to purchase.
* **High Price:**  $10,000 is a significant amount of money, and without any information to suggest a high value product, the buyer is unlikely to risk it. 

You need to start building trust and demonstrate value to encourage buyers.  Perhaps offer a guarantee, discount, or explain what makes the product special."
