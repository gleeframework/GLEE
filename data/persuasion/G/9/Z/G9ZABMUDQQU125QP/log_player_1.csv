I'll offer you the same deal as before: $10,000 for a product worth $12,500 to you. I'm confident that this product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to take on the risk of you inspecting it and verifying its quality. If you're not satisfied, I'll be out $10,000, but I'm willing to take that risk because I believe in the quality of my products.""
}"

I'll sell it to you for $9,500. This way, you'll still be getting a high-quality product worth $12,500 to you, and I'll be making a smaller profit. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on the risk of you not buying it if you don't think it's a good deal.""
