high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.

high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,

high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous buyer also received a recommendation to buy and didn't purchase, which might indicate a higher likelihood of the product being low-quality."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record?

high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80.00%). This suggests that the product I'm being offered might be more likely to be low-quality than high-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."
