,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one.

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, and the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics."
