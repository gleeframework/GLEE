"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable piece of information. Since she knows the value of each product to you, her ""not recommended"" signal strongly suggests the product is likely low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of it being low quality and thus worthless, it's a safer bet to pass in this round."

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'm confident in your judgment and will buy this product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation has now flipped. Since she knows the product's value to you, her recommendation strongly suggests the product is likely high-quality. Given the potential for a $120 gain, it's a much better risk to take compared to the previous round."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is consistent with the previous round. Even though you made a profit on the last purchase, her ""not recommended"" signal should be respected.  The 66.67% chance of a low-quality product outweighs the potential $20 profit. It's better to play it safe and pass."
