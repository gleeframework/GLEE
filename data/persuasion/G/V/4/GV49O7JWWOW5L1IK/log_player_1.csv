Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""I understand you're skeptical. Let me be transparent with you. The previous buyer was offered the product for $1,000,000, and they decided to take the risk. They were aware of the 66.67% chance it was a low-quality product, but they thought the potential upside was worth it. I'm not trying to hide anything from you. This product, however, is a different one. I'm offering it to you for the same price of $1,000,000. It's a one-time opportunity to take a chance on a potentially valuable item. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you. If not, I'll just keep it for myself.""}"

I want to be upfront with you - the previous buyer who passed on the product didn't know the outcome of the first sale, and I think that might have influenced their decision. Now that you have more information, I'll let you in on a secret: the first product was a low-quality one, and the second product is the high-quality one you know about. I'm offering you this 4th product for $1,000,000. It's a risk, but I think it's worth considering.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned that the fact that you're offering me this information might be influencing my decision.

It's a bit of a long shot, but it's a chance to potentially get a high-quality product for a low price.""}"

The numbers don't lie, and the probability of a high-quality product has decreased slightly.
