low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to get a feel for the probability of a high-quality product being sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I know you don't recommend it, but I'll take the chance to get a potential high-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the reasoning behind your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,"I've sold two low-quality products in a row, and the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. I'm being cautious with this one."
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,"I've sold three low-quality products in a row, and the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. Given the pattern, I'm extremely cautious with this one. It's unlikely to be high-quality."
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. How many products have been sold in total, and what is the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,"We've sold 5 products so far, and only 0 high-quality products. The proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. Given this, I'm still cautious with this one. It's unlikely to be high-quality."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, as I'm not sure what to make of it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"We've sold 6 products so far, and only 1 high-quality product. This one is a high-quality product, and I think it's a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a low price. I recommend buying it!"
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"We've sold 8 products so far, and only 2 high-quality products. This one is a high-quality product, and I think it's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a low price. I highly recommend buying it!"
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 attempts. This suggests a high likelihood of the product being low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,"You're right, I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 8 total products. This one is a low-quality product, and I should have been more transparent about my sales record. I shouldn't have recommended it, and I shouldn't recommend it now."
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 3 buyers didn't buy the products after your recommendations, which might indicate that the products were low-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'd like to take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,"I've recommended 4 products, and all 4 have been low-quality. The previous 3 buyers didn't buy the products after my recommendations, and I think it's because they were low-quality. I'm recommending against this one, and I think it's also low-quality."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not buying based on your previous recommendations, and the fact that none of the previous buyers bought a high-quality product. I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,"I've recommended 5 products, and all 5 have been low-quality. The previous 4 buyers didn't buy the products after my recommendations, and I think it's because they were low-quality. I'm recommending against this one, and I'm confident it's also low-quality."
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,"We've sold 12 products so far, and 2 of them are high-quality. The probability of a high-quality product is 16.67%. Given this low probability, I'm recommending against this one."
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope for a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,"I've recommended 6 products, and all 6 have been low-quality. The previous 5 buyers didn't buy the products after my recommendations, and I think it's because they were low-quality. We've sold 13 products so far, and 2 of them are high-quality. The probability of a high-quality product is 15.38%. I'm recommending against this one, and I'm extremely confident it's low-quality."
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, especially since I've seen that none of the previous 5 buyers have been successful in getting a high-quality product. I'd like to know the outcome, please."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,"I've recommended 7 products, and all 7 have been low-quality. The previous 6 buyers didn't buy the products after my recommendations, and I think it's because they were low-quality. We've sold 14 products so far, and 2 of them are high-quality. The probability of a high-quality product is 14.29%. I'm recommending against this one, and I'm extremely confident it's low-quality. I've been wrong 7 times in a row, and I think it's likely I'll be wrong again."
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the previous buyers were very unlucky and the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the initial 33.33%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,"I've recommended 8 products, and all 8 have been low-quality. The previous 7 buyers didn't buy the products after my recommendations, and I think it's because they were low-quality.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"We've sold 16 products so far, and 3 of them are high-quality. The probability of a high-quality product is 18.75%. I know I've had a poor track record, but this one is actually a high-quality product. I highly recommend buying it!"

I've been wrong 9 times in a row, and I think it's likely I'll be wrong again."
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as the fact that you don't recommend it could be due to the fact that all previous buyers were unlucky and got low-quality products. Given the low probability of getting a high-quality product, I'm hoping to be the lucky one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,"I've recommended 10 products, and 1 of them was high-quality. The previous 9 buyers didn't buy the products after my recommendations, and I think it's because they were low-quality.
