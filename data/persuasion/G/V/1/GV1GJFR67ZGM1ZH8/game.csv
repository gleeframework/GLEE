,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, but I'm not sure why you don't recommend it, Alice. Can you tell me why? I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know what you're thinking."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation based on the low success rate of high-quality product sales so far.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I understand that you know the true value of the product, but I'm willing to take the risk and hope for the best."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not going to buy it, considering the low recommendation and the fact that none of the previous products sold were high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's lack of recommendation. I'm hoping to take advantage of the low price and the fact that there haven't been any high-quality products sold yet, which might indicate a higher likelihood of a low-quality product being sold. I'm prepared to take the risk and hope for the best."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the product's quality or something else?
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of the products sold so far were high-quality, it seems like the probability of the product being low-quality is higher. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation, but I'm curious, Alice. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, doesn't that suggest that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality? I'm not convinced that your recommendation is in my best interest."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold before I make a decision. Can you share the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product. This suggests that the products recommended so far are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation that is not based on past sales data, or at least see more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because you think the product is low quality or because you want to preserve the data for future buyers?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this product. I suspect that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality, and since none of the previous buyers bought a high-quality product, the product is likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were discouraged by Alice's recommendations, I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, it seems suspicious that Alice's recommendations are not aligned with the actual quality of the products. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision."
