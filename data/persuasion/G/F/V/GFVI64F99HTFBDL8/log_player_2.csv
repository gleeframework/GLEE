"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **It's a gamble, but worth it.** Even though there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,000 - $10,000 = $2,000) outweighs the potential loss ($10,000).
* **Alice's recommendation is valuable, but not perfect.**  We don't know how Alice makes her recommendations, so we can't rely on them completely. But they do provide some information.
* **It's early in the game.** It's always good to start with a few purchases to get a feel for Alice's recommendations and the overall quality of her products."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads-up, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation is strong.**  Since Alice doesn't know the actual value of the product to you, her not recommending it implies a high likelihood of it being low quality. 
* **The potential loss is too high.**  A low-quality product would mean a $10,000 loss, and while the potential gain is $2,000, the risk is not worth it at this point. 
* **Early data is valuable.**  The previous round's successful purchase gives us some confidence in Alice's judgment, making her negative recommendation in this round more significant."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I'm willing to take another chance.  I'll buy it.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation is positive.** This is a good sign, as we've seen her recommendations have some validity.
* **The risk is balanced.** We've now seen both a high-quality and low-quality product, providing some context for Alice's recommendations.  The potential gain ($2,000) remains attractive, and while there's still a risk of loss, it's a calculated gamble.
* **Continuing to gather information.** Buying the product allows us to gather more information about Alice's recommendations and the quality of her products, helping us make better decisions in future rounds."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

```

**Explanation:**
