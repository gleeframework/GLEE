"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As the seller, you are incentivized to sell regardless of the product's quality. Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, there's a chance of getting a good deal. Additionally, there's no information about the buyer's valuation of high or low-quality products. 

Therefore, it's reasonable to recommend the buyer to purchase the product. It's a gamble, but with a potential for a significant profit."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record and a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass on this one.

Round 2

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The seller has no incentive to reveal the quality of the product. Since the buyer has no information about the product's quality and the seller's record remains empty, the seller should still recommend the purchase. The buyer is aware of the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, but the seller's lack of a sales record doesn't offer any additional information for the buyer to make a more informed decision."
"The buyer's message: Since there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, which is worth $0 to me, and only a 33.33% chance of it being high quality, the expected value of buying the product is less than the price of $1000000. I'll pass on this one.

```

Therefore, the seller should continue recommending the purchase, hoping the buyer takes the risk."
