high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the previous buyers may have been low-quality products. This suggests that the probability of the current product being low-quality may be higher than 20%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation, as she has recommended two products that turned out to be low quality so far."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the products after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products that were recommended were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a product that hasn't been recommended by you yet."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
