"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, you know the product is high-quality.  While you don't know Bob's exact valuation, there's a chance he values it higher than the $100 price.  Since there's a potential for a positive outcome (Bob values it higher and buys), recommending the purchase is the best strategy."

Round 2

Even though Bob bought the previous two high-quality products, you now know this one is low-quality.  You don't know Bob's valuation for a low-quality product, but it's likely lower than $100.  Recommending the purchase would be risky, as there's a high chance Bob will be unhappy and might not buy from you in the future. It's better to err on the side of caution and not recommend the purchase."
