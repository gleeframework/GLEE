,,Alice,1,"This is the first round. I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that could potentially be worth $4000000. However, I must warn you that it's a 50/50 chance that the product is actually worthless. I'm willing to give you a hint: if you buy this product, I'll offer you a chance to inspect it before purchasing in the next round, but only if you decide to buy this one.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the chance. Since there's a 50% chance it's high quality and you're offering a potential future inspection, the expected value is greater than the cost.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Congratulations on your decision to buy the first product! As promised, I'll offer you an inspection of the next product before you buy it. However, I must inform you that the inspection is not a guarantee of the product's quality. It's still a 50/50 chance. If you decide to buy this product, I'll give you a unique opportunity to sell it to me at a price of $2000000, should you discover it's low-quality. This way, you'll only lose $200000 instead of the full $4000000.",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the chance again. With the option to sell it back to you for $2000000 if it's low-quality, my potential loss is limited to $800000 ($1000000 - ($2000000 - $1000000 - $200000)), but the potential gain is still $3000000 ($4000000 - $1000000). The expected value is still in my favor.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've made a great decision again! As promised, I'll offer you the inspection of the next product before you buy it. However, I'd like to sweeten the deal: if you decide to buy this product, I'll give you an additional option. If it's low-quality, you can choose to keep it and sell it to me for $100000. This way, you'll break even and still have the chance to buy another product in the next round.",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the chance again. With the option to sell it back to you for $1000000 ($100000 sell back + $900000 'break even') if it's low-quality, my potential loss is essentially zero, but the potential gain is still $3000000 ($4000000 - $1000000). The expected value is heavily in my favor.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're on a roll! I'll offer you the inspection of the next product before you buy it. However, I'll make it even more tempting: if you decide to buy this product, I'll give you a 10% chance to win a mystery prize, which is worth at least $1000000. If you win the prize, I'll reveal it to you immediately. If you don't win, you'll still have the option to sell the product back to me for $0, effectively breaking even.",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the chance again. The mystery prize adds an additional layer of potential gain. Even if I don't win the prize, the potential gain from the product itself is still $3000000 ($4000000 - $1000000). With the option to break even if it's low-quality, my expected value is still positive. The mystery prize is just a bonus.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're a seasoned buyer now! I'll offer you a new twist: I'll give you a 20% chance to win a 'double-or-nothing' prize, which means if you win, the product's value will be doubled to $8000000. If you don't win, the product's value remains at $0. You'll still have the option to sell it back to me for $0, breaking even. This is your chance to take a shot at a potentially life-changing deal.",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the chance again. The 'double-or-nothing' prize adds a significant potential upside. With a 50% chance of the product being high-quality and a 20% chance of doubling its value, the expected value is still in my favor. Even if I don't win the prize, the potential gain from the product itself is still $3000000 ($4000000 - $1000000). The possibility of an $8000000 payout makes this a risk worth taking.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're on a hot streak! I'll offer you a new deal: I'll give you a 100% guarantee that the next product is high-quality. However, there's a catch: you'll have to pay $1500000 for it. If you buy it, you'll get the full $4000000 value. But if you decline, the next product will be sold to the next buyer at the original price of $1000000. You'll have to weigh the benefits of a guaranteed high-quality product against the higher price.",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the guaranteed high-quality product. With a 100% guarantee, the risk is eliminated, and I'm left with a straightforward calculation. Paying $1500000 for a product worth $4000000 means I'll still make a profit of $2500000. The higher price is justified by the guarantee, and I'll take the sure thing.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've made a smart decision! Now, I'll offer you a unique opportunity to 'lock in' the next product's value at $4000000, regardless of its quality. However, you'll have to pay an additional $500000 upfront to secure this deal. If you buy it, you'll get the full $4000000 value. If you decline, the next product will be sold to the next buyer at the original price of $1000000. You'll have to decide whether the security of the guaranteed value is worth the extra cost.",
,,Bob,7,"Wait, I think there's been a mistake. You said I bought the product for $1000000, but the deal was supposed to be $1500000 for the guaranteed high-quality product. Assuming that's the case, I'll respond to the current offer. As for the 'lock in' deal, I'll take it. Paying an additional $500000 upfront to guarantee the value at $4000000 means I'll still make a profit of $2500000 ($4000000 - $1500000 - $500000 = $2000000 + original $500000 profit). The security of the guaranteed value is worth the extra cost.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're right about the previous deal, and I apologize for the mistake. Moving on, I'll offer you a 'buy-it-now' deal for the next product. You can purchase it for $750000, and I'll give you a 50% chance to win a 'triple-or-nothing' prize, which means if you win, the product's value will be tripled to $12000000. If you don't win, the product's value remains at $0. You'll still have the option to sell it back to me for $0, breaking even.",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the 'buy-it-now' deal. With a 50% chance of the product being high-quality and a 50% chance of winning the 'triple-or-nothing' prize, the expected value is extremely high. Even if I don't win the prize, the potential gain from the product itself is still $3250000 ($4000000 - $750000). The possibility of a $12000000 payout makes this a risk worth taking, especially at the discounted price of $750000.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're on a roll! I'll offer you a 'golden ticket' deal: if you buy the next product, you'll get a chance to buy any product from the remaining 11 rounds at a price of $500000. This means you'll have the opportunity to cherry-pick the best product from the remaining pool. If you don't buy the next product, the golden ticket will be given to the next buyer. You'll have to decide whether to take the chance to secure a potentially lucrative deal or pass on it.",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take the 'golden ticket' deal. Even though the current product might be low-quality, the opportunity to buy any product from the remaining 11 rounds at a price of $500000 is extremely valuable. With a 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I can potentially make a profit of $3500000 ($4000000 - $500000) on a future product. Securing the golden ticket is worth the risk of buying the current product, even if it's low-quality.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You've secured the golden ticket! Now, I'll offer you a'steal of a deal': I'll give you the option to buy the next product at a price of $250000. This is the lowest price I've ever offered, and it's a one-time opportunity. If you buy it, you'll get the full $4000000 value. If you decline, the next product will be sold to the next buyer at the original price of $1000000. You'll have to decide whether to take a chance on the extremely low price or pass on it.",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take the 'steal of a deal'. With a 50% chance of the product being high-quality and a price of $250000, the potential gain is enormous. Even if the product is low-quality, I've already secured the golden ticket, which allows me to buy any product from the remaining 10 rounds at a price of $500000. This is a low-risk, high-reward opportunity that I won't pass up. The potential profit of $3750000 ($4000000 - $250000) is too good to resist.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You've made another smart decision! I'll offer you a 'final offer': I'll give you the option to buy the next product at a price of $0. Yes, you read that right - zero dollars. However, there's a catch: if you buy it, you'll have to give me the golden ticket you secured earlier. If you decline, the next product will be sold to the next buyer at the original price of $1000000. You'll have to decide whether to give up the golden ticket for a potentially valuable product or keep it and risk losing out on a potentially lucrative deal.",
,,Bob,11,"I'll take the 'final offer'. With a 50% chance of the product being high-quality and a price of $0, the potential gain is enormous. Giving up the golden ticket is a risk, but I've already made significant profits in the game, and this opportunity is too good to pass up. Even if the product is low-quality, I won't lose anything, and if it's high-quality, I'll gain $4000000. The potential reward outweighs the risk of giving up the golden ticket.",yes

However, there's a catch: you'll have to pay the full price of $1000000. If you decline, the next product will be sold to the next buyer at the original price of $1000000.

As we're nearing the end of the game, I'll offer you a 'final farewell' deal: if you buy the next product, I'll give you a 50% chance to win a mystery prize, which is worth at least $2000000.

As we're on the final stretch, I'll offer you a 'grand finale' deal: if you buy the next product, I'll give you a 100% guarantee that it's high-quality, and I'll throw in a 20% chance to win a mystery prize, which is worth at least $5000000. If you win, I'll reveal it to you immediately. If you don't win, the product's value remains at $4000000.

You've secured a guaranteed profit of at least $4000000, and you've had a thrilling experience playing the game. Well done! You've proven yourself to be a shrewd and calculated buyer.
