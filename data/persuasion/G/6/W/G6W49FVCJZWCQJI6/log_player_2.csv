Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I'm going to pass on this one.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is incentivized to recommend the product if it is high-quality, and she has chosen not to.  Therefore, it is more likely that the product is low quality.  Even though there is still a chance it is high-quality, it's not worth the risk of losing $1,000,000."
