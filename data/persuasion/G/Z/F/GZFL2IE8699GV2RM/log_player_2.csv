"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

While there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product is double the cost.  It's a calculated risk with a positive expected value in the long run. This strategy is based on the assumption that Alice's recommendations are not deliberately trying to mislead you."

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty in not recommending this product. I'll pass for now.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's lack of recommendation suggests the product is likely low quality.  Since there's no way to know for sure without risking $1,000,000, it's best to pass and wait for a better opportunity."

```
