Alice's message: Welcome! I'm excited to offer you this product for $10000. As a reputable seller, I want to assure you that I stand behind the quality of my products. While I don't disclose the quality of individual products, I can tell you that 33.33% of my products are high-quality, and I'm confident that you'll find this one to be a valuable addition to your collection. Will you take the chance?

Since there's no sales history, I don't have any data to base my decision on.  Could you possibly offer a discount or a money-back guarantee to incentivize a purchase?  Or perhaps allow me to inspect the product before buying?""}
