low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm not basing my decision on your recommendation, but rather on the probability of the product being high quality, which is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics so far. With 1 buyer and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high quality might be low."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying, I will pass on this product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one buyer having purchased a product so far and no high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if I can get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you don't recommend it, I'll take a closer look at the statistics. Since 1 out of 1 buyer passed on the product, and 0 high-quality products have been sold, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm skeptical of your recommendation and want to see if it's high quality, not because I trust your assessment."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, because you've recommended 2 products and neither of them were high-quality, so I'm skeptical of your recommendation and will make my own decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product. Is it because you think it's low-quality based on the statistics?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that Alice's recommendations have been poor so far. I'm hoping to exploit the information that she has and I don't. Given the low quality of the products sold so far, I'm assuming that the probability of the product being high quality is higher than 33.33%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers bought the product after your recommendation, I'm going to assume that all of them received low-quality products and Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator that this product is also low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that the products recommended to buy so far are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product, which might indicate a higher chance of it being high-quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 out of 4 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 4 previous sales and no high-quality products sold, I'm suspicious that the products sold were all low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know why you're recommending me not to buy the product, Alice. Is it because of the low sales record of high-quality products so far?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products and were recommended to buy, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'll wait for a change in the trend before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far, and the number of products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which might indicate a bias towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait and see if Alice's recommendations change as more buyers purchase products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, and I'm willing to take that risk."
