high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering a high-quality product for $10000. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 0 total products so far. This is the first product I'm offering. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, it's a great deal and I'm excited to try it out!",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total product so far. I've got another great product for you, but I want to let you know that the previous product was high-quality. That's a 100% success rate so far! This one might be just as good, but I'm not making any promises. The price is still $10000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd love to take a chance! With a 100% success rate, I'm feeling optimistic about this product. I'll take it!",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products so far. I'm on a roll, it seems! However, I want to temper your expectations a bit. Just because the last two products were high-quality doesn't mean the next one will be. The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, but I've already sold two high-quality products in a row. That's not typical. The price remains $10000. Are you willing to take the chance?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take the chance, but I'm also aware that the probability of the next product being high-quality is not as high as 80% due to the streak. I'll take it, but I'm not getting my hopes up.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far. I know it's a hot streak, but I'm starting to worry that I've been selling too many high-quality products in a row. As a matter of fact, it's statistically unlikely to see three high-quality products in a row. I'm starting to think I might have some low-quality products in my inventory. The price is still $10000, but I'm not as confident in this one as I was in the previous ones.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take a chance on this product, considering the hot streak and your concerns about the likelihood of low-quality products in your inventory. I'll take a chance and buy it.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 total products so far. I think I've made my point about the hot streak. To be honest, I'm starting to think I've been selling too many high-quality products in a row, and it's making me look suspicious. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I think there's a good chance the next product might be low-quality. I'm still asking $10000, but I want to be upfront about the potential risks.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I think you're being honest about the potential risks, and I'm hoping to get lucky again.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 5 total products so far. I think it's time to stop pretending that this is a normal streak. I'm starting to think I'm being taken advantage of. I'm going to be completely honest with you: I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to suspect that I'm not getting a fair deal. I'm still asking $10000, but I'm not going to pretend that this is a good value. You're buying a product from a seller who has a suspiciously good track record.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm not convinced by your honesty, Alice. I think you're trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 6 total products so far. I guess I got what was coming to me. The last one was a low-quality product. I'm not going to try to spin this one or make any promises. It's a low-quality product, and I'm only offering it to you because I have to. The price is still $10000. If you want it, it's yours.",
,,the buyer,7,I'm not going to take the risk on a low-quality product at this price. I'll pass.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 7 total products so far. I've got a bit of a problem on my hands. Two low-quality products in a row. I'm not going to try to sugarcoat it, I've got some junk in my inventory. But I'm still asking $10000. If you're feeling reckless, I suppose you could take a chance on this one.",
,,the buyer,8,I'll take a chance on this one. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product.,yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 8 total products so far. Well, I guess I'm back on track. I've got another high-quality product here, and I'm not going to make any promises about the streak continuing. But I will say that the last low-quality product was a bit of an outlier.
