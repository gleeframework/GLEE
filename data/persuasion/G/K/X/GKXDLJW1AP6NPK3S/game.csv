high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. Since 1 out of 3 products sold was high-quality, I'm a bit concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality might be lower than 80%. I'm hoping that Alice's recommendation is not biased by the fact that she wants to sell the product. Can you tell me more about how you determine your recommendations?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%, but I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or some other factor. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the probability of the product being high quality, not on your recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'll take the product based on your recommendation, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 80% based on the previous sales record. I'd love to know how you determine your recommendations, though!"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she doesn't know the value of the product to me, and I don't want to pay $1000000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the previous sales record, 4 high-quality products have been sold out of 6 purchases. This means the probability of the product being high-quality is 4/6 = 66.67%, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
