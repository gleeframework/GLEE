low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the probability that the product is high-quality based on your previous sales record."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the previous buyer didn't buy, which might be due to the product being low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see the outcome for myself and update my understanding of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's lack of recommendation, which makes me think the product is more likely to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the probability of it being high quality, not Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the sales record. How many potential buyers have there been so far, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm the 5th buyer and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, not because of your recommendation."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 products were high quality, I think the probability of this product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, but I believe the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 33.33%. I'd like to take the chance."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 6 buyers have been recommended to buy, and none of them found a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is likely lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, the probability of this product being high-quality seems low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 previous buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than expected. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at a high price."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'll pass on this one. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the previous sales record."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable since 0 high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 buyers have already passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product has decreased. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
