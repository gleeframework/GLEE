high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product as the first buyer, since there's no prior data to go by. I'm hoping for a high-quality product!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice is willing to sell it to me at the original price of $100. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product, and I'm hoping for a high-quality one. If not, I'll pass and let you decide what to do with it."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 2, which is 0%. This is below the expected probability of 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality based on your previous recommendations, but given the low success rate, I'd rather pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next buyer is more willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't want to be the first one to buy a product from Alice after 2 failed purchases. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry to my advantage."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows 4 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products being sold, and I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data, please."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high quality, but based on the previous sales record, I notice that no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the 33.33% probability. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping for a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it, which makes me suspicious that it might be low-quality. I'm hoping to get a better deal than the previous 5 buyers, who all chose to buy despite your recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, but I've seen that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality. I'll pass on this one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the same price of $100. I'm taking a risk based on the fact that you're not recommending it, which suggests there's a higher chance it's low quality, but I'm willing to take that risk if it means I get to buy it at the discounted price."
