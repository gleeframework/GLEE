Round 6
Alice's message: I'm glad you're happy with your previous purchases! However, I want to be transparent with you about this next product. Given that you've already bought two high-quality products, I think it's only fair to offer you a different kind of deal. This product is not high-quality, but I'm willing to let you have it for a significantly reduced price of $2000. This way, you can still get a good deal on a product, even if it's not worth as much to you. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at the original price of $10,000.""}"

If you buy this low-quality product, I'll not only give you the $1000 gift card, but I'll also throw in a $2000 cash refund.
