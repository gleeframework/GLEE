low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold one high-quality product already, and I have 19 more to go. This one might not be as good as the last one, but it's still a chance to get a product from me. The price is still $100, a fair deal considering the odds of getting a high-quality product from me are 1 in 3.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 attempts, which is clearly not possible. I must have been selling a lot of low-quality products so far. You can't trust my previous sales record. This product is probably low-quality too. But hey, it's only $100, so it's a low-risk, low-reward gamble.",
,,the buyer,4,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product based on your recommendation.,yes

,,Alice,5,"I've been completely honest with you so far. I've sold 4 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products.

It's still only $100, and you might be getting a good deal.",
