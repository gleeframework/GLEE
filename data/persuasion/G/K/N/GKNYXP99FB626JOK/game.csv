,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, since I have no prior information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low probability of a high-quality product is still in my favor."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0/2 ratio of high-quality to low-quality products sold, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. How many potential buyers were there before me, and how many products were sold before I got this offer?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and considering the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, I'm inclined to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous buyers bought the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low quality. Additionally, with 66.67% chance of being low quality, it's not worth the risk of buying it for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. However, the fact that all previous buyers have bought the product despite the low probability of it being high quality suggests that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer will make a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'll pass on this one. I'd like to know the statistics of the previous buyers' purchases, especially the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations. If 3 out of 3 products were low quality, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%."
