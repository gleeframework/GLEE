  ""message"": ""You are considering purchasing a product from a seller with a 50% chance of selling high-quality products.

I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1,000,000. If you buy it, you'll be my second customer, and you'll have a chance to beat the odds.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the odds are against you having a high-quality product, not because I think the product is worth $1000000 to me. I'm hoping to take advantage of the apparent anomaly in your sales record.

This product is definitely not worth $1,000,000 to me, and I'm only selling it to you because I need to clear out inventory.""

  ""message"": ""I've sold 3 products so far, with 2 of them being high-quality. The first two products were high-quality, and the third one is actually low-quality. This is a good opportunity to buy a product at a potentially discounted price, since the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%.

It seems like I've had a streak of bad luck. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $1,000,000, but I'll give you a hint: I have a lot of low-quality products left in my inventory. If you buy this one, you'll be helping me clear out some of the inventory and potentially making a good deal for yourself.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one. Given the high proportion of high-quality products in the first two sales, I'm concerned that the streak of bad luck might be a coincidence, and the remaining products might still have a higher chance of being high-quality.

}"
