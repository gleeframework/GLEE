Alice's message: Welcome! I've sold 1 product so far, and it's clear that my previous sale was a fluke. I have a large inventory of products, and I'm confident that the next one will be a high-quality one. In fact, the probability of this product being high-quality is much higher than the previous one. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000, which is a steal considering the odds are now in your favor.

This is a 50% success rate, which is actually lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). I'm offering this product to you for $10000, and I'm willing to provide a guarantee: if you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll offer you another product of your choice from my inventory at the same price.

This is a 66.7% success rate, which is higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the refund policy. I'd like to clarify that the refund process is straightforward: if you buy this product and it's deemed low-quality, I'll provide a full refund within 3 business days. To initiate the refund, you'll need to contact me with proof of the product's low quality, such as a photo or video of the product's condition.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the Bayesian calculation. The prior probability of a product being high-quality is 0.8, which is based on the overall probability of a product being high-quality. The likelihood function is a binomial distribution, where the number of successes (high-quality products) is 5, the number of trials (total products sold) is 10, and the probability of success is 0.8. The posterior distribution is a beta distribution with parameters α = 5 + 1 = 6 and β = 5 + 1 = 6. I've calculated the mean and standard deviation of the posterior distribution, which are approximately 0.61 and 0.12, respectively. I'm offering this product to you for $10000, and I'll reiterate that it's a low-quality product.
