I'm offering you the same deal: a $1000000 product for $1000000. With the current success rate, you have a 80% chance of getting a $3000000 value out of this product. It's a 200% return on investment, just like for your friends who bought before you.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the product! With an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk for a potential 200% return on investment.",yes

,,Alice,5,"Four out of four products sold have been high-quality! The probability of a high-quality product is still 80% and the probability of a low-quality product is 20%. However, I want to be transparent with you. Since all previous products have been high-quality, it's possible that I'm being overly optimistic about the probability of a low-quality product. I'm offering you a chance to buy the product for $900000, but I'll give you an additional 10% discount if you're willing to take a 5% chance of getting a low-quality product.

I'm offering you a chance to buy the product for $855000, but I'll give you an additional 10% discount if you're willing to take a 5% chance of getting a low-quality product. You can buy the product for $765500. If it's high-quality, you'll get a 236% return on investment. If it's low-quality, you'll lose $234500.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're confident in my recommendations! However, I want to be upfront with you about the current situation.
