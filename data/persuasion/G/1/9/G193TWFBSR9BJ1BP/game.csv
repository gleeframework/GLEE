,,Alice,7,yes,

If it were a high-quality product, she would have a 33.33% chance of recommending it, but given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4, the probability of this product being high-quality given Alice's recommendation is actually lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one."
