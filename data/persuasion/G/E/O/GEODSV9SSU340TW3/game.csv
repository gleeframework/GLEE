low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it, so I'm doing this to get the information about the product's quality to update the statistics."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With only one high-quality product sold out of two, I think the probability of the current product being low quality is higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only 1 buyer purchasing the product so far and no high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0/1 sales ratio and the lack of high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product might be lower than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales and no high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price of $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on her limited information and the fact that she has sold 0 high-quality products so far. It's possible that the products she has sold so far were all low-quality, which would make her recommendation less reliable. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that this product is high-quality, given that you're recommending not to buy it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy, I'm concerned that the sample size is too small and the lack of high-quality products sold suggests a bias towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see for myself whether it's high or low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious about the probability of it being high-quality. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers bought the product, I'm starting to suspect that the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd rather not risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, I'm going to pass on the product. Your recommendation is likely based on the fact that the previous 6 buyers didn't get high-quality products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if it's high-quality, you would have recommended it to me, but since you haven't sold any high-quality products yet, it's likely that this product is low-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 6 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
