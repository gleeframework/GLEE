Round 2
Alice's message: I've been in the industry for a while, and I've seen some... interesting products come through. This one's a bit of a wild card. The price is still $1000000, but I'm willing to let you know that it's not a top-of-the-line item. It's still a great opportunity to take a chance on something that could potentially be a hidden gem.

Round 3
Alice's message: I've got to be honest with you, Bob. This one's a bit of a long shot. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, but it's not the best product I've got in stock. The price remains $1000000, but I'm willing to throw in a guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied, I'll give you a full refund. It's a risk, but it's a risk with a safety net.

Round 5
Alice's message: I'm glad you found the information helpful, Bob! This product is a great example of what I'm offering.

Normally, this product would be priced at $1200000, but I'm willing to make an exception for you. The price remains $1000000, and I think it's a steal.

Round 7
Alice's message: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Bob! However, I want to be upfront with you again - this product is not one of my top recommendations. I've already offered you a solid deal on the previous one, and I'm not going to push this one as hard. The price remains $1000000, but I'm willing to throw in a'make-good' deal: if you buy this product and don't like it, I'll give you a chance to swap it out for a high-quality product from my next batch.
