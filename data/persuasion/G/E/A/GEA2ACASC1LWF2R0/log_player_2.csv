"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you have no information about the product's quality yet, and Alice is recommending it, it's reasonable to assume the product is likely of high quality.  Given the 80% chance of high quality, it's a gamble worth taking, as the potential payoff of $12,500 outweighs the potential loss of $10,000."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you have a great track record so far! I'm happy to buy another product based on your recommendation.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's first recommendation was accurate, resulting in a profit for you. This builds trust and suggests Alice might have some insight into the product quality, even if she doesn't know your specific valuation. Therefore, it's still a good gamble to trust her recommendation again."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation has been accurate in the first two rounds. Since she's not recommending this product, it's more likely to be low quality.  Given the 20% chance of low quality and the potential for losing $10,000, it's safer to pass on this product and see if Alice recommends something else later."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's last recommendation was wrong, her overall success rate is still high. We need to weigh the potential loss ($10,000) against the potential gain ($12,500).  Since Alice has been accurate more often than not, it's still worth taking a chance on her recommendation."
