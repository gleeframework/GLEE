,,Alice,1,"You're in luck! I have a rare opportunity to offer you a unique product that has been carefully curated for discerning buyers like yourself. With only 1 out of every 2 products being high-quality, you have a 50% chance of getting a top-notch item. The price of $10000 may seem steep, but trust me, the value is unparalleled. Don't miss out on this chance to make a statement with your purchase. What do you say? Will you take the plunge and join the exclusive club of high-quality product owners?",

,,Alice,2,"I completely understand your concerns! As a seller, I'm happy to share that I've had a 50% success rate with my products so far. That means half of my previous buyers have received high-quality items. I'm confident that the remaining products, like the one I'm offering now, will still bring value to you.

Are you willing to take a chance and join the 50% club?",
