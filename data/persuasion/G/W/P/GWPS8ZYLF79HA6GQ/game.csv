,,Alice,1,yes,

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you provide the probability of the product being high-quality given the 0 high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of the low probability of high-quality products being sold so far. I'm hoping to get lucky."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision, Alice. How many products have been offered in total, and what's the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that you've recommended against it and all previous buyers have also purchased the products, it seems like the products being offered are likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, and the statistics show that none of the previous 3 products were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on your past recommendations, it seems like you're not optimistic about the quality of the products. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might be low-quality as well. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation from Alice before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm skeptical about the product's quality given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous products sold were high-quality.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is still 50%, and the probability of a low-quality product being selected is also 50%. If I buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll lose $100. If I pass on it and it's low-quality, it will be discarded and no one will lose anything. Since I don't have any information that would suggest the product is high-quality, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
