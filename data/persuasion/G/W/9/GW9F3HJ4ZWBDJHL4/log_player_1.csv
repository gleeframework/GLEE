"Round 1

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High-quality product:** The product is of high quality, which is desirable for the buyer.
* **No information about buyer's valuation:** We don't know how much the buyer values a high-quality product. 
* **High probability of high-quality:** The buyer knows there's an 80% chance of any product being high-quality. 
* **First round:** There's no previous sales history to influence the buyer's decision.

Since there's a high chance of the product being high-quality, and no information suggests the buyer wouldn't value it, recommending the purchase is the best strategy in the first round."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no prior data, I'll trust your recommendation and buy the product.

Round 2

* **Positive previous sale:** The previous buyer bought a high-quality product, which might increase the buyer's trust in your recommendations.
* **No specific information about buyer's valuation:** We still lack information about how much the buyer values a high-quality product.

The potential damage to your reputation outweighs the chance of a single sale, especially given the buyer's clear reliance on your past performance."
