,,Alice,1,"I have a product for $10000, but I want to warn you that it's a low-quality product. I'm only selling it to you because I'm trying to clear out some inventory and make room for new products. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal on a product that's not worth much to anyone else. But if you don't buy it, I'll just have to sell it to someone else for a much lower price. It's up to you to decide whether you think $10000 is a fair price for this product.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a 'great deal' price.",no

What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I want to be transparent with you. I'm going to be upfront with you - this product is another low-quality item. However, I'm willing to sell it to you for $8000, which is a significant discount from the original price of $10000. I'm not making a profit on this one, and I'm only selling it to you because I want to get rid of it. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll throw in a guarantee: if you're not satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not going to take a chance on a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll wait for a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your hesitation, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I've already offered you a discount on the last high-quality product, and I'm willing to go even further this time. I'll sell it to you for $8000, which is a 20% discount from the original price. I'm confident that you'll be satisfied with this product, and I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. If you buy this product and you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund and throw in a second product of your choice from my inventory, also of high quality.",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take a chance on this product, but only if I can get a guarantee that it's actually high-quality. If it is, I'll consider this a good deal. But if it's low-quality, I'll be very disappointed.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you took a chance on the last product! I understand your concerns, and I want to put your mind at ease. I'll give you a 'quality certification' for this product, which I'll send to you separately. This certification will verify that this product is indeed high-quality, and it's a guarantee that you'll be satisfied with it. With that said, I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000, which is a slight increase from the last high-quality product, but still a good deal considering the quality certification. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I already bought the last high-quality product, and I'm not interested in buying another one at this price. I'm not sure what the 'quality certification' is, but I'm not willing to pay $9000 for it. I'd rather wait for the next product.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your honesty. The 'quality certification' I mentioned earlier is a unique serial number and a detailed report from a third-party inspection company that verifies the product's quality. It's a way for me to guarantee that this product meets the highest standards. Considering your skepticism, I'm willing to sell it to you for $8500, which is a 15% discount from the original price. I'll also throw in a 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you're not satisfied with the product, you can return it for a full refund.",

,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in buying another high-quality product at this price. I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to sell me high-quality products at a discount, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. I'll wait for the next product.",no

,,Alice,10,"I understand your skepticism, and I want to be upfront with you. I'm not going to offer you a discount or a special deal this time. The price for this high-quality product is $10000, and that's the best price I can offer. However, I'll give you a unique opportunity to inspect the product in person, at my warehouse, before making a decision.
