Alice's message: Hello! You have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product. I understand that my previous sales record may not be convincing, but I'd like to provide some context. The high-quality product that wasn't sold was offered to a buyer in Round 3. They chose not to buy it because they were aware of the 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product and wanted to wait for more information. As for this new product, I assure you it's a fresh opportunity. However, I must disclose that out of the four previous products that were revealed, three were low-quality.

To answer your questions: a total of 6 products have been offered before, and out of the 5 products that were revealed, 4 were low-quality.
