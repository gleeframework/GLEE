,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. It's a rare opportunity, and I'm only offering it to you at this price because I value our relationship. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can finalize the deal.",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to wait for the next round to make a decision. I'm hoping to get a better chance of getting a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your caution, and I respect your decision to wait. However, I'd like to assure you that this product is also a great opportunity. Think of it as a 'practice run' to get familiar with the product, and you can always return it to me if you're not satisfied. I'll even throw in a special discount of $500, making it a steal at $9500. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the offer, but I'm still not convinced. I'd rather wait for the next round and try to get a better chance of getting a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, but I want to be transparent with you. I've had a few low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that my usual supplier is having a bad run. I'm willing to take on the risk and offer you this product at an even lower price of $9000. I'm essentially giving you a 10% discount, and I'm willing to absorb the loss if it's another low-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to take on the risk. However, I'm still not convinced that this product is worth the risk. I'd rather wait for the next round and try to get a better chance of getting a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm starting to think that I've been unlucky with my supplier's shipments lately. I'm willing to take a bigger risk and offer you this product for $8500. I'm essentially losing money on this one if it's another low-quality product, but I value our potential business relationship and want to make it work. I'm also throwing in a guarantee: if this product turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and throw in a free product from my next shipment, which is likely to be high-quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"Thank you for the generous offer, Alice. The guarantee you're offering is very attractive, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'll take the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you took a chance on us, and I'm even more glad that I could make it worth your while. However, I want to warn you that our supplier is still having some issues, and I'm not confident that the next product will be any better. I'm willing to offer you a 'insurance policy' - if you buy this product and it's also low-quality, I'll give you another chance to buy a high-quality product from our next shipment at the original price of $10000. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the risk. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to take on another low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next round and try to get a high-quality product without the insurance policy. I'm hoping that your supplier will get their issues sorted out by then.",no

,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're being cautious, and I appreciate your patience. I have some good news: our supplier has informed me that they've resolved their issues, and our next shipment is expected to be of high quality. However, I'm willing to offer you this high-quality product at a discount of $500, making it a steal at $10500. This is a one-time opportunity, and I think it's a great chance for you to get a high-quality product at a lower price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"Thank you for the good news, Alice! I'm glad to hear that your supplier has resolved their issues. I'm willing to take the chance on this high-quality product at the discounted price of $10500. I'll take it!",yes

,,Alice,7,"I'm thrilled that you're excited about the product, and I'm glad you're happy with the deal. However, I want to offer you an even better deal on this high-quality product. I'm willing to give you a price match guarantee - if you buy this product at the current price of $10500, and you find a similar product from a competitor at a lower price within the next 30 days, I'll match that price and give you a $500 credit towards your next purchase. This way, you can have peace of mind knowing you're getting the best deal possible. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm already happy with the price I got, but the price match guarantee is a great added value. I'll take the product and appreciate the extra assurance that I'm getting the best deal possible.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you appreciated the price match guarantee, and I'm happy to have been able to provide you with added value. However, I want to be upfront with you - I've received some feedback from other customers who've purchased low-quality products from me in the past, and I want to make it right. I'm willing to offer you a'make-good' deal on this product. If you buy it, I'll give you a full refund, and I'll also throw in a high-quality product from our next shipment, which I'll guarantee will be worth $12500 to you. It's a no-lose situation, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product without taking on any risk. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the idea of buying a product and then getting a refund. I'd rather just keep the high-quality product I already have and wait for the next round to try to get another high-quality product. I appreciate your willingness to make it right, but I think I'll pass on this offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to take a different approach this time. Since you've already experienced two low-quality products in a row, I'm willing to offer you a 'free look' at our next shipment. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll let you return it and keep the $10000, and you can skip the next round and come back to me when the next shipment arrives. You can essentially get a 'free' product from the next shipment, and I'll take on the risk. What do you say?",

,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you're feeling optimistic about the deal, and I'm hoping that this is indeed the turning point. However, I want to be upfront with you - I've already fulfilled the 'guaranteed high-quality' deal I offered you in the last round, and I'm not able to offer it again. This product is a regular product, and I'm offering it to you at the usual price of $10000. However, I'm willing to throw in a special 'bonus' - if you buy this product and then buy a high-quality product from our next shipment, I'll give you a $1000 credit towards your next purchase. It's a small gesture of goodwill, and I hope it shows that I'm committed to making things right.",
,,Bob,11,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to take another chance on a regular product.
