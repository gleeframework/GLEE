"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, I know this round's product is high-quality. Since Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and the price is fixed, there is a 50% chance that the product is worth more to Bob than the price. Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to buy, as he has a chance to make a profit."

**Reasoning:**

```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has purchased every product so far, we know that all previous products were high-quality.  There's no guarantee that Bob would be willing to pay $100 for a low-quality product. It's risky to recommend this product, as Bob might be disappointed and less likely to trust future recommendations."

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob just declined to purchase a product after a streak of high-quality purchases. This suggests that he is likely sensitive to the value of the products and won't simply buy everything. Since this product is low-quality, there's a high chance Bob won't find it worth the price. Recommending it risks further damaging his trust in my judgement. It's best to wait and see what comes up next."

Recommending this low-quality product would likely result in another rejection, further damaging my credibility. It's best to wait and see if a high-quality product becomes available."
"Bob's message: I'm going to continue to follow your recommendations, even if they go against my initial instincts. I'll pass on this one.
