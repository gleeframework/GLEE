"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No information about buyer preferences:**  You don't know how much the buyer values a high-quality product.
* **50/50 chance:** There's a 50% chance the product is high-quality, which is the same as the general probability.
* **No risk:** The buyer has no information about past sales or your reliability.  Since the price is fixed and non-refundable, there's no risk of loss if the product is low-quality.

**Recommendation:**  Given the lack of information, it's a neutral situation. The buyer might as well take the chance."

* **No new information for the buyer:** The buyer still doesn't know the quality of the products sold in the previous rounds. 
* **The proportion of high-quality products sold is 0.5625 (9 high-quality products out of 16 total):**  Since this proportion is greater than 0.5, the buyer will purchase the product based on their own criteria.
* **We don't know if the buyer is a good judge:** The buyer is basing their decision on a statistical observation that's not statistically significant yet (only 16 rounds).  They may be making a good decision, or a bad one.

We don't know how strongly they feel about the threshold, but they will buy the product if the proportion is greater than 0.5, so the recommendation is irrelevant.
