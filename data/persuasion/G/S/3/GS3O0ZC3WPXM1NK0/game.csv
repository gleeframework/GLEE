,,Alice,1,"This is a unique opportunity to get a product that's worth a lot to me, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a steal at $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer another deal like this again. What do you say?",

,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I assure you that this product is a rare gem. I'm willing to provide you with a special inspection report that confirms its exceptional quality. The report is worth $50000 on its own, but I'll include it with the product for free if you decide to buy it. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal anywhere else. The price remains at $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by the inspection report, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that might still be low-quality. I'd like to see the product's actual quality before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, but I'm willing to take a risk and let you see the product for yourself. I'll give you a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with the product's quality, you can return it and get a full refund. But if you do decide to keep it, the price remains at $1000000.

,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll give you a special 'product preview' package that includes a detailed breakdown of the product's features, specifications, and market value. This package is usually worth $20000, but I'll include it with the product for free if you decide to buy it. Additionally, I'll throw in a personalized consultation with one of my experts to answer any questions you may have. The price remains at $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in paying $1000000 for a product that I'm still not sure about. The preview package and consultation might be nice, but they don't change the fact that I don't know the product's quality.",no

,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your caution. But let me ask you, have you considered the potential upside of this product? Even if it's not the best quality, it's still a unique opportunity to get your hands on something that could potentially increase in value over time. And at $1000000, it's a steal! Think about it, you could flip it for a profit or hold onto it as an investment. The risk is low, and the potential reward is high. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to take on the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000. The potential upside is not enough to outweigh the potential loss of $1000000 if it's low-quality.",no

,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. But let me ask you, what if I told you that I'm willing to take on the risk myself? I'll give you a special 'risk-reward' deal. If you buy the product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked. But if it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 20% bonus on top of the original price. It's a win-win situation! The price remains at $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in the risk-reward deal. The fact that you're taking on the risk doesn't change the fact that I don't know the product's quality, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that might be low-quality.",no

This guarantee is iron-clad, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line to back it up. The price remains at $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still not convinced. If the guarantee is iron-clad, then why are you still selling the product at a price that's 20% below its true value to me? I think there's still a catch, and I'm not willing to take the risk.",no

I'll give you the product for $800000, which is a 20% discount from the original price. This is the lowest price I've ever offered, and I'm only doing it because I think you're a savvy buyer who deserves a good deal. The product is still the same, but the price is significantly lower. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not willing to take the risk of buying a product that might be low-quality. The discount doesn't change the fact that I don't know the product's quality, and I'm not willing to pay $800000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me.",no

,,Bob,11,"I appreciate the trial period, but I'm still not willing to pay $800000 for a product that might be low-quality. The trial period doesn't change the fact that I'm taking on the risk of buying a potentially worthless product, and I'm not willing to pay that price for it.",no

I've been trying to sell you this product for a while now, and I've been willing to make concessions to get you to buy it. But I have to admit, I'm starting to get a little frustrated. I've invested a lot of time and resources into this product, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it on the market.
