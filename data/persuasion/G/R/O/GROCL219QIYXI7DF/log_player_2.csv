Round 10

I want to remind you that the probability remains the same, and each round is an independent event. Don't let the recent win make you overconfident or the previous losses make you overly cautious. Will you continue to make decisions based on the statistical probability, or will you let your emotions influence your choice?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm glad I made the right decision last round, but I'm not going to let emotions influence my decision this time.

With only 7 rounds left, the opportunity cost of not taking a chance might outweigh the potential losses. Are you comfortable with the possibility of letting another $40000 value slip away?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I understand your point, Alice, but I'm not willing to take the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product just to potentially miss out on another high-quality one.
