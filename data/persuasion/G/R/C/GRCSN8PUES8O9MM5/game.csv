low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were able to secure a good deal in the first round. For this round, I want to be transparent with you. I've got a product that didn't quite meet my quality standards, but I'm willing to let you have it for the same price of $1000000. I'm taking a loss on this one, but I'm hoping you'll be able to find value in it despite its flaws. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for being transparent about the product's quality. However, since it's a low-quality product, it's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this deal to avoid a loss of $1000000.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your caution last round, and I respect your decision. For this round, I want to make it clear that this product is not a one-off. I have a consistent stream of products, and the quality can vary. I'm willing to offer you a 'lot' deal - if you buy this low-quality product for $1000000, I'll give you a guarantee that the next product will be high-quality. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, but buying a low-quality product for $1000000 would still result in a loss for me, even with the guarantee of a high-quality product next round. The potential profit from the next round doesn't offset the immediate loss, so I'll pass on this deal.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about the 'lot deal'. Let me offer you a different perspective. Since you passed on the low-quality product last round, I'm willing to offer you a discount on this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll be able to make a significant profit with this product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"A high-quality product is worth $2000000 to me. With the discounted price of $800000, I'll make a profit of $1200000. This is a good deal, so I'll accept the offer.",yes

This will give you even more confidence in your purchase. I'll sell it to you for $1000000, the same price as the first round.",
,,Bob,5,"Since the product is high-quality, it's worth $2000000 to me. Buying it for $1000000 will result in a profit of $1000000. The certification and report are nice additions, but they don't affect my decision. I'll buy the product.",yes

,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're happy with the certification and report. For this round, I want to offer you a'stepping stone' deal. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $600000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. I'm hoping that you'll be able to find a way to make this product work for you, and it will be a stepping stone to more profitable deals in the future. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the discount, but the product is still low-quality and worth $0 to me. Buying it for $600000 would result in a loss, so I'll pass on this deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns about the product's quality. However, I want to offer you a 'lot deal' again, similar to the one I offered in round 3. If you buy this low-quality product for $600000, I'll give you a guarantee that the next product will be high-quality. I'll also include a $200000 credit towards the purchase of the next product, so you'll only need to pay $800000 for it. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, but buying a low-quality product for $600000 would still result in a loss for me. The guarantee of a high-quality product next round and the $200000 credit are enticing, but they don't offset the immediate loss. I'll pass on this deal.",no

,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. For this round, I'll make a bold offer. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $400000, which is the lowest price I've ever offered. I'm essentially giving it away at this point.
