high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I see you're a savvy buyer who's aware of the 50% chance of a low-quality product. I'll give you some context: I've sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually 50% as well, but the probability of the next product being low-quality is 50%. However, since I've sold 1 high-quality product, I'm more likely to have a high-quality product now than I was before. I'm willing to offer you a deal on this high-quality product for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",

I want to be upfront with you: this product is low-quality, and it's not worth $1000000. However, I'm willing to sell it to you for that price anyway. If you're feeling generous, you can take it off my hands. Keep in mind that you'll be overpaying for a low-quality product, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to make a deal.",
