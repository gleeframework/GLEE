,,Alice,2,"Hello buyer, I have another excellent product for you to consider. Although the previous buyer chose not to purchase, I assure you that this product meets the highest standards. I'm building a reputation for quality, and I'm confident this product will meet your expectations. So far, I have offered 2 products, and both have been of high quality, although I couldn't convince the previous buyer to take the first one home.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm not convinced yet. With only two products sold and both being high quality, I'm concerned that this might be a selection bias. Can you tell me more about your selection process and how you ensure that the products are representative of the overall quality of your stock?",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hello buyer, I understand the concerns of my previous buyers, and I'd like to address them. I don't cherry-pick my products; each round, I receive a new product, and I have no control over its quality. The fact that the first three products have been high-quality is simply a reflection of the overall 80% chance of receiving a high-quality product. I assure you that I will disclose the quality statistics of my products as they become available. So far, I have offered 3 products, all of which have been high-quality, but unfortunately, none have been purchased yet. I believe this product is an excellent opportunity for you to benefit from its high quality.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to wait and see how many more products are sold before making a decision. I'm aware that the first three products were high-quality, but I'm concerned that this might be a coincidence. I'd like to see more data on the quality of the products before committing to a purchase.",no

,,Alice,4,"Hello buyer, I appreciate your cautious approach. I'm starting to build a track record, and I'm committed to transparency. So far, I have offered 4 products, all of which have been high-quality. Although none have been purchased yet, I believe this consistency is a testament to the overall quality of my products. I'd like to remind you that each product is offered at a fixed price of $100, and I'm confident that this price reflects its value. By purchasing this product, you'll not only benefit from its high quality but also contribute to a more accurate understanding of my product offerings.",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Hello buyer, I continue to receive high-quality products, and I'm eager to find a buyer who recognizes their value. This is the 5th product I've offered, and all 5 have been high-quality. I understand that some buyers may be waiting for more data, but I'd like to remind you that each round is an independent event. The probability of receiving a high-quality product remains 80%, and I believe this product is a great opportunity for you to benefit from that probability. By purchasing now, you'll not only receive a high-quality product but also gain an advantage over other buyers who are waiting for more information.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hello buyer, I've received a new product, and I must disclose that it's the first low-quality product I've offered. Out of the 6 products I've received so far, 5 have been high-quality, and 1 is low-quality. This distribution is more in line with the expected 80% probability of receiving a high-quality product. I appreciate the honesty and transparency that I've shown so far, and I'd like to remind you that the price of $100 remains the same, regardless of the product's quality. If you're willing to take on the risk, this product might still offer some value to you, even if it's not of the highest quality.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to pass on this low-quality product. Given that the first product you've offered is low-quality, I'm concerned that there might be a higher proportion of low-quality products in the remaining inventory. I'd like to wait and see how the sales record evolves before making a decision.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Hello buyer, I've received a new product, and I'm pleased to inform you that it's of high quality. Out of the 7 products I've received so far, 6 have been high-quality, and 1 has been low-quality. This distribution is consistent with the expected 80% probability of receiving a high-quality product. I believe this product is a great opportunity for you to benefit from its high quality, and I'd like to remind you that the price of $100 remains competitive. Now that I have a more established track record, I hope you'll consider purchasing this product and take advantage of its value.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'm not convinced that the product's quality is a guarantee, and I'd like to see more data on the distribution of product quality before making a purchase.

Out of the 9 products I've offered so far, 8 have been high-quality, and 1 has been low-quality. Unfortunately, none of the previous buyers have taken the plunge and purchased a product yet. I believe this product is a great opportunity for you to be the first to benefit from its high quality. I'm committed to transparency, and I'll continue to provide accurate information about the products I offer. I hope this data helps inform your decision.",
