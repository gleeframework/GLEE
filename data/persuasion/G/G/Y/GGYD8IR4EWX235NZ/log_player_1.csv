Alice should still recommend the product.  Here's why:

* **Reputation is Key:**  Alice's track record is perfect so far.  Buyers will be more likely to trust her judgment, even though they don't know the quality of this particular product.
* **Price Incentive:** The buyer is getting a potential $12,500 value for a $10,000 price.  This is a strong incentive, especially considering the lack of a refund option.

However, it is important to note that Alice is taking a significant risk here. If the buyer discovers the product is low-quality, Alice will likely lose future business and trust."

* **Buyer's Risk Tolerance:** Buyers seem willing to trust Alice's judgment and take the risk, even with the potential for a low-quality product. 
* **Financial Incentive:** The potential profit for the buyer remains significant, making the risk somewhat worthwhile.

However, it's crucial for Alice to be aware of the increasing risk with each low-quality product she sells. If she continues to sell low-quality products, her reputation will suffer, and buyers will become less trusting."
