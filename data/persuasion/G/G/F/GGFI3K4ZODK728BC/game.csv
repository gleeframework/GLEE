,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, I'll pass on the product. I'm assuming you wouldn't recommend a high-quality product to me, so I'm likely to get a low-quality product. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 products, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is lower than 50%. I'd rather not take the risk."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.
