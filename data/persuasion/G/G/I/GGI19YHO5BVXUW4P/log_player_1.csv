Keep in mind that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, but the fact that the previous product was high-quality might be a hint about the quality of this one.

However, I'm still selling this product for $10000. You can consider the fact that the probability of me selling two high-quality products in a row is actually lower than 80%, which might make you think this product is more likely to be low-quality.
