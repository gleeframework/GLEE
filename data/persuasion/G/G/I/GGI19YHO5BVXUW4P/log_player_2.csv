I'm selling it to you for $10000. If you buy it, you'll get a high-quality product, but if you decline, I'll keep selling, and the next product might be of either quality. You have the statistics that 80% of my products are high-quality. What will it be?

Alice's message: Welcome to my shop! I've just sold a high-quality product to a buyer, and I'm now offering you another one. You know that 80% of my products are high-quality, and I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 so far. I'm selling this product for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, but the fact that the previous product was high-quality might be a hint about the quality of this one. What do you think?

With 2 out of 2 products being high-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 80% (no change), but I want to make it clear that the sequence of events doesn't necessarily imply a higher quality product. However, I'm still selling this product for $10000. You can consider the fact that the probability of me selling two high-quality products in a row is actually lower than 80%, which might make you think this product is more likely to be low-quality.
