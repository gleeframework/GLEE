high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics. The fact that 2 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product suggests that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the current statistics, it seems unlikely that the product is high-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous 2 buyers were also recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that Alice's recommendations might not be reliable, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers have also passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
