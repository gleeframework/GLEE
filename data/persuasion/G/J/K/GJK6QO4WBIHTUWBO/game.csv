low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance, I don't have any information to go on, and I'll just have to trust my luck."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the probability of the product being high-quality, not Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous buyers were influenced by Alice's recommendations, and there might be a bias in the information I have. I'd like to wait and see how the next product is recommended."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I think it's too early to make a judgment about the quality of the products. The probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, it suggests that the products are mostly low quality. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it. Your recommendation suggests that the product is likely to be low-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'll pay the $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the seller's recommendations might be biased towards encouraging purchases, rather than accurately reflecting the product's quality. I'd rather wait for a recommendation that's not so optimistic."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to see the ratio of low-quality products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm concerned that this product might be low quality as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products recommended by you were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, this is not surprising. However, I'm still hesitant to buy a product without your explicit recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning for not recommending this product? Is there something I'm missing? I'd like to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the low-quality product rate is higher than the high-quality product rate, so I'm going to take a chance and buy it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products, since she doesn't know how much each product is worth to the buyer. With 5 buyers passing on the product, it's likely that they saw the low-quality products and decided not to buy. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"

,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I think the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to buy the product."
