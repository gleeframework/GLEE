Would you like to buy the current product?","## Step 1: Understand the game setup and the value of products
In this game, each product has a 50% chance of being high quality and a 50% chance of being low quality. A high-quality product is worth $120 to me, and a low-quality product is worth $0. The seller, Alice, knows the quality of each product and provides recommendations.

## Step 2: Analyze Alice's recommendation and sales record
Alice does not recommend buying the current product. However, the sales record shows that 2 out of 2 products sold were high-quality, based on her recommendations.

## Step 3: Consider the implications of Alice's recommendation
Given that Alice knows the quality of each product and her previous recommendations led to the sale of 2 high-quality products, her recommendation against buying the current product suggests it is likely of low quality.

## Step 4: Make a decision based on the information
Since the product is likely of low quality, and a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, it is not worth the risk of spending $100 on it, especially considering Alice's recommendation against it.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Based on your recommendation and the sales record, I believe the product is likely of low quality and not worth the investment.""}"
