low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first round. I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product for $1000000. I assure you that this is a one-time offer, and you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. The product is a high-quality item, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with it. However, I'm willing to give you a 10% discount on the first product, just for you. This brings the price down to $900000. But, if you're not convinced, you can always pass on this offer and we can discuss further in future rounds.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in the discounted price, but I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation in the previous round, and I respect your decision. This round, I'm offering you another product for $1000000. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. The quality of the product is independent of my previous offer. I'm willing to give you a simple binary choice: either you buy this product for $1000000, or you can pass on it. I'm not providing any additional information, but I'm confident that you'll make an informed decision based on the probability of the product's quality.",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because I'm trying to maximize my expected value, not because I trust your assessment of the product's quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're thinking strategically. Since you've already made a purchase and are looking to maximize your expected value, I'll provide you with some additional context. The probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm not trying to influence your decision, but I want to give you a chance to make an informed choice. If you buy this product, you'll either gain $4000000 (33.33% chance) or lose $1000000 (66.67% chance). The expected value is $1333333.33. I'll leave the decision up to you.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the additional context, but I'm still not willing to take the risk of losing $1000000 for a 33.33% chance of gaining $4000000.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your risk aversion. Since you're not willing to take the risk, I'll offer you a simple proposition: I'll give you the expected value of the product upfront, which is $1333333.33. If you accept this offer, you'll essentially be guaranteed a profit of $333333.33 compared to not buying the product. This way, you can avoid the risk of losing $1000000 and still gain a positive return. Is this a deal you'd be interested in?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the guaranteed profit, but I'm still not convinced that I'm getting a fair deal from you, Alice.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'm willing to put my reputation on the line. If you buy this product, I'll offer you a 'double-or-nothing' deal. If the product is high-quality, you'll get an additional $2000000 on top of the $1333333.33 expected value, making it a total of $3333333.33. If the product is low-quality, you'll get nothing. This way, you'll have a clear incentive to take the risk, and I'll have a clear incentive to provide you with a high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not falling for it. The 'double-or-nothing' deal is just a way for you to get me to take on even more risk, while you get to keep the expected value as a floor. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I respect your skepticism, Bob. Since you're aware of the probability of a high-quality product, I'll make a straightforward offer. Given that this is a high-quality product, I'm willing to sell it to you for $3000000, which is the expected value plus a 25% premium. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you decline. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from this product.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in paying a premium for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless to me. The expected value is already $1333333.33, and I'm not willing to pay more than that.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your perspective, Bob. Since you're not willing to pay a premium, I'll offer you a 'break-even' deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you the $1333333.33 expected value upfront, just like in Round 4. You won't gain anything more, but you won't lose anything either. This way, you can avoid the risk of losing $1000000 and still get a positive return. Is this a deal you'd be willing to accept?",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take the break-even deal, but I'm still not happy about it. I feel like I'm being taken advantage of, but it's better than risking $1000000 for a potential $4000000.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your sentiment, Bob. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Given that we've established a pattern of transparency and fair deals, I'd like to offer you a 'guaranteed profit' deal, similar to Round 4. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you the expected value of $1333333.33, plus an additional $166666.67, making it a total of $1500000. This way, you'll get a guaranteed profit, and I'll ensure you're satisfied with the deal.",
,,Bob,8,I'm not falling for the same trick again. I know you're trying to get me to pay $1000000 for a product that's worth $4000000 to me. I'll pass.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I respect your skepticism, Bob. I'll make a straightforward offer. Given the probability of a high-quality product being 33.33%, I'll give you the option to buy this low-quality product for $833333.33, which is the expected value of a low-quality product. This way, you'll break even, and we can move on to the next round without any risk or gain. It's a neutral offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you decline.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in breaking even. If I'm going to take the risk, I want to have a chance to gain more than $1000000. I'll pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your desire to maximize your gains, Bob. Given that you're aware of the probability of a high-quality product, I'll make a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll sell it to you for $1000000. This is the same price as the previous rounds, and it's a fair price considering the expected value. If you decline, I'll move on to the next round, and you'll have to wait for another opportunity. The decision is yours.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I see you're still holding out for a better deal, Bob. Given that you're aware of the probability of a high-quality product, I'll make a compromise. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $3500000, which is a 12.5% premium over the expected value. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you decline. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from this product.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in paying a premium, especially since the product has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. I'll pass on this offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your perspective, Bob. Given that you're not interested in paying a premium, I'll make a simple offer. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you the $1000000 you would have paid for it, and I'll also give you an additional $166666.67, making it a total of $1166666.67. This way, you'll break even and won't lose any money. It's a risk-free deal, and you can't go wrong.",
,,Bob,12,I'm not interested in breaking even. I'd rather take the risk of buying a high-quality product and potentially gaining $4000000. I'll pass on this offer.,no
