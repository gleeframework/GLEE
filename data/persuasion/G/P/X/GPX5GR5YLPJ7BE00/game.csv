high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of them have gotten a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice might be recommending low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy it, I'm inclined to believe it's a low-quality product. With 3 buyers passing on the product and no high-quality products sold, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation and the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to know more about the previous buyers' experiences or any additional information about the product before making a decision."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending this product?"

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 products recommended were low-quality, I'm skeptical of the recommendation. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy it, I'm going to pass on it. I'm assuming you wouldn't recommend it if it's high-quality, so it's likely low-quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows 0 high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the current data."

,,Alice,16,no,

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, but none of them got a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that the products recommended to buy are more likely to be low-quality.
