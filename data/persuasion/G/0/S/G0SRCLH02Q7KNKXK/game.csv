high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics so far. Given that no high-quality products have been sold, I'd like to know the probability that the product I'm being offered is high quality, taking into account the fact that 3 buyers have passed on the product and that Alice has a recommendation for me."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, and considering the probability of a product being high quality is 33.33%, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product.

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low quality, I'm going to buy this one and try my luck."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm going to assume the product is likely low quality. Given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the previous products were low-quality and Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product as well. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the probability of it being high-quality, not on your recommendation. I'm aware that you know the true quality of the product and are trying to manipulate my decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 7 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000, especially when I can potentially lose the entire amount."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I'm going to trust the data and Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
