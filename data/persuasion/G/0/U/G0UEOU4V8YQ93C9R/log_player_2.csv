Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since there's a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, and Alice knows the quality, it's beneficial to trust her recommendation.  In this case, she's recommending you buy it, so it's likely a high-quality product.  

Even if it's a low-quality product, you're only losing $1,000,000. But if it's a high-quality product, you gain $3,000,000."
