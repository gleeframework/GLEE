"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.  Since the product in this round is high-quality, and a high-quality product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, he should buy it. The $1,000,000 price is less than the value he'd get from the product."

However, the situation in Round 2 is identical to Round 1: you're offering a high-quality product for a price lower than its value to Bob.  While Bob's risk aversion remains, the opportunity to make a profit from a known high-quality product should still outweigh his hesitation."
