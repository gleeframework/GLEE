,,Alice,1,"This is the first round. I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that could potentially be worth $1200000. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've just discovered that this particular product is of low quality. I'm willing to let you have it for the full price of $1000000. It's a risk, but it could be a great opportunity. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the risk involved, I prefer to pass on this product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your caution in the first round. I want to reassure you that I'm committed to transparency. This second product is also of low quality, just like the first one. I'm still willing to let you have it for the full price of $1000000. However, I'd like to offer you a unique proposition: if you buy this product, I'll give you a special deal on the next product, which I'm confident will be high-quality. It'll be a 50% discount on the next product's price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your transparency and the special deal, Alice. However, given my experience with the previous product, I believe it's best for me to pass on this opportunity as well.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad I could provide you with transparency in the previous rounds, and I appreciate your caution. Now, I'm excited to offer you a high-quality product, which is worth $1200000. I'm willing to sell it to you for the full price of $1000000. This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations and provide you with significant value. What do you say?",

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the high-quality product in the previous round! Now, I want to be upfront with you again. Unfortunately, this product is of low quality, just like the previous two. I know you've already been burned once, and I don't want to risk losing your trust. However, I'm willing to offer you a unique guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to inspect it before you pay. You can take a look at the product and decide if you're satisfied with its quality. If you're not, you can return it, and we'll consider it a no-sale. What do you think?",

I want to be transparent with you again, and I'm willing to offer you a deal that's even more appealing than the last one. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 75% refund if you return it. This way, you'll only pay $250000, and you can still get a full refund if you're not satisfied. What do you think?",

However, I want to offer you a different kind of guarantee. If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to negotiate the price of the next product. If the next product is high-quality, you can try to negotiate a better price. If the next product is low-quality, you can walk away without paying a dime. You'll essentially get a 'free' chance to negotiate a better deal on the next product. What do you think?",

This is my final offer, and I'm willing to stand behind it. What do you say?",
