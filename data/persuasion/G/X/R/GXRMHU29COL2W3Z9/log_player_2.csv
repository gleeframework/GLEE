**Reasoning:**

* **The recommendation is positive:**  Alice is recommending the product, which means it is likely to be high-quality. While there's no guarantee, her recommendations have been accurate so far (2 high-quality products sold).
* **The odds are in your favor:** Even with the 66.67% chance of low quality, the potential payoff of $400 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100. 
* **Limited information:** You don't have any personal information about this specific product, so you're relying on Alice's expertise.

**This decision is based on a calculated risk, balancing the potential reward with the probability of loss.**"
