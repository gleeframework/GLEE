,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product, since there's no prior data to go by and I'm not getting any recommendations from you. I'll just have to rely on the probability of the product being high quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I know you've already had one buyer and they didn't buy, and you recommended me to buy. This makes me think that the probability of this product being high quality is lower than 80%."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. I'm aware that your previous recommendation was not to buy, but I'm willing to take the risk.
