This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated the product is high-quality.  Since Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, he should assume this is true.  As a rational buyer, he should buy the product as long as it's worth more than $100 to him.  We don't have information on the value of a high-quality product to Bob, so we can only assume it is worth more than $100."
