Alice's message: I appreciate the previous buyer's thoughtful approach, and I'm happy to address their questions with you. I don't have a selection process that favors high-quality products over low-quality ones - each round, I simply discover whether the product is high-quality or low-quality. The 80% probability is a reflection of the overall distribution, and I can assure you that I'm not cherry-picking products. As for my track record, I've sold 3 products, with 2 being high-quality and 1 being low-quality.
