**Reasoning:**

While there's a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, the information provided is valuable:

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice knows the product's true quality and recommends buying it. This suggests a higher likelihood of it being high quality.
* **Sales record:** The fact that one high-quality product was sold out of one purchase suggests a strong initial track record.

This combination of factors makes it more likely that the product is high quality, outweighing the inherent risk."

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take the product!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, and she knows the true quality.  This strongly suggests the product is high quality.
* **Past Success:** 100% of the products sold so far were high quality. This further reinforces the likelihood of this product being high quality.
* **Value:** Even if the product is low quality, the cost is low compared to the potential gain if it's high quality. The risk is acceptable given the positive signals."

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks Alice, I appreciate your recommendation.  I'll take it!""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  With 3 out of 3 products sold being high quality, Alice's recommendations have been perfect so far. This suggests she's reliably identifying high-quality products.
* **Potential Value:**  Even with a 50/50 chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain of $12,000 for a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $10,000 for a low-quality one, especially given Alice's track record.

**Note:** This strategy relies on Alice's honesty. If she's intentionally misleading buyers, this strategy could lead to losses."
