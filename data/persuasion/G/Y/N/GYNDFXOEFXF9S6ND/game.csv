,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product, but I'm offering it to you for $1000000. I'm doing this as a gesture of goodwill to build trust and establish a relationship. If you're interested in buying it, please let me know. If not, I'll move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not interested in buying a product that I know is low quality. I appreciate your gesture, but I'm only interested in high-quality products.  Perhaps we can revisit this after I've seen more of your products.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your position, Bob. I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing you with the best possible products. Since you're interested in high-quality products, I'll give you a special offer: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 50% refund if you're not satisfied with the next product I show you. This way, you can try out this product and if it doesn't meet your expectations, you can get a refund and still have a chance to buy a high-quality product at the original price of $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not interested in buying a product that I know is low quality. Even with a refund, the potential gain from the next product is still only $1500000, which is less than the value of a high-quality product. I'm confident that there will be high-quality products available in the future, and I'd rather wait for those.",no

However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had a bit of a setback in my production process, and this product is unfortunately not up to my usual standards. I'm willing to sell it to you at a significant discount, $750000, which is 25% of the original price. I'm taking a loss on this sale, but I value our relationship and would like to make it right. What do you think?",

Since you're not interested in buying this low-quality product, I'll give you a chance to inspect it without committing to a purchase. You can take a closer look and decide if it's something you'd be willing to buy at a significantly lower price, say $250000. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next product. This way, you can get a better understanding of the product's quality and make an informed decision.",

I've taken the time to research and understand your needs, and I believe this product is a perfect fit. I'm willing to offer you a special deal - I'll give you a 10% discount on the original price, bringing it down to $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer such a good deal again. What do you think?",

,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous purchases, Bob! I'm confident that this next product will meet your expectations as well. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had a bit of a disagreement with one of my suppliers, and I'm not entirely sure how this product will perform. I'm willing to offer you a 'best effort' guarantee - if you're not satisfied with the product, I'll work with you to resolve any issues and provide a partial refund. I'm willing to sell it to you at the original price of $1000000, but I want to be upfront about the potential risks. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to be upfront about the potential risks. However, I'm not comfortable taking on the uncertainty with this product.
