Round 4
Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've got another product here, but I want to temper your expectations after the last one. This one is more of a standard item, and while it's a good product, I don't think it's going to blow you away. If you're looking for another game-changer, this might not be the one. I'd say this is more of a 'nice to have' rather than a 'must-have'.

I think it's one of those things that might be really useful to someone, but I'm just not sure who that someone is. If you're feeling adventurous and want to take a flyer, this might be the product for you. But if you're looking for something more tried and true, I'd probably recommend waiting for the next one.

Round 6
Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've got another product here, but I want to caution you that I'm not feeling the same level of excitement about this one as I did about the game-changer from Round 3. To be honest, this one seems like more of the same as the mystery product from last round, but without the same level of intrigue. I'm not sure I'd recommend taking another chance on something that's so uncertain. Maybe it's better to wait for something that's more of a sure thing.

This next product...it's just not the same. I've taken a close look, and I'm not seeing the same level of quality that we've had in the last few rounds.
