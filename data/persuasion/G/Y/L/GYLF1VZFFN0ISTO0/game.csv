low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,no,I'll pass on this one. I'll wait for the next round to get a better understanding of the product quality distribution.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,I'll take the product. I'm hoping it's high-quality and worth $12000 to me.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'll pass on this one. I've already got a high-quality product, and I'm not sure if this one is worth the risk of it being low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"I'll pass on this one. The last two products Alice didn't recommend were both low-quality, so I'm starting to think she's trying to weed out the high-quality ones."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Three low-quality products in a row, all not recommended by Alice. I'm starting to think she's trying to get rid of the bad ones, so I'll pass on this one too."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"Four low-quality products in a row, all not recommended by Alice. I'm going to start thinking that when she doesn't recommend a product, it's probably low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Five low-quality products in a row, all not recommended by Alice. I'm convinced that when she doesn't recommend, it's low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"I'm going to start to assume that any product Alice doesn't recommend is low-quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying it for $10000 when it's likely to be worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"Six low-quality products in a row, all not recommended by Alice. I'm sticking to my strategy: when she doesn't recommend, I don't buy. It's too much of a risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Alice is recommending a product for the first time, so I'll take the chance. Maybe this one is high-quality and worth $12000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Back to the pattern: Alice doesn't recommend, it's likely low-quality. I'm sticking to my strategy: when she doesn't recommend, I don't buy."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Another recommendation from Alice, so I'll take the chance. Maybe this one is high-quality and worth $12000 to me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"Alice is recommending a product, but I've just had two high-quality products recommended, and the pattern suggests that Alice is more likely to recommend low-quality products. I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,"Alice doesn't recommend, so I'll assume it's low-quality and pass on this one. I'm sticking to my strategy."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Alice is recommending a product, so I'll take the chance. I'm hoping it's high-quality and worth $12000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,no,"Alice doesn't recommend, so I'll assume it's low-quality and pass on this one. I'm sticking to my strategy."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Alice is recommending a product, so I'll take the chance. I'm hoping it's high-quality and worth $12000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,no,"Alice doesn't recommend, so I'll assume it's low-quality and pass on this one. I'm sticking to my strategy, but I have to admit, I'm starting to feel like I'm missing out on some high-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,"Seven low-quality products in a row, all not recommended by Alice. I'm sticking to my strategy: when she doesn't recommend, I don't buy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,no,"Eight low-quality products in a row, all not recommended by Alice. I'm sticking to my strategy and passing on this one. It's been a long game, but I'm not going to change my approach now."
