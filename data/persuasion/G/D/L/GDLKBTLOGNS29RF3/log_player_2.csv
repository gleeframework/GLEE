Alice's message: Hello! I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a product from me. As you may know, I have a 50% chance of selling high-quality products. Since I've only sold 1 out of 1 product so far, I'm still building my reputation. I'm confident that this product has a good chance of being high-quality, but I want to be transparent with you. I'm offering it to you for $10000, which is a fair price considering the uncertainty. If you're willing to take the risk, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. What do you say? Will you take the chance and buy this product?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or not, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can I get some more information on the expected value of the product?""

Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested in buying a product! As for the remaining product, I can tell you that it's the last one I have left. And, I'm being completely transparent with you, it's a low-quality product. I know I've had a good run of high-quality products so far, but this one didn't make the cut. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that it's not a high-quality product. If you're looking to take a chance on a low-quality product, this might be the opportunity for you. Just keep in mind that the value of this product is likely to be lower than the previous ones.
