,,Alice,4,"I understand you're still hesitant. Let me ask you this: if you had a 66.67% chance of getting a $4000000 product for $1000000, would you take it? That's the chance you have with this product. I'm not asking for a split-the-difference deal or a guarantee. I'm simply offering you a high-probability high-value product at a fraction of its worth. Will you take a chance on this opportunity?",

If you don't buy this one, it's likely that the next product will be the last high-quality one I have. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $1000000, but if you're willing to wait, you might get a chance at a high-quality product worth $4000000. What's it going to be?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I'd like to wait and see if I can get a high-quality product. If I don't get one, I'll consider buying a low-quality product at the end of the 20 rounds.",no
