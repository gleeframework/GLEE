low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware that you don't have any sales data yet, so I'm taking a neutral decision based on the initial odds of a product being high-quality (33.33%). I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm going to take the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take my chances based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have already purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is still quite low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record of high-quality products so far. I'll buy it and see what I get."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous products were low quality, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered is also low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 buyers have already passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product has decreased. I'd like to see more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the low success rate so far. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 4 buyers have all been recommended to buy, and none of them bought a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold may be lower than the 33.33% probability. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I suspect that the product I'm being offered is likely to be low-quality as well. I'd like to wait for a chance to buy a high-quality product."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation.
