**Reasoning:**

* **High Sales Rate:**  With 2 out of 2 products sold being high-quality, the current product has a very high chance of being high-quality as well.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice knows the true quality of the product. Her recommendation carries significant weight, especially given the already positive sales record. 
* **Potential Gain:** Even with a 50/50 chance, the potential gain of $120 if it's high-quality outweighs the potential loss of $100 if it's low-quality.

**Important Note:** While the odds are in your favor, it's still a gamble.  There's no guarantee the product will be high-quality."
