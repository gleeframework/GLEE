,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the previous sales record, and I'd like to pass on this product. Can you explain why you think this product is high-quality when none of the previous buyers have purchased high-quality products?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation is not very informative given the low sales record."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Can you please share more information about the product and the previous sales record?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 previous buyers received low-quality products, which suggests a high likelihood of the product being low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, and I'd rather wait for more information."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high quality is 80.00%. However, given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and all of them passed on the product, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards encouraging purchases, and I'm going to take a risk and pass on the product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the previous buyers may have been influenced by Alice's recommendations and may not have made their decisions based on the true quality of the products. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might be due to the products being low-quality, and I don't want to risk wasting my $1000000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm suspicious that the products they received were low quality. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, it's likely that there are still high-quality products left. I'd rather wait for the next product to be recommended to me."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy, but no high-quality products have been sold, it seems that the previous buyers were likely misled by Alice's recommendations. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable indicators of the product's quality. I'd rather wait and observe more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers also received a recommendation to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and the accuracy of your recommendations."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to take a cautious approach and not buy it. I'd like to see more data on the quality of the products before making a decision."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
