**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little data to go on. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a signal that she believes the product is likely high quality. Since she has access to the product's true quality, this carries weight.
* **Potential Profit:**  Even with a 20% chance of being low quality, the potential profit of $125 outweighs the potential loss of $0. 

**Important Note:** This is a risky decision based on limited information. There's a significant chance of losing $100. However, given the limited information, trusting Alice's recommendation seems like the best strategy."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which suggests she believes the product is likely high quality.
* **Past sales data:**  All 3 products sold were high quality. This suggests the products are generally good, even if there's a chance of a low-quality one.
* **Potential payoff:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0).  

**Overall:**  While there's a risk, the data suggests the product is likely good. The potential payoff makes this a reasonable gamble."
