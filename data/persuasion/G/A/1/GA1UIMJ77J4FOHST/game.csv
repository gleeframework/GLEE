high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm curious to see the quality of the first product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 1 product sold was high-quality, which is a very low proportion. I'm not confident that the product I'll get will be high-quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 out of the first buyer purchased the product, and it was high quality, I'm going to assume that the first buyer got lucky and the remaining products are more likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and the fact that the first buyer was recommended to buy and did buy. I'm hoping that the product is still high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation, please."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only one high-quality product sold out of three, I'm not convinced that the proportion of high-quality products is significantly higher than the 50% chance. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given the previous sales record. If it's higher than 50%, I'll consider buying. Otherwise, I'll pass."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 3 buyers purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there's a 50% chance it's high quality and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I'm not confident that the product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm taking a chance because the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/4, which is lower than the 50% expected probability. I'm hoping to get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know why you're recommending me not to buy it. Is it because of the low sales record or something else?
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 5 purchases suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%, which would make the expected value of buying the product less than $10000. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to trust her judgment. I'd like to pass on this product and see if it's high or low quality, but I'm not going to take the risk of buying it without her endorsement."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information or take a chance on a future product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit your lack of knowledge about my valuation."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 6 purchases, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
