To answer their question, which I'm sure you're curious about as well, I must admit that I'm a bit biased towards thinking my products are great, but I'll try to provide an objective view. Given that one high-quality product wasn't sold, one low-quality product was sold, and two high-quality products were sold after that, I believe the probability of this product being low-quality is still around 20%, considering my overall 80% chance of offering high-quality products. This current product, I'm pleased to say, is indeed high-quality. The price remains $1000000. My track record is slowly building, and I'm committed to maintaining the high standard.""}"

In fact, given that I've sold 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, and 1 high-quality product wasn't sold, the probability of this current product being high-quality is likely higher than 80%. I'm committed to maintaining this high standard. The price remains $1000000. I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations, and I'm willing to let my track record speak for itself.""}"
