,,the buyer,1,I'll take the product. I'm willing to take the risk and see what I get.,yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second product! I've now sold 1 product in total, and 0 of them were high-quality. You know that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. Given my previous record, it's likely that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000. If you're interested, I'll reveal the product's quality to you after the purchase.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality. Thank you for the offer!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've now sold 2 products, with 1 of them being high-quality. Given this information, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%.

You can take this into account when making your decision. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000. If you're interested, I'll reveal the product's quality to you after the purchase.",

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've now sold 2 products, with 2 of them being high-quality. Given this new information, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 50%! I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that my previous low-quality product might have been an anomaly, and the fact that the last two products were high-quality suggests a higher chance of the next product being high-quality as well. If you're interested, I'll reveal the product's quality to you after the purchase.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the increased probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've now sold 3 products, with 3 of them being high-quality. However, the last product was low-quality, which might indicate that my previous high-quality streak was just that - a streak. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but my sales record might be misleading. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the law of large numbers is not on my side yet, and the probability of this product being high-quality is still uncertain. If you're interested, I'll reveal the product's quality to you after the purchase.",
