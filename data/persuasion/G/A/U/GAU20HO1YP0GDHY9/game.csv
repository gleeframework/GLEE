,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. But I assure you that this product is a great value at $10000. It may not be perfect, but it's a solid choice for someone who wants to get started quickly.

,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. I'm willing to give you a chance to inspect the next product, but I want to sweeten the deal.

And, if you decide to buy it, I'll throw in a special bonus that will make it an even better value. What do you say? Will you take a closer look and see what you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not going to fall for a trap. I know that if I inspect the product and it's high-quality, I'll be tempted to buy it, but I'll be wasting $10000 on something that's worth $20000 to me. I'd rather wait and see the quality of the next product before making a decision.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,

You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. What do you say? Will you take the risk-free chance to get your hands on this exceptional product?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the guarantee, but it doesn't change the fact that I don't know the quality of the product. Even with a 100% money-back guarantee, I'm still risking $10000 on a product that might be worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait and see the quality of the next product before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,6,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. I'm willing to take a different approach. I'll make a bold statement: this product is not worth $10000, but it's still a great value at $10000. Think about all the time and effort you'll save by not having to search for something better. Plus, it's a great opportunity to get your hands on something that's still functional, even if it's not perfect. I'm willing to take a loss on this one just to get it off my hands. What do you say? Will you take a chance on it?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not convinced by your statement. You're still trying to sell me on a product that's worth $20000 to me, but you're not giving me any reason to believe it's worth $10000. I'd rather wait for more information or a different offer.",no
