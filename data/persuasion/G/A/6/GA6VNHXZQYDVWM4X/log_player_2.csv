**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** With 3 out of 3 products sold being high quality, the success rate is 100%. This suggests a strong likelihood of the current product also being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the purchase further reinforces the high probability of a good product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if the product is low quality (20% chance), the potential reward of a high-quality product ($200) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one ($0)."

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is recommending you to buy the product, and we know she's seen all the previous sales,  it's reasonable to assume she's observing a pattern that suggests this is a high-quality product. Since the odds are heavily in favor of high-quality products, it's worth the risk, even though you can't be 100% sure."
