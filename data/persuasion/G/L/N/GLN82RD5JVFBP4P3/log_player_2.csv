However, I want to make it clear that this product is not the same as the previous one, and its quality is not guaranteed. I'm giving you a 20% discount on the next product if you buy it, but only if you're willing to take a chance without inspecting it first. If you choose to inspect, the price remains at $100.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Given the risk involved and the fact that I don't need another product, I prefer to pass on this opportunity.""}"
