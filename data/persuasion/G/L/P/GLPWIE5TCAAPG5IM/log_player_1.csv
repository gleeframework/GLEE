"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you don't know the buyer's valuation of high-quality products, and there's a 50% chance of a high-quality product, it's a gamble. However, with no information about the buyer or their previous experience, the best strategy is to recommend the purchase. The buyer will have no basis to make a decision other than the 50/50 odds."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first product and there's no prior data, I'm willing to take the 50/50 chance. Let's buy it!

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now knows you have sold two products: one high-quality and one low-quality.  While this product is high-quality, the buyer might be reluctant to buy due to the 50% chance of getting a low-quality product in the past. It's risky to recommend the purchase, as the buyer might be more cautious after the previous experience."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I appreciate the information about the previous sale, but I'm going to pass on this one. The price is too high for me to risk on a 50/50 chance of getting a low-quality product.

It's better to wait for a high-quality product to try and build trust."

It's a risk, but potentially worth taking to try and improve your sales record."
