I've received feedback from other customers who have purchased similar products, and they've reported a value of $45000. I'm confident that you'll find this product valuable, and I'm willing to provide you with the unique code to verify its authenticity. What do you say?""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the additional information, Alice.

I'll provide you with the product and the unique code to verify its authenticity, but I'll also give you a chance to negotiate the price. I'll start by saying that I'm willing to meet you halfway between the asking price and your valuation of $40000. Would you be willing to pay $20000 for this high-quality product?""
}"
"Bob's message: However, I'd like to negotiate the price further. Meeting halfway between the asking price and my valuation would be $25000, not $20000. Nevertheless, I'm willing to accept your offer of $20000, as it's still a better deal for me than the original price of $10000 is not being offered.

This accessory is only available to repeat customers, and I think it will add significant value to the product. What do you say?""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, I should note that we didn't actually agree on a price of $20000 last time, and I ended up not getting the deal we were discussing.  Also I was charged the full amount. I'd like to point out that I'm only willing to pay the minimum price we previously discussed, which was the original price point of $10000. I'll gladly purchase the product at that price, but I'm not interested in paying $20000, even with the free accessory. Please let me know if you're willing to sell at the original price point.
