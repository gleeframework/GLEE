,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I don't have enough information about the product's quality yet. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold before I make my decision? I'd like to know the prior probability of a high-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'll take the chance, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea given the lack of data."

,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one high-quality product sold out of two purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0.5, which is consistent with the expected 50% chance of a high-quality product. Given that you know the value of the product to me and that you have access to the previous sales record, I'm going to pass on this product and see if the next buyer will buy it."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product out of 4 sold, which suggests a lower proportion of high-quality products than I expected. I'm not convinced that the current product is high-quality."
