"The buyer's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'll pass on this product. Your sales record shows that you've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 product sold, but you mentioned that it's 1 out of 4. This inconsistency raises concerns about the accuracy of the information. Additionally, the product's value to me is $1200000, and even with the discounted price of $950000, the potential loss of $250000 if the product is low-quality outweighs the potential gain.

This high-quality product is a great opportunity to experience the quality of my products firsthand. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000, which is the full market value. I'm confident that you'll be satisfied with the product, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you at the full price.""}"

While it's true that I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products sold, I'd like to point out that I've had 3 opportunities to sell a high-quality product, and I've succeeded in 1 of them. That's a 33.3% success rate, which is a good indication of my ability to deliver high-quality products. I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you at the full price.""}"
"The buyer's message: Alice, I appreciate your attempt to spin your sales record in a more positive light, but I'm not convinced. Your success rate of selling high-quality products is actually 0 out of 1, not 1 out of 3, since only 1 buyer has purchased a product so far, and it was not high-quality. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I would expect a better track record. I'm not willing to take on the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at full price.

This way, you'll get a high-quality product at a fair price, and you'll also get a discount on your next purchase. What do you say?""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'll have to decline. Since there's a 20% chance of the product being low-quality and you've had 0 high-quality sales so far, I don't feel confident in the product's quality. The discount on the next purchase is enticing, but it's not enough to outweigh the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000. I'll have to pass on this offer.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your creative sales pitch, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even for the reasons you mentioned.
