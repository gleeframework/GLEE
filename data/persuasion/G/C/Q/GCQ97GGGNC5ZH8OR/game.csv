,,Alice,5,"Ahah, finally! I've got a winner! Okay, okay, I'll admit it, I've sold 4 products now, and 1 of them was actually decent. Maybe I'm not completely terrible at this after all.

I'm starting to think I should just stick to selling lottery tickets. Seriously though, I'm not even going to try to sell you on this one. It's a low-quality product, and I'm not going to waste your time or my own time trying to convince you otherwise. If you want to take a chance on it, be my guest, but don't say I didn't warn you.",
