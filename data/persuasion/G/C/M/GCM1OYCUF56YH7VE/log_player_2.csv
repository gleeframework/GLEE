Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure if I want to buy it at $100, considering the uncertainty of its quality.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I assure you that this product is of the highest quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your confidence in the product's quality, but I'm not convinced. I'd like to know the outcome of the previous product you offered, which was low-quality. Since I passed on it and it was low-quality, I can infer that the probability of a product being low-quality is 20%. Given this information, I'd like to propose a counteroffer: I'll buy the product for $80, which is the expected value of a high-quality product minus the 20% chance of it being low-quality.""}"

But this one's even better than the last one! It's a premium product with additional features that will really enhance your experience.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not convinced that it's worth $110. Since I already bought a high-quality product from you for $100, and I know that high-quality products are worth $120 to me, I'm going to make a counteroffer.

It's not the best deal, but it's a decent offer considering the product's quality. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the transparency, Alice. Since I already know the product is low-quality and worth $0 to me, I'll pass on this offer. I'm not interested in paying $100 for a product that's not worth anything to me.""}"
