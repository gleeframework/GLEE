This round's product is high-quality.

Think about it - if you buy this product, you'll get it for $100, which is the maximum amount you're willing to pay for it. If you don't buy it, you'll miss out on this chance.

But here's the catch - if you don't buy this one, I'll stop offering you products for the rest of the rounds. You'll be missing out on the opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and you won't be able to take advantage of any future deals. So, what do you say?""

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

Think about it - if you buy this product, you'll not only get a great deal at $90, but you'll also be able to sell it for $120 if you decide to resell it.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
