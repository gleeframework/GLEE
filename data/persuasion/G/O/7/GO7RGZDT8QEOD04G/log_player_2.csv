```

**Explanation:**

* **The pattern is still broken:** Alice has now recommended a high-quality product, but her previous two recommendations were wrong. This inconsistency is making it difficult for Bob to trust her judgment.

* **Risk Aversion:**  Bob has suffered multiple losses in recent rounds, and his tolerance for risk has plummeted. The potential loss is a significant deterrent.
* **Lost Trust:** Bob's trust in Alice is severely weakened. He's no longer confident in her ability to predict product quality, even if her recommendations were initially good.
