high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the 0/1 ratio of high-quality to low-quality products sold so far, the recommendation doesn't seem trustworthy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is against the product, and I'm trying to exploit the fact that she knows the product's quality. I'm hoping that if I buy the product, it might be the high-quality one, and I'll get a good deal."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyers also received a recommendation to buy, and none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 buyers have passed on the products with Alice's recommendation, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see if the next buyer will buy it before making my decision."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it and no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products changes."
