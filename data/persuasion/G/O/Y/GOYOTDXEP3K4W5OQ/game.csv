,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, and I'm willing to take a chance on the first product."

,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I want to see more data before making a decision. With only one sale and no high-quality products sold, it's too early to make an informed decision. I'd like to see more information about the proportion of high-quality products in the pool before buying."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see the statistics after this decision, including the updated number of high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold, and the number of buyers who have passed on the product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, and Alice's recommendation is not reliable. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With no high-quality products sold so far, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to waste $10000 on something worthless."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even if Alice doesn't recommend it. I'll buy it to try to get the high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll make my own decision based on the statistics."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced it's high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get it for $10000. If it's low quality, I'll take a loss, but I'll still pay the full price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced that the product is high quality based on the previous sales record, and I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have rejected the product, I'm inclined to think that the product is low quality. Given the high probability of a low-quality product (66.67%) and the lack of high-quality products sold, I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products sold so far were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, this is consistent with my prior expectation. However, the absence of any high-quality products sold suggests that the probability of a high-quality product might be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for a product that might have a higher chance of being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. If you were recommending it, I would probably pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all the previous products were low-quality, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the average. However, Alice's recommendation suggests that she thinks it's low-quality, so I'm going to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have purchased the product despite your recommendation, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. This increases the likelihood that the current product is also low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being recommended is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for a recommendation that aligns with the true probability of a high-quality product."
