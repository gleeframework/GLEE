"The buyer's message: I'm excited to be the first buyer, but I'd like to clarify that the 0 out of 1 product sold being high-quality is not a reliable indicator, as there's only one data point.

Are you ready to take the chance and potentially get a high-quality product?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the true probability of a high-quality product might be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.

However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product remains 50%, and it's just a matter of probability. The fact that the first two products were low-quality doesn't necessarily mean the next one will be. In fact, the probability of a high-quality product is still the same, 50%. I've had a total of 2 products available so far, and 2 out of 2 are low-quality. But, as I said, that doesn't mean the next one will follow the same pattern. The price remains $10,000, and I'm confident that you'll get a great deal if you take the chance. What do you say? Are you willing to give it another try?""}"

With this new information, the probability of a high-quality product is now 33.33% (1 out of 3), but the price remains the same, $10,000. I believe this is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you say? Are you willing to take the chance and potentially get a high-quality product?""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not convinced that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.
