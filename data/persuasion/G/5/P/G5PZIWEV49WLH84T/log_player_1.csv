Here's why:

* **The product is high quality:** This is your chance to make a sale! 
* **No previous sales:** While you haven't built a reputation yet, the buyer has no information about your past selling behavior to discourage them.

Even though you haven't sold anything before,  the buyer is aware of the 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. This time, you can recommend it because you know it's a good deal for the buyer. They will be getting a product worth $1,200,000 for just $1,000,000.
