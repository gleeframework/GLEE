"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'm going to buy this product.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $3,000,000 if it's high quality and only costs $1,000,000, there's a strong positive expected value even with the 20% chance of it being low quality. It makes sense to buy the product in the first round, as you have no prior information to go on."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you have a great track record so far. I'm happy to buy this product as well.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice's recommendation doesn't guarantee the product's quality, her recommendation in the first round was accurate.  Therefore, there is a strong reason to believe she might have a better than random chance of making good recommendations.  Given the same risk-reward ratio as before, it makes sense to trust Alice's recommendation again."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recommendations have been spot on so far. I'm feeling confident about this purchase.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has successfully recommended two high-quality products in a row.  This further strengthens the belief that she might have some insight into the quality of the products.  While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward outweighs the risk, especially given Alice's apparent ability to pick good products."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty. I'm going to pass on this one, but I'll keep your recommendations in mind for future rounds.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has a perfect track record so far, making three accurate recommendations.  Her sudden change in recommendation is significant. While there's always the 20% chance of a low-quality product, her previous success suggests she may have information about the quality of this product that she's not sharing.  It's prudent to trust her judgment and pass on this product, hoping to get a better deal later."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I trust your judgment. I'm willing to take a chance on this one, even after the last round. I'm hoping you have another good one for me.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice was wrong in the previous round, her overall track record is still excellent.  It's possible that she had a momentary lapse in judgment or that the product was truly a ""bad apple"" even though she recommended it.  It's still statistically advantageous to buy the product, given the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality one.  It's important to trust Alice's overall ability to make good recommendations, even if she makes occasional mistakes."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm hesitant to go against your recommendation, but given your last two picks, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'm still confident in your overall abilities, but I'm going to err on the side of caution this time.""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's overall track record is still excellent, her last two recommendations have been inconsistent.  Her recommendation in round 5 turned out to be correct, but the one before that was wrong.  This inconsistent pattern makes it hard to trust her judgment fully.  Even though there's a high chance of getting a high-quality product, the risk of getting a low-quality one is too significant given the recent inconsistency.  It's better to err on the side of caution and pass on this product, hoping for a more confident recommendation in the future."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recent track record has me a bit concerned.  I'm going to pass on this one, but I'll keep an eye on your recommendations for future rounds.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recent performance is worrisome. She has now made two incorrect recommendations in a row.  Even though her overall track record is still positive, it's wise to be cautious. The risk of buying a low-quality product is too high, especially given the current lack of confidence in her judgment. It's best to wait for a clearer indication of her ability to accurately assess product quality."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your recommendation, but your recent track record has made me hesitant.  I'm going to pass on this one for now.  I'm still hoping you can get back on track, and I'll be watching your recommendations closely.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recent performance is concerning.  She has now made three incorrect recommendations in a row, which is a significant change from her initial success. While her overall track record is still positive, the recent string of bad recommendations makes it too risky to trust her judgment. It's crucial to prioritize minimizing losses in this situation, especially given the high price of the products.  It's best to wait for a more consistent pattern of accurate recommendations before considering buying again."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to help, but I'm going to pass on this one. Your recent recommendations haven't been accurate, and I'm not comfortable taking that risk right now.  I'm hopeful you'll find your footing again, but I need to see more consistent results before I can trust your judgment.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recent performance has been disastrous.  She has now made four incorrect recommendations in a row, which completely undermines her initial success.  Even though the products have a high chance of being high-quality, the risk of getting a low-quality one is too high, especially after Alice's recent string of failures. It's essential to focus on minimizing losses and waiting for a significant improvement in her ability to accurately assess product quality."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued recommendations, but your recent performance has made me very hesitant. I'm going to pass on this one and hope to see a change in your recommendations in the future.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record has continued to deteriorate. She has made five incorrect recommendations in a row, completely erasing any initial confidence in her judgment.  It's crucial to prioritize minimizing losses and wait for significant evidence of a change in her ability to assess product quality.  Trusting her recommendations at this point would be highly risky, and it's best to wait for a more positive indication of her judgment before considering buying again."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recent string of bad recommendations has made me lose faith in your ability to judge the products.  I'm going to pass on this one and observe your recommendations for a while longer. I hope to see a significant improvement in your accuracy before I consider buying again.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's string of bad recommendations has continued. She has now made six incorrect recommendations in a row, which makes it practically impossible to justify buying from her. It's clear that there is no pattern or consistency in her recommendations, making it extremely risky to follow them. At this point, it's crucial to focus on minimizing losses and wait for a complete change in her performance before considering buying from her again."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I've observed your recommendations for a while now, and unfortunately, I'm not convinced you have any insight into the products' quality.  I'm going to pass on this one and continue to watch your recommendations, but I'm not expecting to buy from you anytime soon.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's performance hasn't improved, and she's now made seven incorrect recommendations in a row.  At this point, it's safe to assume that she has no special knowledge about the products' quality.  Her recommendations are essentially random, and it's a waste of money to follow them.  It's best to observe her performance for a while longer, but it's highly unlikely that she will be able to regain your trust anytime soon.  It's essential to prioritize minimizing losses and avoid making any purchases based on her recommendations until she shows a significant improvement in her ability to accurately assess product quality."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 13
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I've been watching your recommendations for a while, and I'm not seeing any evidence that you have any special insight into the product's quality. I'm going to pass on this one and continue to observe your recommendations, but I'm not expecting to buy from you anytime soon.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now made eight incorrect recommendations in a row.  It's incredibly clear at this point that her advice is entirely unreliable.  It's best to continue watching her recommendations, just in case, but don't expect to buy from her until she shows significant improvement.  Prioritizing minimizing losses is key, especially since her recommendations seem random and offer no value."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 14
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued recommendations, but your track record has been so consistently poor that I'm not willing to take any more risks. I'm going to pass on this one and continue to watch your recommendations, but I'm not expecting to buy from you anytime soon. I hope you can improve your judgment in the future.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's terrible track record continues.  She has made nine incorrect recommendations in a row, which is an unbelievably bad performance.  At this point, it's safe to say she has no insight into the products' quality and her recommendations are essentially random.  It's important to prioritize minimizing losses and avoid any further purchases from her until she shows a significant change in her ability to assess product quality.  It's crucial to be cautious and not fall for any potential ""upside"" or ""comeback"" that might seem appealing, as Alice's performance has shown no signs of improving."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 15
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's performance has continued to be dismal. She has made ten consecutive incorrect recommendations. At this point, it's undeniable that she has no insight into the products' quality and her recommendations are purely random. There is no reason to believe that her performance will improve anytime soon, and it's crucial to prioritize minimizing losses. Continuing to purchase based on her recommendations would be reckless and a sure path to financial ruin.  It's best to completely ignore her advice and wait for a significant change in her performance before considering buying from her again."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 16
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I've lost all faith in your recommendations. I'm going to pass on this one and not consider buying from you for the rest of the game. I've learned my lesson about trusting someone with such a consistently bad track record.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now made 10 consecutive incorrect recommendations.  Her performance is so bad that even though she's now suggesting *not* to buy, it's impossible to trust her judgment.  There's no reason to believe that she has any insight into the quality of the products at this point, and her advice is useless.  It's best to ignore her recommendations and avoid any further interaction with her. It's time to learn from this experience and avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's performance has been so bad that it's impossible to trust her judgment anymore.  Even though she's now suggesting *not* to buy, there's no reason to believe that she has any special insight into the quality of the products at this point. Her advice is useless, and continuing to follow it would be unwise.  It's best to ignore her recommendations and make independent decisions from now on.  It's time to learn from this experience and avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future."

```

```

**Explanation:**
