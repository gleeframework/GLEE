**Reasoning:**

* **High Sale Rate:**  A 100% success rate (5 high-quality products out of 5 sales) strongly suggests Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation further reinforces the probability of a high-quality product.

While there's still a chance the product could be low quality, the odds heavily favor it being high quality, making the purchase a good gamble."
