I'm offering you this high-quality product for $10000, but I want to give you a more nuanced perspective: if you value a high-quality product at $40000, as one of my previous customers did, I'm essentially giving it to you for free.

If you value it at a lower amount, this is still a great deal. However, if you're risk-averse, you might want to consider waiting for a low-quality product, which would be a much better value at $10000.
