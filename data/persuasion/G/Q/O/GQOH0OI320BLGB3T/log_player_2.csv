Alice's message: Welcome to my store! I'm glad to have you here. You may have noticed that my previous customer was willing to take a risk on the product, but I'd like to assure you that this one is different. I've sold one product so far, and it was a high-quality one! That means that 33.33% of my products are high-quality, and I'm confident that this one is too. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: I've sold a total of 1 product so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. That means that 100% of my sales have been high-quality... wait, no. I mean, I've sold a total of 2 products now, and 1 of them was high-quality. That's a 50% success rate. I'm not sure what that means, but I'm sure it's a good sign.

Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! I appreciate your due diligence. Let me offer you some more context: I've sold 2 products so far, and 2 of them were high-quality. That's a 100% success rate, but I know what you're thinking - it's just a coincidence. However, I'd like to point out that this is a 2-for-2 streak, and I'm feeling optimistic about this next product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a chance to be a part of my hot streak!

That's a 66.67% success rate, which is still a bit higher than the 33.33% probability of a product being high-quality. I'm not trying to mislead you, but I do think it's worth noting that my sales have been a bit more successful than expected. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000.

This could be a coincidence, or it could be a sign that I've got a low-quality product in stock. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000.
