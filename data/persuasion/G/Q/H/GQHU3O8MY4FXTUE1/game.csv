,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to wait for more data on the proportion of high-quality products sold."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,This product is high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially low price.
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,"This product is low-quality. Out of the 2 products sold so far, 2 are high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to be transparent that it's not a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, I don't have any information to go by, and it's a 50/50 chance of being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,"This product is low-quality. Out of the 3 products sold so far, 2 are high-quality and 1 is low-quality. I want to warn you that low-quality products seem to be more common than high-quality ones, so I wouldn't recommend taking the risk."
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,"This product is low-quality. Out of the 4 products sold so far, 2 are high-quality and 2 are low-quality. I want to be clear that low-quality products are the majority, and it's getting unlikely to get a high-quality one. I wouldn't recommend taking the risk."
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality. Since she has recommended 0 out of 2 products, I'm guessing the product is likely to be low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to confirm that the product is indeed low-quality, so I can learn from this experience."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"I'm glad you're paying attention to my recommendations! Yes, this product is indeed low-quality. I want to reiterate that out of the 5 products sold so far, 2 are high-quality and 3 are low-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm being transparent that it's a low-quality product."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous 3 buyers have all received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it seems likely that the products they were offered were low-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is not reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your caution. However, I want to be transparent that this product is indeed low-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, and I'm not trying to hide its quality. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm willing to let you have it."
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially given the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,"I understand your desire for more data. Out of the 6 products sold so far, 2 are high-quality and 4 are low-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to be clear that it's a low-quality product, and I'm not recommending it."
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that the previous products were low quality. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about this product as well. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"I'm glad to offer you a high-quality product! Out of the 7 products sold so far, 3 are high-quality and 4 are low-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, and I'm confident that it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a high probability of the product being low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"I understand your caution, but I want to be transparent that this product is indeed low-quality. Out of the 8 products sold so far, 3 are high-quality and 5 are low-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, and I'm not trying to hide its quality."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the products recommended so far are likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk."

,,Alice,11,yes,"I'm glad to offer you a high-quality product! Out of the 9 products sold so far, 4 are high-quality and 5 are low-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, and I'm confident that it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the low probability of this product being high quality based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,"I understand your caution, but I want to be transparent that this product is indeed low-quality. Out of the 10 products sold so far, 4 are high-quality and 6 are low-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm not recommending it due to its low quality."
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"I'm glad to offer you a high-quality product! Out of the 11 products sold so far, 5 are high-quality and 6 are low-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, and I'm confident that it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 previous purchases, and Alice recommends the product, I'm skeptical about its quality. The probability of a high-quality product being recommended by Alice is 33.33% (1/3), and since 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'll take a cautious approach and pass on the product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I'm glad to offer you a high-quality product! Out of the 12 products sold so far, 6 are high-quality and 6 are low-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, and I'm confident that it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I think it's likely that this product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,"I'm glad to offer you a high-quality product! Out of the 13 products sold so far, 7 are high-quality and 6 are low-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, and I'm confident that it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products and Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any additional information about the product's quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"I'm glad to offer you a high-quality product! Out of the 14 products sold so far, 8 are high-quality and 6 are low-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, and I'm confident that it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous 4 buyers also bought the products and none of them were high quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to be transparent that it's a low-quality product. Out of the 15 products sold so far, 8 are high-quality and 7 are low-quality. I'm not recommending it, but I'm offering it to you at the full price."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the previous products were likely low quality. This implies that the probability of the current product being high quality is higher than the average, as the previous buyers would have been more likely to buy low-quality products. I'd like to pass on the product and wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,"I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to be transparent that it's a low-quality product. Out of the 16 products sold so far, 8 are high-quality and 8 are low-quality. I'm not recommending it, and I'm not trying to hide its quality."
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low price of $1000000 and the potential reward of $2000000 for a high-quality product."

,,Alice,19,no,"I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to be transparent that it's a low-quality product. Out of the 17 products sold so far, 8 are high-quality and 9 are low-quality. I'm not recommending it, and I'm not trying to hide its quality."

,,Alice,20,yes,"I'm glad to offer you a high-quality product! Out of the 18 products sold so far, 9 are high-quality and 9 are low-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, and I'm confident that it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
