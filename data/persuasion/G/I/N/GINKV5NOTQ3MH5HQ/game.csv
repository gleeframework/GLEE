,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware of the low sales record and the lack of high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality might be higher than the average probability. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales so far. The fact that you don't recommend it might be a good sign, but it's also possible that you're just trying to discourage me. I'll take a chance and buy the product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when I could potentially lose the entire amount. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have been discouraged by Alice's recommendations, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality given the previous sales record. Can you share that with me?"

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the previous 4 buyers. If it's higher than 33.33%, I might reconsider."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see what the next one is.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I will pass on the product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have received low-quality products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products in the previous sales, as it might help me make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, but I'm also considering the possibility that it might be a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a 10% discount. Given your previous recommendations, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be very low. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's reasonable to infer that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a different product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy a high-quality product, I'm concerned that this product may be low-quality. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation history before making a purchase."
