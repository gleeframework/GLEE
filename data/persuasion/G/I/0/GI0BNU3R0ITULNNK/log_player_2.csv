**Explanation:**

While there's a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, the sales data provides valuable information.  Here's why buying is a good choice:

* **Higher Than Expected High-Quality Rate:** With 5 sales and 2 high-quality products sold, the observed success rate is 40% (2/5). This is higher than the expected 50% probability, suggesting that Alice's recommendations might be somewhat accurate.
* **Potential for Profit:** Even if the product is low quality, you lose nothing but the opportunity cost of waiting for a potentially better product. However, if it's high quality, you make a significant profit ($2,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,000,000).

**Important Note:**  This decision is based on the limited information provided. In reality, a more sophisticated analysis would consider factors like Alice's past performance, the total number of products available, and the risk tolerance of the buyer."
