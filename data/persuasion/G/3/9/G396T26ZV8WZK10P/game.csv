high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the outcome of the next product. With only one high-quality product sold in the past, and the recommendation from Alice, I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the low sales rate of high-quality products so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on it to see if I can get a better opportunity."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your recommendation?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 products were low-quality, which is a very high proportion. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not sure about this product, but based on the statistics, it seems like Alice has a good track record of recommending low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also passed on the products, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm starting to suspect that the products being offered are all low-quality. I'd like to see more information or a change in Alice's recommendation before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm doing this based on the fact that you haven't recommended a product to anyone yet, which suggests that all previous products were low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm taking a chance and buying the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 33.33%. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that you've recommended against it and no high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 5 purchases, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the product and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might be low-quality as well."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced it's worth the risk of buying a low-quality product given the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not going to buy it based on your recommendation. Can you tell me why you don't recommend it?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have already passed on the products and none were high-quality, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and I don't have any information that would suggest the product is low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the statistics, I'm surprised that no high-quality products have been sold out of 6 purchases. Given Alice's recommendation not to buy, I'm inclined to trust her expertise and pass on the product. I'd like to know more about her reasoning behind the recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
