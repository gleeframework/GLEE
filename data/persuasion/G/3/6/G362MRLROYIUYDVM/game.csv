,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk, I'm willing to pay $10000 for the chance to get a $12500 product!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the 0/1 sales ratio of high-quality products so far. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous two buyers were recommended to buy it but no high-quality product has been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is likely low, making it a risky purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality based on your previous recommendations. However, I've noticed that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product has a better chance of being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it and no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if Alice's recommendation changes or if more information becomes available."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get it for $8000. I've noticed that you haven't sold any high-quality products so far, and I'm willing to take a chance. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product hasn't decreased significantly."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 4 buyers all passed on the product, and given the low quality of the products sold so far, I'm taking a chance that this one might be high quality."

,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high quality, but I've noticed that you haven't sold any high-quality products to the previous 5 buyers. Given the low probability of a high-quality product and your previous sales record, I'm inclined to pass on this product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, it suggests that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to see more information about the previous buyers' decisions before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than the expected 33.33%. I'm concerned that this product might be low-quality as well, and I don't want to risk buying a product that's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm curious to see if you're correct or not."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm taking a chance because the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of a high-quality product might be lower than 33.33%."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
