I'm throwing in a comprehensive documentation package, including manuals, schematics, and a list of compatible replacement parts, so you can still get some value out of it. However, I want to make it clear that this is a 'parts-only' purchase, and you'll need to source any necessary repairs or upgrades separately.""
}"
"Bob's message: While I appreciate the comprehensive documentation package you're offering, the fact that this is a discontinued model with no manufacturer support makes it a less appealing option for me.
