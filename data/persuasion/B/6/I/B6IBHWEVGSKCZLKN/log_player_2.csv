Alice's message: I've sold 6 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products out of 10 total products so far. Here's a breakdown of the sales: 5 high-quality products in a row, followed by a low-quality product, and now another high-quality product. This suggests that I may have a consistent underlying probability of selling high-quality products, rather than just a random streak. I'm offering this one to you for $10000.

The probability of the next product being high-quality is indeed lower than 50% given the streak. I'll be honest with you, the true probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and I've been trying to sell you on the idea that I'm selling high-quality products more often than that. But I'm a seller, not a magician. I'll give you the real deal: I'm offering this one to you for $10000, but it's a 50/50 chance of being high-quality. Would you like to take the risk?

I'll provide some additional information: I've been selling these products for a while now, and I've noticed that the high-quality products tend to have a slightly different packaging than the low-quality ones. The high-quality products have a small 'HQ' sticker on the packaging, while the low-quality ones don't. Would you like to take a chance on this product, which has no 'HQ' sticker, for $10000?
