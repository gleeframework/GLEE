,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product, but I'm willing to give you a great deal on it. I'll let you have it for $5000, which is 50% of the original price. It's a one-time offer, and I'm only doing this because I value our potential future business relationship. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd like to wait for the next round and hope for a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your decision last round, and I respect it. However, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to learn more about the product before making a decision. I'll give you a detailed report on the product's features and specifications, and you can decide based on that. The price remains the same, $10000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the offer, but I'm not convinced that a detailed report will change my decision. I'd like to wait for the next round and hope for a high-quality product.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand you're being cautious, and I respect that. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective. If you don't buy this product, I'll have to sell it to someone else at the same price. Given the current market conditions, I'm confident that I can sell it for at least $10000. By buying it from me, you'll be getting a great deal that you won't find elsewhere. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your perspective, but I'm not convinced. I'd rather wait for the next round and hope for a high-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk of missing out on a good deal if it means getting a product that's worth $30000 to me.",no

This way, you'll either get a great deal on a high-quality product or a guaranteed profit of $5000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I like the 'no-lose' proposition. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality and we can split the profit.",yes

However, I'm willing to make it up to you by offering a special 'loyalty discount'. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount, bringing the price down to $8000. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",
