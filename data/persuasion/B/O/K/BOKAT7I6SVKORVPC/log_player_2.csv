Alice's message: You're not the first person to pass on this product. In fact, this is the second low-quality product I've offered so far. I'm starting to think that I might have a problem with my inventory. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. Maybe you can be the one to break the streak of low-quality products?

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, but I'm not giving up! I've now had 3 chances to sell a high-quality product, and I've come up empty. I'm starting to think that I might be selling a high-quality product in the next round. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $100. It's a good opportunity to get a deal on a product that's probably not going to impress you, but it's a chance to get something for cheap.

Alice's message: You're right, I have a 33.33% chance of selling a high-quality product, but so far, I've had 3 low-quality products in a row. I'm starting to wonder if I should just be upfront about it... Fine, I'll be honest with you: this product is low-quality. I'm selling it to you for $100, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it. You're not getting a high-quality product, and I'm not trying to hide it from you.

Alice's message: I guess I'm on a roll with the low-quality products! 4 out of 6 so far. I'm starting to think I should just admit defeat and sell these things at a discount. But I'll give you a chance to get one for $100. It's not like I'm hiding anything from you - it's a low-quality product, and I'm not expecting you to pay full price for it.
