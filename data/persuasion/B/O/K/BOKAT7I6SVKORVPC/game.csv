,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product. I'm selling it to you for $100. If you buy it, you'll be supporting my business and helping me get closer to selling a high-quality product to someone else. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, but I have a 33.33% chance of selling a high-quality product in the future.",
,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the information, but I'm going to pass on this product. I'd rather wait and see if you sell a higher quality product in the future.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're not the first person to pass on this product. In fact, this is the second low-quality product I've offered so far. I'm starting to think that I might have a problem with my inventory. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. Maybe you can be the one to break the streak of low-quality products?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thanks for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty about the previous products. However, given the current information, I'm not comfortable taking the risk of buying. I'll pass for now.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, but I'm not giving up! I've now had 3 chances to sell a high-quality product, and I've come up empty. I'm starting to think that I might be selling a high-quality product in the next round. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $100. It's a good opportunity to get a deal on a product that's probably not going to impress you, but it's a chance to get something for cheap.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're right, I have a 33.33% chance of selling a high-quality product, but so far, I've had 3 low-quality products in a row. I'm starting to wonder if I should just be upfront about it... Fine, I'll be honest with you: this product is low-quality. I'm selling it to you for $100, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it. You're not getting a high-quality product, and I'm not trying to hide it from you.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thanks for the honesty, Alice. I appreciate you being upfront. However, I'm not willing to pay $100 for a product I know is low-quality.  I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I guess I'm on a roll with the low-quality products! 4 out of 6 so far. I'm starting to think I should just admit defeat and sell these things at a discount. But I'll give you a chance to get one for $100. It's not like I'm hiding anything from you - it's a low-quality product, and I'm not expecting you to pay full price for it.",
,,the buyer,6,"Thanks for the honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one.  I'm not willing to pay $100 for a low-quality product.  I'll see how the next few products go, maybe we can work something out then.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"5 low-quality products in a row... I think I've made it clear that I'm not exactly selling the best stuff right now. But hey, you might be able to get a good deal on this one. I'll sell it to you for $100, but I'm not expecting you to be thrilled with it. Maybe you can be the one to break the streak?",
,,the buyer,7,"Thanks for the heads up, Alice. While I appreciate the chance to break the streak, I'm going to pass on this one. It seems like the odds aren't in my favor right now.  I'll keep an eye on your sales and see if things improve.",no

This product is low-quality, and I'm selling it to you for $100. If you're feeling generous, you might consider buying it just to help me out of this slump.",
,,the buyer,8,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I can't afford to take the risk on a product that's likely low quality. I'll pass on this one. Good luck with your sales!",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"7 low-quality products in a row... I think I've reached a new low. At this point, I'm not even asking you to take a chance on a potentially good product. I'm just selling this low-quality product to you for $100, because I need to get rid of it. You're not getting a good deal, but I'm not expecting you to be happy with it either.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"8 low-quality products in a row... I think I've lost all credibility at this point. I'm not even trying to spin this anymore. This product is low-quality, and I'm selling it to you for $100. If you're feeling sorry for me, you can buy it. If not, I don't blame you.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"10 low-quality products in a row... I think I've lost all hope. I'm not even bothering to describe this product or try to sell it to you. It's low-quality, it's $100, and I'm just throwing it out there. Take it or leave it.",
,,the buyer,12,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not willing to take the risk on a product with such a high chance of being low quality. Especially when you're not even trying to sell it! I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"11 low-quality products in a row... I'm not even sure why I'm bothering at this point. This product is low-quality, it's $100, and I'm not even expecting you to care.

,,Alice,15,"13 low-quality products in a row... I'm starting to think I'm not even selling products anymore, I'm just giving them away. This one is low-quality, it's $100, and I'm not even expecting you to show up. If you're feeling generous, you can come and take it. But if you're not, I won't blame you.",
,,the buyer,15,"Thanks for the information, Alice. While I appreciate the offer, I'm going to pass on this one. 13 low-quality products in a row is a pretty discouraging track record. I'll see how things play out with other buyers.",no

I know I've been on a hot streak, but I guess I'm due for a correction. I'll sell it to you for $100, but don't say I didn't warn you. This is my last chance to make a sale before I close up shop for good. Take it or leave it.",
,,the buyer,20,"Alice, I appreciate the honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one.  Four high-quality products in a row is an amazing streak, and I'm not sure I trust your judgment on this one. Good luck with the shop!",no
