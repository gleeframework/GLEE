Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you at a significant discount from its true value, but I need you to take a chance on it. If you buy it, you'll be getting an incredible deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to take a chance on a product without knowing its quality. Can you tell me what the probability of it being high-quality is?""

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your caution. As we've established, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm willing to offer you this product at the same price of $1000000, but I want to assure you that the price is not a reflection of its quality. This product is a great opportunity to get a feel for the product line, and I'm confident you'll be able to evaluate its value accurately. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to share the probability, but I'm not going to take a chance on a low-quality product that would be worthless to me. I'll only consider buying if I can be sure it's high-quality.""

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to offer you a compromise.

This way, you can take advantage of the 66.67% chance that you'll get a valuable product, and you'll have a safety net in case it's not what you expected. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the guarantee, but it doesn't change the fact that I don't know whether the product is high-quality or not. I'm not willing to take a chance on a low-quality product, even with a refund guarantee.""

If it's high-quality, you'll know it and can buy it for $1000000. If it's low-quality, I'll tell you that too, and you can walk away. You'll have all the information you need to make a decision. What do you say?

This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a significant discount. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the transparency, but I'm not going to pay $1,000,000 for a product that's worth $1,250,000 to me. I'd rather wait for a better deal or a chance to negotiate the price.""

Round 11
Alice's message: I understand your perspective, and I respect your decision. However, I want to ask you to consider the bigger picture. If you don't buy this product, it means I'll have to keep it on my inventory, and I'll have to try to sell it to someone else. You've already seen the low-quality products I've offered, and I'm not sure who else would be interested.
