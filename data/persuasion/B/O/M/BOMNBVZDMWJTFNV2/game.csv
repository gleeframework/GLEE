,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your recommendation and the current statistics. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the low number of sales and the fact that you're not recommending the product, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. I'll pass on this one."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5, which is not significantly different from the expected probability of 0.5.
