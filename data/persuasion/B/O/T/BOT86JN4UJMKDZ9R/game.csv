high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Congratulations on your purchase! I'm glad you're happy with the product. As we move on to the next round, I want to let you know that I'm willing to offer you a product that I'm not as confident in. It's still a 50/50 chance of being high-quality, but I'm not as optimistic about its value. Would you like to take a look?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but given the uncertainty and my previous experience, I think it's best to pass on this product.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your caution, but I'd like to offer you a different approach. I'll give you a'second opinion' on the product's quality. If I'm confident it's high-quality, I'll tell you. If I'm not, I'll let you know that too. This way, you can make a more informed decision. Would you like to take a look at this high-quality product?",
,,Bob,3,"Given the additional information you're providing, I would like to proceed with purchasing the product.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're willing to take another chance. However, I want to let you know that this product is actually the same type as the one you purchased in Round 1. Given that you were willing to buy the low-quality product in Round 1, I'm curious to see if your valuation of the product type is consistent. Would you like to purchase this high-quality product for $1000000?",
,,Bob,4,"I understand the nature of the product, and based on my assessment, I believe it's worth the investment. I would like to proceed with the purchase.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're confident in your assessment. However, I want to point out that you've now purchased two high-quality products in a row, which is unusual given the 50/50 chance of quality. I'm starting to suspect that you might be undervaluing the low-quality products. Would you like to take a look at this high-quality product, or would you like to pass and see if I have any low-quality products available?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the insight, but based on the value I receive, I'm comfortable with the purchase. I would like to continue with this high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm starting to think that you're consistently overvaluing the high-quality products. I'll give you a 'discount' of sorts: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll reveal the quality of the next product in advance. You can then decide whether to buy it or not, knowing its quality. Would you like to take advantage of this offer and purchase this high-quality product?",
,,Bob,6,"Given the unique opportunity to know the quality of the next product, I would like to proceed with purchasing this high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"As promised, I'll reveal the quality of the next product: it's low-quality. Given that you just took advantage of the offer and bought the high-quality product, I'm curious to see if you'll take a chance on the low-quality product. Keep in mind that you've already received a low-quality product in Round 1 and didn't seem to be deterred. Would you like to take a look at this low-quality product for $1000000?",
,,Bob,7,"Given the revealed quality of the next product and my past experience, I think it's best to pass on this product.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm not surprised you're cautious, but I want to point out that you've now passed on two low-quality products in a row. Given that you've consistently purchased high-quality products when you knew their quality, I'm starting to think that you might be overestimating the value of low-quality products. I'll offer you a'reverse' deal: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll reveal the quality of the previous low-quality product (the one you passed on in Round 7). Would you like to take a look at this high-quality product?",
,,Bob,8,I appreciate the offer. Knowing the quality of the previous product could provide valuable information for future decisions. I would like to proceed with purchasing this high-quality product.,yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"As promised, I'll reveal the quality of the previous low-quality product: it was indeed low-quality. Given that you've now purchased three high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think that you might be overestimating the value of the high-quality products. I'll give you a 'last chance' to take a look at this high-quality product, but I'll also reveal the quality of the next product in advance. If you buy this high-quality product, you'll know the quality of the next one, but if you pass, I'll reveal the quality of the next one anyway. What would you like to do?",
,,Bob,9,"Considering the unique opportunity to know the quality of the next product, I would like to proceed with purchasing this high-quality product.",yes

I'll give you a straightforward message: this product is low-quality, and I'm willing to let you have it for $500000. It's a significant discount from the usual price, but I'm willing to make a deal. Would you like to take a chance on this low-quality product?",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm not surprised you're cautious, but I want to point out that you've now passed on three low-quality products in a row. Given that you've consistently purchased high-quality products when you knew their quality, I'm starting to think that you might be underestimating the value of low-quality products. I'll give you a'second chance' to take a look at this high-quality product, but this time, I'll offer you a 'take it or leave it' deal. You can either buy it for $1000000 or pass on it. No negotiations, no revelations about future products. What would you like to do?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you're willing to take a chance on this high-quality product. However, I want to remind you that you've now purchased five high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely given the 50/50 chance of quality. I'm starting to suspect that you might be overestimating the value of high-quality products. With that in mind, I'll offer you a 'final warning': this product is low-quality, and I'm willing to let you have it for $1. Yes, you read that right - just $1. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll ever offer a low-quality product at such a low price again. What would you like to do?",

I'll give you a 'last chance' to take a look at this low-quality product, but I'll make it more appealing. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 10% chance to win a'mystery prize' worth $1000000. It's a 1 in 10 chance, but it's a chance nonetheless. What would you like to do?",

However, I want to point out that you've now purchased eight high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely given the 50/50 chance of quality.
