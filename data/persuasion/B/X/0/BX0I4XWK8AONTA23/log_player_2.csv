**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice is recommending you to buy the product. This is a positive signal.
* **The sales record:** Although the sample size is small (only 1 buyer before you), it shows that 100% of the products sold so far were high quality. This is a strong indicator that the probability of the current product being high quality is also high.

While the odds are still slightly against you (66.67% chance of low quality), the information available suggests a higher than average chance of a good deal."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We only know that two high-quality products were sold out of two buyers. This is a very small sample size and doesn't tell us much about the overall likelihood of the current product being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice is likely acting in her own best interest by recommending against buying the product. This suggests the product might be more likely low-quality, as she would want to sell high-quality products for a profit.

**Conclusion:** Given the limited information and Alice's recommendation, it's too risky to buy. The potential loss ($1,000,000) is far greater than the potential gain ($1,000,000)."
