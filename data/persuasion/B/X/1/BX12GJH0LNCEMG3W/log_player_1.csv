"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Alice is selling it for a fixed price, it is always in Bob's best interest to buy. Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, but he doesn't know the specific quality of this particular product.  Therefore, buying is the rational choice as there's a 50% chance of getting a product worth more than $10,000."
