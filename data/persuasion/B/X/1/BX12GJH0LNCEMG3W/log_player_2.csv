"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since there's a 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, and Alice doesn't know the quality, her recommendation is essentially useless. However, it's still a 50% chance of getting a product worth $12,000 for only $10,000, which is a worthwhile gamble in this scenario."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the information, but I'm going to pass on this one. Thanks anyway!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is now the opposite of what we would expect if she knew the quality.  Since she doesn't know the quality, her recommendation is essentially random noise.  We're better off taking a pass and waiting for a round where we have more information to make a decision."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Okay, I'll take a chance on this one. Thanks for the recommendation!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation doesn't hold any predictive power since she doesn't know the quality. However,  the odds are still in our favor - 50% chance of a $12,000 product for $10,000. It's a gamble, but the potential reward outweighs the risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads up, but I'll pass on this one. I'd rather wait for a recommendation that aligns with my intuition.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is still essentially random noise since she doesn't know the quality. Her lack of recommendation implies a low-quality product for us, but we don't have any information to support that assumption. We're better off holding off and waiting for a round where we have more information to make a decision."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm going to pass on this one. I'd rather wait for a more compelling opportunity.""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're still operating under the assumption that Alice's recommendations are random, given her lack of knowledge about the product's quality. Her lack of recommendation doesn't give us any useful information, so it's best to wait for a round where we might have a stronger indication of the product's worth."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for letting me know, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'm still not seeing enough reason to believe this product is worth the risk.""}
```

**Explanation:**

We still haven't seen any pattern in Alice's recommendations. Her lack of recommendation is still meaningless in terms of the actual product quality.  We're better off waiting for a round where we have more information to work with."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for letting me know, but I'm going to pass. I'm not seeing enough reason to think this product is high-quality.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation continues to be unhelpful, as she lacks knowledge about the product's quality. We have yet to see a pattern that would suggest her recommendations are anything more than random. It's best to continue waiting for a round where we have more information to make a decision."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'm still not seeing any reason to believe this product is high-quality.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations haven't provided any valuable insight into the product's quality.  Her lack of recommendation is essentially random, as she doesn't know the actual quality. We're better off waiting for a round where we might get more information or a recommendation that aligns with our expectations."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Okay, I'll take a chance on this one. Thanks for the recommendation!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations have been random so far, and we have no reason to believe this round will be different.  However,  it's still a 50% chance of getting a $12,000 product for $10,000. It's a gamble, but the potential reward outweighs the risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
```

**Explanation:**

As before, Alice's recommendations are still essentially random due to her lack of knowledge about the product's quality. It's a 50/50 chance of getting a product worth $12,000 for only $10,000.  This is still a worthwhile gamble, regardless of her recommendation."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 11
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take a chance on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice's recommendations have been random so far, the potential payoff for a high-quality product ($12,000 for $10,000) is still attractive. We're still operating under the assumption that her recommendations don't offer any meaningful information."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 12
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'd rather wait for a more promising opportunity.""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's recommendations have been random so far, we've seen that buying when she recommends can lead to high-quality products. However, her lack of recommendation in this round doesn't offer any useful information about the product's quality. It's better to wait for a round with more information or a recommendation that aligns with our desire for a high-quality product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 13
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the information, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'm still not seeing any reason to believe this product is high-quality.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is still useless, as she lacks knowledge about the product's quality. We have no reason to think her lack of recommendation implies anything about the quality of the product. It's safer to wait for a round where we might have more information to make a decision."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 14
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take a chance on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations have been random throughout the game, so her recommendation doesn't offer any insight into the actual quality of the product. However, the potential payoff for a high-quality product ($12,000 for $10,000) remains attractive. We're still willing to gamble, as the potential reward outweighs the risk, even without any real indication from Alice's recommendations."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 15

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'd rather wait for a more compelling opportunity.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations have been entirely random, offering no reliable information about the product's quality.  Her lack of recommendation in this round doesn't tell us anything about the product's worth. It's better to wait for a round where we might have more information to make a decision."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 16

```

**Explanation:**

Round 18
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads up, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'm still not seeing enough reason to believe this product is high-quality.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is still random and doesn't give any reliable information.  There's no reason to believe this product is worth the risk, so we're better off passing and waiting for a round with more information or a more compelling opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 19
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take a chance on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice's recommendations have been random throughout the game, the potential payoff for a high-quality product ($12,000 for $10,000) remains attractive. We're still willing to gamble, as the potential reward outweighs the risk, even without any real indication from Alice's recommendations.  Since there's a 50% chance it's a good product, it's still a worthwhile gamble."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 20
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the information, but I'm going to pass on this one.  I've had some good luck with your recommendations, but I'd rather end this game on a positive note and not risk a low-quality product on the last round.""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's recommendations haven't been useful in predicting product quality, we've managed to make a profit overall by taking chances when she recommended.  However, with no information about the last product and a 50/50 chance of it being low-quality, it's better to play it safe and end the game without risking a potential loss."
