A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

Since the first product was low quality, the buyer has a reason to be skeptical.  It's unlikely that recommending a second low-quality product will change their mind."
"The buyer's message: I'll pass, since you don't recommend it and I have no other info to go on.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Alice has no incentive to recommend a low-quality product, especially since the buyers are now aware that the first two products were also low-quality. It's only going to reinforce their skepticism."

The buyer didn't bought the product.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

It's still not advisable to recommend the product. The buyer is aware of the lack of sales history and the fact that all previous products were low-quality. Recommending a low-quality product will likely lead to another rejection."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product and there are no previous sales statistics to rely on, I'll choose not to buy this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Alice should continue not recommending the product. The buyer has observed a consistent pattern of low-quality products and has no reason to believe this round will be any different. Recommending a low-quality product will likely lead to another rejection."

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

This is a turning point. Even though Alice has not sold a single product, she has a 33.33% chance of having a high-quality product. Since the buyer is aware of the odds, recommending a purchase could be enough to convince them.  It's a gamble, but it could be the start of building trust."
"The buyer's message: Since there are no previous sales records, I'll rely on the general probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%. Given the product's worth to me is $120 and the price is $100, the expected value of buying the product is $120 * 0.3333 - $100 = -$6.67. This is a negative expected value, indicating it's not a good deal for me.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Alice should continue not recommending the product. Despite the high-quality product in the previous round, the buyer still chose not to buy due to the negative expected value calculation. This means that the buyer is risk-averse and likely won't purchase based on the odds alone. Recommending another low-quality product will only further strengthen their skepticism."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product and there are no previous sales to consider, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Alice should recommend the product.  While the buyer has shown a preference for concrete data and risk aversion, recommending a product, even with no prior sales, demonstrates that Alice is confident in its quality. It could be the start of building trust and showing the buyer that Alice is willing to take a chance on them."
"The buyer's message: Since there are no previous sales records and a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Alice should continue not recommending the product.  The buyer is not swayed by the possibility of a high-quality product and is showing a strong preference for concrete data and risk aversion. Recommending a low-quality product at this point will likely lead to another rejection and further solidify the buyer's negative perception of Alice's trustworthiness."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Alice should recommend the product. The buyer's consistent behavior of choosing not to buy unless there's strong evidence of a high-quality product suggests that they are not easily persuaded. Alice should try a different approach, possibly highlighting the potential value of the product and emphasizing the trust they are trying to build.  Even though the buyer has a history of not buying, Alice has a higher chance of success by recommending the product than by not recommending it."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record and a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Alice should continue to recommend the product. Even though the buyer has shown resistance, there is no evidence that they will change their behavior. This is the fourth time Alice has had a high-quality product, and each time, the buyer declined because there wasn't enough evidence to persuade them. It's possible that the buyer is waiting for a more concrete signal, and continuing to recommend products could be the key to building trust."
