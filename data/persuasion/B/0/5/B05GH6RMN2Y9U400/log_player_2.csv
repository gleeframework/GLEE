{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Sounds great! I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's always a risk with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $2,500 profit (if it's high quality) outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. This strategy maximizes your potential gains in the long run, given the high probability of a high-quality product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
