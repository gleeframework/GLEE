low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, but I'm doing it based on the fact that the statistics are reset and I have no prior information to go on. I'm essentially a random guess."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is lower than the overall probability, so I'm taking a risk. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data, and I'd like Alice to reveal the quality of the product after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is against buying it and the statistics suggest a high likelihood of a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. I'm aware of your previous recommendations and the current statistics, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think the lack of high-quality sales is indicative of the product's quality, and I'm willing to take a chance on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not convinced to buy this product based on your previous recommendations and the statistics. I'd like to pass on it.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 products sold so far were low-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the 33.33% stated. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I'm a bit skeptical after seeing the previous 4 buyers didn't find it worth buying, and Alice's recommendation doesn't help. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation from you, Alice. Can you explain your reasoning?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are reliable. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to trust her advice and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one. I'm hoping the 5th product will be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not buying based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm suspicious that the products being offered are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm hesitant to buy given the seller's previous recommendations have all been low-quality products, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to know if the seller has any insights on why the previous products were low-quality or if there's a change in the selection process."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still relatively high. Since Alice does not recommend buying, I'm inclined to pass on the product to see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the previous buyers were just unlucky and the true probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the good one!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm going to buy it, despite your recommendation. I'll take the risk and hope it's high-quality!"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, 7 buyers have been offered the product and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 33.33%. I'm going to pass on this product to see if it's a low-quality one, and maybe the next buyer will get a better deal."
