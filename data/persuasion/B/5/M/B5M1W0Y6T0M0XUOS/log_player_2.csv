They were a bit hesitant at first, but after crunching the numbers and considering the statistics, they decided to take a chance and make it theirs. And I'm happy to report that they're thrilled with their purchase! As for their decision-making process, they were a data-driven buyer who wanted to make an informed decision based on the numbers. They asked me a lot of questions and did their own calculations before making a decision. Would you like to follow in their footsteps and take a chance on this high-quality product?

Alright, let me give you the probability: with 9 high-quality products out of 12 sold, the probability of this specific product being high-quality is 9/12, or 75%.
