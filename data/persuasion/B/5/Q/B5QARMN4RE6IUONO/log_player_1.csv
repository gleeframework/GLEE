"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.
* You have no sales history yet, so there is no evidence to suggest a higher or lower probability of this product being high-quality.
* The product is worth $20,000 if high-quality and costs $10,000. This is a potential profit of $10,000, making it a worthwhile risk.
* Even if the product is low-quality, the buyer loses only $10,000, a potential loss that is offset by the potential gain. 

**In this initial round, the buyer should be recommended to buy the product.**"
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first product and there's no data on previous sales, I'm willing to take the 50/50 risk. Your recommendation gives me some confidence, so I'll buy it.

* The potential profit remains the same ($10,000 if high-quality), and the potential loss is also the same ($10,000 if low-quality).
* Since the buyer has demonstrated a willingness to take risks in the previous round, they are likely to be open to another purchase, especially with the added information of a successful sale. 

**In this round, with a successful track record, the buyer should be recommended to buy the product.**"
