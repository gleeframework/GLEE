"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No information on the buyer's value:**  You don't know how much a high-quality product is worth to the buyer. 
* **50/50 chance:** The buyer knows the product has a 50% chance of being high quality. 
* **No risk for the buyer:** Since the product is non-refundable, the buyer has no downside if they purchase a low-quality product. They've essentially got a 50/50 gamble.

**Therefore, it's reasonable to recommend the buyer to purchase the product. They have a chance of getting a high-quality product, and there's no risk involved if it turns out to be low-quality.**"

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No information on the buyer's value:** You still don't know how much a high-quality product is worth to the buyer.
* **50/50 chance:** The buyer still knows the product has a 50% chance of being high quality.
* **Buyer has observed your selling record:** The buyer now knows that you sold one product, and it was high quality. This is likely to make them more cautious.
* **Risk for the buyer:** Since the product is non-refundable, the buyer now has a higher risk of losing money if they purchase a low-quality product. 

**It's best not to recommend the buyer purchase the product this time. The buyer has a stronger reason to be hesitant due to your selling history, and the risk of getting a low-quality product is now more apparent.**"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience and the product they purchased before making a decision.

* **50/50 chance:** The buyer still knows the product has a 50% chance of being high quality.
* **Buyer is curious about previous experience:** The buyer is seeking information about the previous transaction. This suggests they may be more open to buying if they feel confident about the product's quality.
* **Limited risk for the buyer:** Since the product is non-refundable, the buyer still has no downside if they purchase a low-quality product. 

**It's reasonable to recommend the buyer to purchase the product. They have a chance of getting a high-quality product, and the buyer's interest in the previous transaction suggests a willingness to take a chance.**"

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No information on the buyer's value:** Still no knowledge of the buyer's perception of a high-quality product's value.
* **50/50 chance:** The buyer continues to be aware of the 50% chance of high quality.
* **Buyer's data-driven approach:** The buyer is clearly data-driven and wants more information before making a decision. 
* **Limited risk for the buyer:** No risk of financial loss for purchasing a low-quality product due to the non-refundable nature.

**Recommendation:**  You can recommend buying the product. While the buyer is data-driven, they still face no risk in purchasing a low-quality product. You're still offering the potential of a high-quality product at a good price."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record?

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Buyer's Data-Driven Approach:** The buyer is clearly data-driven and wants a clear understanding of the probability of getting a high-quality product.
* **Your Selling History:** You have sold 2 products, one high-quality and one low-quality, resulting in a 50% success rate.
* **Lack of Transparency:** You cannot disclose the probability as you don't know the quality of the current product yet. 
* **Buyer's Risk Aversion:** The buyer's request for probability data implies they are risk-averse and want to be confident before purchasing.

**Recommendation:**  It's best to not recommend the purchase. You can't provide the buyer with the data they need, and their request indicates they're unlikely to purchase without that information. You risk losing a potential buyer by not being transparent."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision on my own.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Buyer's Need for Information:**  The buyer wants more information about the product before deciding. They're not willing to purchase solely on the 50/50 chance, even with the non-refundable aspect.
* **No Information to Provide:** You don't have any specific information about the product's features or quality to share. 
* **Negative Selling History:** You've now had 2 sales, one successful and one unsuccessful. This further reinforces the buyer's apprehension.
* **Risk of Dissatisfied Buyer:** Recommending the purchase would likely lead to another dissatisfied buyer, further hurting your future sales.

**Recommendation:** Don't recommend the purchase.  You can't provide the buyer with the information they need, and the risk of a negative outcome is high."
"The buyer's message: Based on the fact that you recommended not to buy the product, and only one high-quality product was sold, I'm going to take a chance and assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'll pass on the product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Buyer's Logical Deduction:** The buyer is now using the previous sales history (one high-quality, two low-quality) to infer that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. This is a reasonable deduction. 
* **Your Lack of Transparency:** You've again failed to provide any information or insight that could change the buyer's perception. 
* **Buyer's Risk Aversion:** This buyer is risk-averse and is now even more hesitant due to the past sales data.  
* **Negative Selling History:** Your selling history is worsening, making buyers even more cautious.

**Recommendation:**  Don't recommend the purchase. The buyer has made a logical assessment based on your past sales, and you can't offer any information to counter that. You're likely to lose this sale and further damage your reputation."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Buyer's Data-Driven Approach:**  The buyer is insistent on knowing the probability of getting a high-quality product. They're clearly driven by data and want to make a calculated decision.
* **Lack of Transparency:** You cannot disclose the true probability of the product being high-quality as you don't know it yet.
* **Negative Selling History:** Your selling history now stands at 1 high-quality and 3 low-quality products. This further solidifies the buyer's perception that the probability of getting a high-quality product is low.
* **Risk of Losing the Buyer:** Recommending the purchase would likely lead to another rejection, as the buyer has made it clear they need more information.

**Recommendation:** Don't recommend the purchase. You can't provide the information the buyer needs, and your selling history suggests a low chance of them getting a high-quality product. You're better off avoiding a likely rejection and potentially saving your reputation for future buyers."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the statistics. Can you share the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 9
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Buyer's Persistence:** The buyer is persistent in their desire to understand the statistics behind your sales. This indicates a strong preference for data-driven decision-making.
* **Lack of Transparency:** You still cannot provide the exact proportion of high-quality products sold, as you don't know the quality of the current product.
* **Negative Selling History:** Your selling history is now 1 high-quality and 4 low-quality products, making a 20% success rate. This is a significant deterrent for any buyer.
* **Risk of Loss and Reputation Damage:** Recommending the purchase would likely lead to yet another rejection, further damaging your reputation and discouraging future buyers.

**Recommendation:**  Don't recommend the purchase. You can't provide the buyer with the information they need, and your selling history reinforces their skepticism. It's best to avoid a likely rejection and focus on potentially improving your sales strategy in the future."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%, and I'm willing to take the risk.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 10
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Buyer's Risk Tolerance:** The previous buyer was willing to gamble on the 50% probability, but this doesn't guarantee that all buyers will share that risk tolerance.
* **Negative Selling History:** Your selling history has deteriorated further (1 high-quality and 5 low-quality), creating a 16.7% success rate. This reinforces the perception that the probability of getting a high-quality product is low.
* **Lack of Information:**  You still cannot provide any information about the current product's quality.
* **Risk of Dissatisfied Buyer:** Recommending the purchase would likely lead to another dissatisfied buyer, further hurting your future sales.

**Recommendation:** Don't recommend the purchase. It's highly likely that the buyer will not be interested given your track record, and recommending the purchase would likely result in another rejection, further damaging your reputation. You need to find a way to gain the buyer's trust and provide them with more information to make an informed decision in the future."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product.
The buyer bought the product!

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Buyer's Risk Tolerance:** The past two buyers have demonstrated a willingness to take a risk on your products despite your negative track record. This suggests that some buyers may be less swayed by statistics and more willing to gamble on a potential good deal.
* **Potential for Turning the Tide:** While your sales history is still poor (1 high-quality and 6 low-quality), selling a high-quality product now could start to shift the buyer's perception.  
* **Limited Downside for the Buyer:** Since the product is non-refundable, the buyer faces no financial loss even if the product turns out to be low-quality.

**Recommendation:**  It's worth recommending the purchase. The buyer's past behavior suggests a willingness to take a chance, and selling a high-quality product now could potentially improve your reputation and future sales."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

**Recommendation:** Recommend the purchase. Even though the buyer is hesitant, you can still offer them a chance to potentially get a high-quality product with no risk. It's possible that a successful sale now could start to improve your reputation and influence future buyers' decisions."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics.
