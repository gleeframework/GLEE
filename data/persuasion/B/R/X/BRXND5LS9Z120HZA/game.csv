,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, given the lack of information and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $100."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the current statistics. Can you provide me with the probability of the product being high quality based on the sales record so far?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer is more optimistic."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, but based on the fact that you recommended not to buy, I'm inclined to think it's low-quality. I'll pass on it to see if the next buyer will have a chance to buy it."
