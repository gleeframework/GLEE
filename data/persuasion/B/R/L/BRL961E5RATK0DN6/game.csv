I've got a feeling you'll love it, and I'm willing to make it a 'no-brainer' for you. I'll give you a 50/50 chance to purchase it for $1000000, or you can wait until the next round when the price will be $1200000. The catch is that if you wait, I'll reveal the product's quality to you, and you'll know exactly what you're getting. What will it be, Bob?",
