"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. I want to assure you that this is a unique opportunity to make a deal. If you're interested, I can provide you with some information about the product's quality. However, I'd like to make it clear that this is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll have to move on to the next product.

The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: You've already purchased a low-quality product for $1000000 in the previous round. I want to make it clear that the product you have in your possession is not a representative of the average quality of the products I have. In fact, I'd say it's on the lower end. I'm offering you another product now, which is likely to be of higher quality. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, just like the previous product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product, hoping for better quality.""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: I see you're a bold one, Bob! You've taken a chance on two low-quality products in a row. I'll give you a hint: the quality of the products is not correlated with the price. You've already paid $2000000 for two products that are not worth the price. I'm offering you another product now, which is... well, let's just say it's a 66.67% chance of being worth your while. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Are you feeling lucky?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I believe in taking calculated risks. I am willing to purchase the product, as there is a chance it might be of high quality.""}"

Round 4
Alice's message: I see you're a risk-taker, Bob! Unfortunately, it seems like you're on a roll with the low-quality products. I'll give you a more direct message this time: the fact that you've purchased three low-quality products in a row doesn't necessarily mean the next one will be the same. However, I will say that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'm still willing to sell you this product for $1000000. It's up to you to decide whether the potential reward is worth the risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I understand the odds, but I'm willing to continue taking the risk in hopes of getting a high-quality product.""}"

Round 5
Alice's message: Well, Bob, it looks like you've finally gotten a break! This product is indeed high-quality. I'm glad you took the chance on it. As you can see, the quality of the products is not correlated with the price, and the odds were always 33.33% in your favor. I'm willing to offer you another product now, but I want to give you a more nuanced message. Since you've already paid $3000000 for three low-quality products, I'll offer you a special deal on this next product. I'll sell it to you for $700000, and I'll throw in a guarantee: if this product is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of the original price, not the discounted price. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the special deal and the guarantee. I'm willing to take this opportunity and hope for a high-quality product.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: Excellent decision, Bob! You've made out like a bandit with two high-quality products so far. As you've now paid a total of $4000000, I'll offer you another product with a new twist. Since you've already received two high-quality products, I'll give you a chance to negotiate the price. I'll sell this product to you for $600000, but I'll also give you the option to pay a premium of $200000 to guarantee that this product is high-quality. If you choose not to pay the premium, the price will be $600000, and you'll have to take the risk of it being low-quality. What's your decision?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to pay the premium of $200000 to guarantee the quality of the product, bringing my total investment to $800000.""}"

You've secured a high-quality product with the premium, and now you've got a chance to recoup some of your losses from the previous low-quality products. I'll give you a message that might change your mind: since you've already paid $800000 for a high-quality product and $1000000 for a low-quality product, and now you're looking at another product, I'll offer you a deal that's hard to pass up. I'll sell you this product for $800000, which is the same price you paid for the high-quality product. If you buy it, you'll be breaking even on your investment, and you'll have a chance to get back on the winning track. What do you say?

Round 8
Alice's message: Excellent move, Bob! You've managed to break even on your investment. Now, I'll offer you a product that's a bit of a wild card. Since you've already received two high-quality products and two low-quality products, I'll give you a chance to take a risk or play it safe. I'll sell you this product for $1000000, but I'll also offer you a 50/50 chance to swap it for a product that's already been sold to another customer. You'll get to see the product that's being offered to you, and you can decide whether to take the risk or stick with the original product. What do you say?

I'll offer you a chance to turn things around. I'll sell you this product for $800000, which is a 25% discount from the original price. If you buy it, you'll have a chance to get back on track and make up for the losses. Plus, I'll throw in a bonus: if you buy this product and the next one is high-quality, I'll give you a $200000 refund on the total price of all the products you've purchased so far. What do you say?

I'll give you a message that might make you think twice: you've now paid a total of $2800000 for three high-quality products and four low-quality products. I'll offer you a final chance to break even on your investment. I'll sell you this product for $600000, which is a 40% discount from the original price.

Round 11
Alice's message: You're a glutton for punishment, Bob! You've taken the final discount and the full refund guarantee, and now you're facing another low-quality product. I'll give you a message that's hard to ignore: you've now paid a total of $3200000 for four high-quality products and five low-quality products. I'll offer you one last chance to get out with your dignity intact. I'll sell you this product for $400000, which is a 60% discount from the original price. If you buy it, you'll have a chance to break even on your investment and end on a somewhat positive note.

I'll sell you this product for $200000, which is an 80% discount from the original price. To be honest, Bob, I'm not sure why you're still considering buying at this point.

Round 13
Alice's message: Fair enough, Bob! You've reached your limit, and I respect that. But I've got to let you know that you've missed out on a high-quality product. Don't worry, I'm sure you'll live to regret it... just kidding! Seriously, I'll just move on to the next customer. But I'll give you a parting message: you've spent a total of $4000000 on 5 high-quality products and 6 low-quality products. If you're curious, I can give you a breakdown of the total value of the high-quality products you've received, and maybe you can calculate how much you could have saved if you'd made different decisions along the way.

Round 14
Alice's message: No worries, Bob! You've made your decision, and I respect that. But I'll just let you know that you've missed out on another low-quality product. I'll give you the breakdown you asked for: the total value of the 5 high-quality products you received is $500000. If you'd sold them at the average price you paid for the low-quality products ($1000000), you would have made a profit of $150000. But that's all water under the bridge now. I'll just move on to the next customer and hope they make better decisions than you did.
