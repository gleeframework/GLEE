low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing this only because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any information to go on. I'm essentially taking a wild guess."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk and possibly get a high-quality product at a low price."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'm curious, can you share the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on a sample size of only 2 buyers, and there are no high-quality products sold yet. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is there a pattern in the previous sales?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the previous two buyers who passed on the high-quality products. I think this might be a high-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations, but I'm not sure if the lack of high-quality products sold is just a coincidence or a trend. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as I've seen that all previous buyers have also passed on the product. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying, and only 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, I'm going to assume that the products you've recommended not to buy are low-quality. This would mean that 4 out of 4 low-quality products were sold, which is highly unlikely given the 50/50 chance of quality. This makes me skeptical about the quality of the product you're recommending not to buy. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous buyers passed on the products, making it more likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is available."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, please."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were not recommended by you and no high-quality products were sold, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I'll pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if I can get a better deal."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. If I were to buy it, I'd be taking on a high risk of getting a product worth $0 to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%, which would make it a bad deal for me."
