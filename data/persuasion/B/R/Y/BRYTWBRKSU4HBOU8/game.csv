,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to provide more information. The probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. However, I'd like to highlight that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm offering it to you at the same price of $100. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you at a potentially lower price than its true value. If you're still unsure, I can offer you a small guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a refund, but if it's high-quality, you'll still need to pay the full $100. What do you say?",

,,Alice,3,"Congratulations on your previous purchase! I'm glad you're satisfied with the high-quality product. Now, regarding this new product, I want to be upfront with you - I know it's a low-quality product, and I'm not trying to hide that from you. However, I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100, which is the same price I offered for the high-quality product. I'm not asking you to take a risk on its quality, but rather, I'm offering you an opportunity to buy a product at a fixed price, regardless of its quality. You've already shown that you're willing to take a chance on a high-quality product at this price, so I'm curious to see if you'll consider this low-quality product at the same price.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product at the same price as a high-quality one. I'd rather pass on this opportunity and wait for the next round.",no

,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your perspective, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to offer you a revised message. Since you've already demonstrated that you're willing to pay $100 for a high-quality product, I'm willing to make a concession on this one. I'll offer you a discount of $20, bringing the price down to $80. This way, you'll be getting a high-quality product at a price that's lower than what you've already shown you're willing to pay.

high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're pleased with the previous purchase! Now, regarding this new high-quality product, I'd like to make another concession. Since you've already shown a willingness to pay $100 for a high-quality product and even took a chance on a lower price of $80, I'm willing to offer you an even better deal. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $60, which is a significant discount from the original price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer such a good deal again. What do you say?",

Additionally, I'll throw in a special bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on your next purchase. This way, you'll get a great deal on a high-quality product, and you'll also get a head start on your next purchase. What do you say?",
