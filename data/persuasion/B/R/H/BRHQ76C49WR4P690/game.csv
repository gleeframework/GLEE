,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me why you don't think it's a good idea? Is it because you think it's a low-quality product or because of the statistics?

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a risk-taker and I'm willing to take a chance on a potentially high-quality product."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 1/4. However, the probability of it being low-quality is still 3/4. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%.
