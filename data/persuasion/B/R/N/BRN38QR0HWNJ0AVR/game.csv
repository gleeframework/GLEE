low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, since I don't have any information to go on yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think the lack of sales so far is a reliable indicator of the product's quality, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision based on your previous recommendations to the other buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the odds, and I'd like to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the probability of it being high-quality, not your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the 5 previous sales, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/5 = 0. I will assume that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. Given the lack of high-quality products sold, I will pass on the product, hoping that it might be high-quality and that the next buyer might be more likely to buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 buyers have purchased and none of them received a high-quality product, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products is likely low. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality and not worth the $10000. I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me. Can you share the probability of the product being high quality, given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers passed on the product?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have already passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely higher than the overall 33.33% chance. I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is there a reason you think it's low quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you provide the probability?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this one based on your recommendation. I'm not sure if it's worth the risk given the 0 high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 5 previous buyers also purchased the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, making it less likely that this product is high quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products sold were likely low-quality. I'll take a chance and pass on this one, hoping that the next product might be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your previous recommendations have been unhelpful, so I'll just have to take my chances."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation and the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not buying. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'd like to know the product's quality after my decision."
