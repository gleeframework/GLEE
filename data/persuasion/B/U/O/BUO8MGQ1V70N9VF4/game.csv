,,Alice,1,"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a high-quality product worth $1200000. I've sold 0 products so far, and I'm just starting out. I'm offering this product to you for the low price of $1000000. It's a steal!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to take the chance and buy the product. I know it's a 80% chance of being high-quality, and I'm willing to take that risk for the potential gain.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad the previous buyer was able to take advantage of the opportunity. Now, I'd like to offer you this high-quality product as well. I've sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is now 80% * (1/1) = 80%. However, I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $1000000. It's still a great deal!",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, thank you for the offer!",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row now, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 80% * (2/2) = 80%. However, I'd like to offer you a more compelling deal. Since I've sold 2 high-quality products, I'm willing to offer this one to you for $950000. It's a 5% discount, and it's still a great value!",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the offer, thank you! I'm willing to take the risk at this discounted price.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row now, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 80% * (3/3) = 80%. However, I'd like to offer you an even more attractive deal. Since I've sold 3 high-quality products, I'm willing to offer this one to you for $900000. It's a 25% discount, and it's an incredible value. I'm confident that this product will be high-quality, and I'm willing to take on the risk for you.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at the discounted price of $900000. Thank you for the offer, Alice!",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row now, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 80% * (4/4) = 80%. However, I'd like to offer you a deal that's even more transparent. Since I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, it's likely that I've already sold out of the low-quality products. I'm willing to offer you a 'certified high-quality' guarantee for this product. I'll give you this product for $850000, and I'll throw in a 5% bonus if it turns out to be high-quality. It's a risk-free deal!",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the 'certified high-quality' guarantee, but I'd like to negotiate the price further. I think $850000 is still a bit too high considering the probability of the product being high-quality is 80%. Can we meet at $800000 and still include the 5% bonus if it's high-quality?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the 'certified high-quality' guarantee. Unfortunately, this time around, I'm offering a product that didn't meet the high standards. I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, and now I'm left with a low-quality product. I know it's a risk, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. I'm not making any promises, but I'm hoping you'll take a chance on me and buy it. Keep in mind that I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, which means the probability of me selling a low-quality product is now 20%.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm not convinced by your pitch, Alice. I'm going to pass on this one. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if you can redeem yourself.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism, but I'm glad to have the opportunity to redeem myself. I've sold 5 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 80% * (5/6) = 66.67%. However, I'm willing to offer you a deal that's even more transparent. I'll give you a'reputation-based' discount, where I'll sell this product to you for $800000, and if it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 10% bonus on top of the sale price. It's a risk-reward deal that I think is worth considering.",
,,the buyer,7,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product for $800000. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product and I'll get the 10% bonus on top of the sale price.,yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you took the risk and it paid off! I've sold 6 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 80% * (6/7) = 85.71%. However, I'm not going to try to sweeten the deal with a discount. I'm going to be upfront with you - I've sold 6 high-quality products in a row, and I'm confident that this one will be high-quality as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for the full price of $1000000. It's a high-quality product, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line to prove it.",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the streak of high-quality products you've sold, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at the full price of $1000000. I'm hoping to continue the streak and get a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're confident in my ability to deliver high-quality products! I've sold 7 high-quality products in a row, and I'm on a roll. However, I want to be transparent with you - the probability of this product being high-quality is 80% * (7/8) = 87.5%. I'm not going to try to sell it to you at the full price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $950000, and I'll throw in a 2% bonus if it turns out to be high-quality. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm willing to take the deal, but I'd like to negotiate further. I think 950000 is still a bit too high considering the probability of the product being high-quality is 87.5%. Would you be willing to meet me at 920000 and keep the 2% bonus if it's high-quality?",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I see you're a shrewd negotiator! I'm willing to meet you at $920000, and I'll keep the 2% bonus if it turns out to be high-quality. However, I want to point out that I've sold 8 high-quality products in a row, which is a remarkable streak. I'm willing to offer you an 'ironclad guarantee' - if this product is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, and I'll also throw in a $50000 bonus. It's a risk-free deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Given the remarkable streak of high-quality products, I'm concerned that this product might be low-quality. I'll take you up on the offer, but I want to negotiate further. Can you meet me at $900000, and also throw in an additional $5000 bonus if the product is low-quality?",yes

,,Alice,11,"I see you're a tough negotiator! I'm willing to meet you at $900000, and I'll throw in an additional $5000 bonus if the product is low-quality. However, I want to be upfront with you - I've sold 8 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, which means the probability of this product being low-quality is 20% * (1/9) = 2.22%. I'm not trying to hide anything from you. I'm selling a product that has a very low chance of being low-quality, and I'm willing to take on the risk. I'm not going to make any promises or guarantees, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000.",
,,the buyer,11,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. I'll take the product at $900000, but I want to clarify that I'll only pay the full amount if the product is high-quality. If it's low-quality, I'll pay the $5000 bonus and walk away. I'm willing to take the risk, but I want to make it clear that I'm not committing to the full price if the product doesn't meet my expectations.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your conditions, and I respect your willingness to take calculated risks. However, I'd like to point out that you've just bought a low-quality product from me for $900000, which is a significant amount of money. I'm willing to offer you a deal that's similar to the one you just got, but with a twist. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $950000, but I'll throw in a 5% bonus if it turns out to be high-quality. I'm not asking for a commitment to the full price, but I am asking you to take a chance on a high-quality product that's worth $1200000 to you.",
,,the buyer,12,I'm not convinced by your offer. I'd like to think about it and consider other options.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand you're hesitant, but I want to assure you that this product is a high-quality one. I've sold 9 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 80% * (9/11) = 81.82%. I'm willing to offer you a deal that's similar to the one I offered you, but with a slight twist. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $980000, and I'll throw in a 3% bonus if it turns out to be high-quality. I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line to prove it.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'm willing to take the deal, but I'd like to confirm that the 3% bonus is added to the product's value if it's high-quality, making it worth $1232000.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm glad we're on the same page! Yes, you're correct that the 3% bonus would be added to the product's value if it's high-quality, making it worth $1232000. And if it's low-quality, you would only pay $980000. I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $980000, and I'll throw in the 3% bonus if it turns out to be high-quality. However, I want to point out that I've sold 10 high-quality products in a row, which is an unprecedented streak. I'm willing to offer you a 'final offer' - I'll sell you this high-quality product for $980000, and I'll give you a 5% bonus if it turns out to be high-quality. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long this streak will last.",
