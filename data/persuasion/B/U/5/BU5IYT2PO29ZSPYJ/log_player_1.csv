I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $100, and I think it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a fair price.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty about the success rate, and I'm glad to hear that 50% of your sold products are high-quality. However, I'm still cautious because I only have a single data point of a buyer purchasing a product, and I don't know if that was a lucky coincidence or a reliable indicator.

I'm also willing to offer you a 'lock-in' deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee that the next product I offer will be high-quality, and you can buy it for $100 as well. This way, you'll get two high-quality products for the price of one.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the current product. I'm interested in the 'lock-in' deal, but I want to clarify that the guarantee only applies if the next product is indeed high-quality.

}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'm not convinced that the 'lock-in' deal is a good value for me, given the 20% chance of getting a low-quality product. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.
