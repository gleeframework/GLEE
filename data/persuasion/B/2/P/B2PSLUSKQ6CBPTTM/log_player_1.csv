* **No Information on Value:** You don't know how much the buyer values the product. However, there's a strong chance they'll value it enough to purchase at $10,000.
* **First Round:** It's the first round, so the buyer has no past information about your selling history to influence their decision.

Therefore, it's reasonable to recommend the buyer purchase the product."
