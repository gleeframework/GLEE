,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to pass on this one. I know it's your first sale, and I'm not convinced by the statistics. I'd like to wait and see more data before making a decision.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I assure you that our statistics are accurate.

,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to provide more information. We've had a total of 4 potential buyers so far, and we've sold 2 products. Of those 2 sold, 2 were high-quality. That means the proportion of high-quality products sold is 100%! I want to emphasize that our products are consistently high-quality, and I'm confident that this one will be no exception. As I mentioned earlier, we've only had 2 products in stock, and both of them have been high-quality.

Are you ready to take advantage of this incredible opportunity and buy this high-quality product for $100?",

Now, let's talk about the product you're about to buy. This one is a bit of a different story. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this product is a low-quality item. It's not worth the full $100, and I'm only selling it to you because I need to clear out some inventory. I'm willing to let it go for $50, and that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll throw in a free return policy, so you can return it if you're not satisfied. What do you say?",
