**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products (5/5). 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality, is recommending the purchase. This is strong evidence the product is high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if the product is low quality, the worst outcome is losing $10,000.  The potential gain of $20,000 (from a high-quality product) outweighs this risk, especially given the strong indicators."
