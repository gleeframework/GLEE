**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have data from one previous buyer, making it difficult to assess the reliability of Alice's recommendations.
* **Positive Signal:**  The previous buyer bought the product, and it was high quality. This is a strong positive signal.
* **Potential Value:**  Even with a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($20,000) is significant, especially with the positive signal from the previous sale. 

**Strategy:**  Given the potential reward, the positive signal, and the lack of data to suggest Alice is dishonest, it makes sense to take a calculated risk and buy the product."
