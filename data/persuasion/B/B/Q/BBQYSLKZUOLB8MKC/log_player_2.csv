**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, knowing the product's true value, recommends buying it. This is strong evidence that the product is high quality.
* **Statistics:**  Even though only one product was sold before, it was a high-quality one, indicating that Alice's recommendations are likely accurate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $200 (if it's high quality) outweighs the risk of losing $100 (if it's low quality). 

Therefore, based on the available information, it's more advantageous to buy the product."
