Alice's message: I'm glad you're cautious, but I'm afraid I'm a street vendor, not a showroom. I don't have the luxury of letting you inspect the product. However, I can tell you that you're the third buyer in a row to receive a high-quality product. The probability of me selling three high-quality products in a row is extremely low.
