,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, I don't have any information to go on yet, so I'll treat it as a fair gamble"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the probability of it being high-quality, not your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that Alice is not recommending the product, and considering the low success rate of high-quality products being sold, I'm inclined to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that 3 previous buyers passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. I'm not sure what to make of your recommendation, but I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but given her lack of confidence, I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and given your previous recommendations, I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if I can get more information from the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend me to buy the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. If the probability is high enough, I'd like to buy it."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 6 buyers before me and no high-quality products sold, I'm worried that the probability of this product being high-quality is still relatively low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's high quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 7 buyers have been presented with high-quality products and none of them have bought, I infer that the probability of a high-quality product being presented to me is lower than 33.33%. This is because the probability of 7 consecutive low-quality products being presented to 7 buyers is very low. I'm going to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, but based on the statistics, it seems like the probability of it being high-quality is low. I'd like to know the number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems that all products sold so far have been low-quality, which is consistent with the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality. Alice's recommendation is not very convincing to me, and I'd rather not risk buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 out of 7 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products you're offering. I'd like to wait for a more representative sample size or a different recommendation."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'm going to pass on it."
