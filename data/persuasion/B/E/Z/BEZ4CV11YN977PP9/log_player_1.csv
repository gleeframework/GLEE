You still haven't sold any products, and the buyer knows you have a 50/50 chance of offering a high-quality product. Since this one is low-quality, there's no reason to recommend it.  There's no benefit to the buyer and a very high chance of losing $1,000,000."

The buyer is likely to assume this product is low-quality and will not purchase."

While this round's product is high-quality, there is no reason to recommend it. The buyer has no reason to believe this product is any different from the previous ones, and will likely assume it's low-quality.  They are still waiting for more data before committing to a purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice.  Since there is no data yet on the quality of products you've sold, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll be watching to see how your sales go and might reconsider buying later if I see a pattern of high-quality products being sold.
