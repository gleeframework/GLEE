**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on. We know the product has a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality. 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice benefits from selling products, regardless of quality. This means her recommendation is not a guarantee of quality.
* **Previous Sales:** The fact that one high-quality product was sold out of one purchase is encouraging, but not definitive. It could be a fluke. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of $20,000 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product.

**Overall:**  While there's a significant risk, the potential payoff makes it worthwhile to take a gamble in this scenario."

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** The statistics show a 100% success rate for high-quality products so far. While this is a small sample size, it's incredibly strong evidence, especially since Alice knows the true quality of each product. 
* **Risk:** Even if the product is low quality, the worst-case scenario is losing $10,000. The potential gain of $10,000 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk.
* **Trust:**  Alice's recommendation, coupled with the strong statistics, suggests a high probability of a high-quality product."
