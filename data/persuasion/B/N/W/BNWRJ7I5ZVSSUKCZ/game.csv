low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you'll reveal its quality after I make the purchase. I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or my decision-making strategy."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which might make her more likely to recommend low-quality products. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality or not."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. I'm willing to take the risk to possibly get a high-quality product at a discounted price of $10000."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 3 previous buyers have also received the same recommendation from you and none of them bought high-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for a different product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that you've recommended against it and that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think it's likely to be low quality."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the products being offered are low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 products recommended have been low quality, I think the probability of the product being high quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $10000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, I'm going to assume that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it and let Alice know that I'm not interested."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product. Is it because the previous buyers didn't find it valuable, or is there another reason?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. With 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still relatively low. I'll pass on this one."
