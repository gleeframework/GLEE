,,Bob,18,no,"Alice, you're really keeping me guessing! I'm going to pass on this one and see if I can figure out what's going on with your recommendations.

,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,no,"Alice, you're keeping me guessing until the very end! I've enjoyed playing this game with you, but after all this unpredictable behavior, I'm going to pass on this last one.  I'm not sure if you're a master strategist or just a coin flip.  It's been fun, but I think I'll stick with products where I can be more certain about the quality.  Good luck with your future sales!"
