**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:** With only one previous sale and a high-quality product sold, the probability of this product being high quality is significantly higher than 50%. 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has a strong incentive to recommend high-quality products since she knows how much each product is worth to buyers. Her recommendation provides valuable information.
* **Potential Gain:** The potential gain of $300 (worth $400 - price $100) significantly outweighs the potential loss of $100 if it turns out to be low quality."
