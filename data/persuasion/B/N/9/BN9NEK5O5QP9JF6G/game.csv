low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I'm willing to take the risk since it's the first product and I have no prior information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share the number of total products sold and the number of high-quality products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to ask, what's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? And how many products have been sold in total?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, it suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not taking your recommendation into account. I'm making my decision based on my own probability assessment."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that since 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall 50% chance. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there a particular pattern or information that led you to advise me not to buy this product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm hoping that the product is a high-quality one and that the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far is just a coincidence."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the previous sales data or something else?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample and there may be a higher proportion of low-quality products among the ones she's recommended so far."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that since all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, it's possible that the previous buyers were just unlucky, but I'd rather be cautious and pass on this product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 buyers have already been offered products and none of them were high quality, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold in the previous 7 attempts, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the previous sales record or do you have any other information?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, but I know that so far 7 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product."
