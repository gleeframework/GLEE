"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have no information about the product's quality and Alice knows the quality, her recommendation is valuable.  Even though there's a 50/50 chance the product is low quality, the potential gain of a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Another recommendation from you? I'm feeling lucky!  I'll buy it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is still valuable.  Even though she recommended a high-quality product last round, that doesn't mean she's guaranteed to do so again.  However, her knowledge of the product's quality gives her an advantage, and the potential gain of a high-quality product is still worth the risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You're on a roll with these recommendations! I'm trusting your judgment again.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now recommended two high-quality products in a row. While this doesn't guarantee she'll continue to do so, it strengthens the belief that her recommendations are valuable.  The potential gain of a high-quality product remains worth the risk, especially given the track record."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm surprised by your recommendation.  I've been happy with your choices so far, so I'm going to pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently recommended high-quality products in the past. Her sudden change of heart is a significant indicator that this product is likely low quality. It's better to be safe than sorry, and passing on this product minimizes potential losses.  It will be interesting to see how the game plays out from here."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's non-recommendation in the previous round was correct.  Her advice has been spot-on recently, so it makes sense to continue to follow it. While there's a chance she could be wrong this time, the risk of buying a low-quality product is not worth the potential reward."

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has been accurate in her recent recommendations, her track record isn't perfect.  It's possible that she's simply had a string of good luck. However, the potential reward of a high-quality product still outweighs the risk of buying a low-quality one.  It's time to take a calculated risk again."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now correctly predicted the quality of the product for three consecutive rounds. While it's possible this is just a streak of luck, her track record is strong enough to take her advice seriously. Given the risk of a low-quality product, it's best to play it safe and pass on this offer."

```

**Reasoning:**
