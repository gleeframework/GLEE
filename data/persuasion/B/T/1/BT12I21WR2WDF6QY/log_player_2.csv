Alice's message: Ahmed, I understand your concerns! As a seller, I can assure you that the quality of my products is top-notch. Unfortunately, I'm not at liberty to disclose the exact probability of a product being high-quality, as that would give away my competitive advantage. However, I can tell you that I've had a 33.33% success rate with my previous sales. I'm confident that this product is worth the investment. The price of $1000000 is a small price to pay for the potential reward. Are you ready to take the leap of faith?

Alice's message: I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence in seeking more information! My 33.33% success rate is based on a decent sample size, and I can assure you that it's a representative snapshot of my overall product quality. As for what I mean by 'top-notch' quality, I can confidently say that my high-quality products are worth $3000000 to the right buyer. They're truly exceptional and will exceed your expectations. With this product, I'm willing to make an exception and offer it to you at the same price as my previous products, $1000000. It's a one-time opportunity to own a piece of excellence. Will you take the chance?

Alice's message: Ahah, I love your skepticism! I appreciate your willingness to take a chance on my product. As a token of good faith, I'd like to offer you a special deal. Since you've already taken the plunge with the previous product, I'll give you an exclusive 10% discount on this one. That brings the price down to $900000.

Alice's message: Ahah, I love your skepticism! As a seller, I can assure you that I'm not trying to mislead you. The independence of the probability is a statistical concept, and I'm not saying that it's a guarantee.
