* **High-quality product:** The product in this round is confirmed to be high-quality.
* **Buyer's perspective:** The buyer knows there's an 80% chance of a high-quality product, which is worth $1,250,000.  
* **Profit:**  The buyer would make a profit of $250,000 ($1,250,000 - $1,000,000) if they buy the high-quality product. 
* **Risk:** There's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, which would result in a loss of $1,000,000. 
* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product is (0.8 * $250,000) + (0.2 * -$1,000,000) = $200,000 - $200,000 = $0.
