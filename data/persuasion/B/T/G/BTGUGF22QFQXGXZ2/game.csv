,,Alice,4,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the previous product! As promised, I'm standing by my guarantee. Now, regarding this new product, I want to be upfront with you. Given the previous product was a high-quality item, I'm concerned that you might be expecting a similar outcome. However, I want to assure you that this product is not as valuable as the last one. In fact, I'm willing to be even more transparent: this product is a low-quality item, and it's only worth $0 to you. I'm offering it to you for $10000, but I'm willing to throw in a unique opportunity: I'll give you a chance to negotiate the price of the next product based on your experience with this one.

,,Alice,6,"I understand your strategy, and I respect your patience. Given your experience with the previous low-quality products, I'm willing to make a bold offer. This product is a high-quality item, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth at least $30000 to you. I'll offer it to you for $10000, but I'll also throw in a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a second product of your choice (either high-quality or low-quality) for free. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on the risk of giving you a free product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I want to make it clear that I expect the product to be high-quality and worth at least $30000 to me. If it's not, I'll be very disappointed and may reconsider our future transactions.",yes
