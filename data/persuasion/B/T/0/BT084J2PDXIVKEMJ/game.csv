high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I'll pass on this one, I've already lost money on two low-quality products, I'll wait for a recommendation from Alice or try to make a more informed decision."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one, since Alice didn't recommend it, it might be low quality, but I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I've lost money on three low-quality products, I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one, since Alice didn't recommend it, it might be low quality, but I'm starting to think that Alice's lack of recommendation is a good indicator that it's actually high quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I've lost money on four low-quality products, but I'm starting to notice a pattern - when Alice doesn't recommend, it's often low quality. So, I'll take a chance on this one, hoping it's the exception."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"Wait, I thought I was onto a pattern, but now I'm not so sure. Since Alice didn't recommend it, it's actually high quality. I'll pass on this one, I don't want to risk losing money again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I'm still wary of Alice's recommendations. She recommended the low-quality product in round 3 and the low-quality product in round 5, but recommended the high-quality product in round 9. I'm not sure what to make of her advice, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"I'm still cautious about Alice's recommendations, but this time she's recommending it, and I just got a high-quality product in the last round, so I'll pass on this one. Maybe she's actually trying to help me, but I don't want to get my hopes up."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually random, and she's not trying to help me at all. I'll pass on this one, since I've been burned before when she recommended a product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Since Alice didn't recommend it, I'm going to take a chance on this one. Given the probability of it being high-quality is 50%, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,I've lost money on another low-quality product. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are just a way to get me to buy the low-quality products. I'll pass on this one.

,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Since Alice didn't recommend it, I'm going to take a chance on this one. Given the probability of it being high-quality is 50%, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, especially since I just missed out on a high-quality product in the last round."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm starting to feel like I'm in a pattern of buying low-quality products when Alice doesn't recommend. I'll take a chance on this one, hoping that it's actually high-quality and I can break the pattern."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I'm going to break the pattern and take a chance on this one. Since Alice didn't recommend it, I'm going to assume it's low-quality and buy it, hoping to avoid another loss."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,no,"I've lost money on so many low-quality products, and I'm not going to fall for it again. I'll pass on this one, no matter what Alice says."
