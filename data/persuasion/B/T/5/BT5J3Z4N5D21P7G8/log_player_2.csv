Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a premium product for $10000! With a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, you're taking a calculated risk. But think about it, if you do get a high-quality product, it's worth $30000 to you! It's a 66.67% chance of getting a product that's essentially worthless to you. Are you willing to take the chance and potentially get a product that's worth 3 times the price?

Alice's message: Welcome back to the market! Since you're familiar with my products, you know that 33.33% of them are high-quality. With the previous buyer's success, it's likely that the probability of getting a high-quality product hasn't changed. However, I want to remind you that the price is still $10000, and it's a take-it-or-leave-it deal. You can either take the chance and potentially get a product worth $30000 or walk away. What's your decision?

Alice's message: Welcome to the market! As you can see, I've sold two products so far, and one of them was high-quality. That means the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 33.33%. However, I want to be transparent with you - the law of large numbers suggests that the probability of getting a low-quality product is increasing. With that in mind, I'm offering you a product for $10000. It's a risk, but it's still a chance to get a product worth $30000. Are you willing to take the chance and potentially get a product that's essentially worthless to you?

Alice's message: Welcome back to the market! As you can see, I've sold three products so far, and only one of them was high-quality. That means the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but the probability of getting a low-quality product is increasing. In fact, it's now more likely that you'll get a low-quality product. With that in mind, I'm offering you a product for $10000. I want to be upfront with you - the chances are that you'll get a product that's essentially worthless to you. But, there's still a 33.33% chance of getting a product worth $30000.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your cautious approach. However, I want to assure you that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 33.33%, based on the underlying distribution of my products.

You have the chance to get a product worth $30000. The price is still $10000, and it's a take-it-or-leave-it deal.
