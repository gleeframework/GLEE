Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know the product is high-quality. Since the buyer knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, there's a good chance they'll be willing to take the risk for a potential good deal. There's no information about the buyer's specific valuation of high-quality products, so recommending the purchase is the best strategy in this initial round."
