This is a significant increase from the initial 50% probability. However, keep in mind that this is still a probabilistic estimate, and the actual quality of the product is uncertain.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the streak of low-quality products. To be transparent, I can tell you that the streak is likely due to the fact that I've been selling low-quality products to buyers who are cautious and hesitant to take risks. This has led to a self-reinforcing cycle, where I'm more likely to sell low-quality products to buyers who are already skeptical. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the next product will be low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000.

I can tell you that they were a mix of first-time and repeat buyers, and their strategies varied. However, I can share some general trends. The first-time buyers who purchased low-quality products were more likely to be optimistic and willing to take risks, while the repeat buyers who purchased low-quality products were more likely to be cautious and skeptical. In contrast, the buyers who purchased high-quality products were often repeat buyers who had a more nuanced understanding of my sales strategy.
