Alice's message: I'm offering you a product for $10000. I'm willing to sell it to you at this price, but I want to assure you that I'm not desperate. I've had other buyers interested in this product, and I'm confident that it's a good deal. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

I'm not trying to lowball you, but I want to give you a better sense of the value I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to buy it at $5000, I'll sell it to you at that price.

Round 5

I'm not saying that this product is high-quality, but I'm willing to put my own reputation on the line to give you more confidence in the deal.
