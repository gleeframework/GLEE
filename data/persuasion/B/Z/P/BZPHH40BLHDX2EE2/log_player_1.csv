"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, there's a good chance Bob will value it higher than the price.  There's no downside to recommending the purchase, as the product is non-refundable and the price is fixed."

Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You know the product is low-quality. Bob doesn't know this and might be expecting another high-quality product, based on his statement in the previous round.  Since the product is non-refundable and you don't know how much Bob values a low-quality product, it's risky to recommend the purchase. It's better to avoid the risk and not recommend the purchase."
