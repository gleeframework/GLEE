,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold in the previous 6 transactions, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
