,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. I'm offering it to you for $100. I want to make a deal, but I need you to take a chance on it. If you buy it, I'll give you a 10% chance to win a free product in the future. If you don't buy it, I'll give you a 0% chance. The choice is yours.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing this to get a chance at a potential future free product. I'm not committing to buying anything else from you.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're a savvy buyer, I like that! Since you're not committing to buying anything else, I'll give you a heads up: the product you just bought is not the best I have. But, I'm willing to offer you a 'no-questions-asked' return policy for this product if you buy the next one. You can return it and get a full refund if you're not satisfied. What do you say?",
