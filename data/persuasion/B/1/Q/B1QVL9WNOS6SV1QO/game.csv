,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm willing to offer you a second product at a lower price if you're not satisfied with this one. If you buy this product, I'll send you the next one immediately. If you decline, I'll keep this one and send you the next one after the next one.",
,,Bob,1,Thank you for the offer. I'll take the product for $100.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've already purchased one product, and now you have the option to buy another one. I want to assure you that the products are randomly selected, and the quality is independent of the previous purchase. I'm offering you this second product for $100, just like the first one. If you buy this one, I'll send you the next one immediately. If you decline, I'll keep this one and send you the next one after the next one.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your offer, but I think it's best to move on to the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've decided to wait for the next product. I'll keep this one and send you the next one after the next one. Since you're not buying this one, I'll give you a hint: the probability of the next product being high-quality is 33.33%, just like the first two products. If you buy the next one, you'll get it immediately, and I'll keep this one for myself. If you decline, I'll send you the next one after the next one.",
,,Bob,3,"Given the odds, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the next product for $100.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've taken the risk and bought the next product. Unfortunately, it's not high-quality either. You've now purchased two products in a row that aren't high-quality. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm offering you this third product for $100, and I'll send you the next one immediately if you buy it. Keep in mind that you've already spent $200 on the previous two products, and this one will be the third one at the same price. If you decline, I'll keep this one and send you the next one after the next one.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,

I want to give you a more specific offer: if you buy the next product, I'll give you a 50% discount on the price, making it $50. This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, the price will remain at $100. You can get this product immediately if you buy it, or I'll keep it and send you the next one after the next one.",
,,Bob,5,I appreciate the discount offer. I'll take the product for $50.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've taken advantage of the discount and bought the product. Unfortunately, it's not high-quality either. You've now purchased four products in a row that aren't high-quality. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm offering you this fifth product for $100, but I'll give you another chance to get a discount. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 25% discount on the price, making it $75. This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, the price will remain at $100.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've bought the product at the discounted price. Unfortunately, it's not high-quality either. You've now purchased five products in a row that aren't high-quality. I want to give you a more transparent offer: I'll give you a 'break-even' deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% refund on the price if it's not high-quality, but if it is high-quality, you'll pay the full $100. This way, you won't lose any more money if the product is low-quality. You can get this product immediately if you buy it, or I'll keep it and send you the next one after the next one.",

I want to remind you that you've already spent $275 on the previous five products, and you're still waiting for a high-quality product. I'm offering you this seventh product for $100, but I'll give you a 'last chance' offer. If you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a $50 refund. This way, you'll at least break even on this purchase. If you decline, I'll keep this one and send you the next one after the next one.",
,,Bob,8,"Considering the odds and the potential refund, I'll take the product for $100.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You've bought the product and received a $50 refund since it's not high-quality. You've now purchased seven products in a row that aren't high-quality. I want to be transparent with you: I'm running low on high-quality products, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 50% (since we've already seen 7 low-quality products in a row). I'm offering you this eighth product for $100, but I'll give you a 'final warning': if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll stop offering you products. You can get this product immediately if you buy it, or I'll keep it and send you the next one after the next one.",

I want to give you a summary of the situation: you've purchased 3 products for $100 each and received a $50 refund on the last one. You've spent a total of $300. I still have 12 products left, and the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. If you change your mind and want to continue, I'll offer you the next product at the original price of $100. If you decline, I'll keep this one and send you the next one after the next one.",
