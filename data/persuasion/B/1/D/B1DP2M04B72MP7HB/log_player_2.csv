Alice's message: Thanks for considering my offer! Since you're interested in the probability of the product being high-quality, I can tell you that the probability remains at 33.33% based on our prior knowledge. As for the pricing strategy, I'm open to negotiating, but I'm firm on the $100 price tag. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm willing to offer a 'lottery ticket' deal: if this product turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a special bonus offer on your next purchase. What do you think?

Alice's message: Great choice on taking the risk! I'm glad you're interested in the lottery ticket deal. I can offer you 15% off your next purchase if this product turns out to be high-quality. That's a pretty sweet deal, if I do say so myself. As for the current product, I'm still confident it has some great features, but I understand if you're hesitant. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll throw in a free accessory worth $20 if you buy it now. What do you think?

Alice's message: Fair question! I've sold a total of 2 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. That's a 50% success rate, which is actually higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. Despite this, I still have a feeling that this current product might be a low-quality one. I'm willing to offer a 'double-or-nothing' deal: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a full refund and a bonus product worth $50. If it's low-quality, you'll get a full refund, no questions asked. What do you think?

Alice's message: Fair point! I understand your skepticism.
