In fact, based on my sales record, I'd say there's only a 33.33% chance it's high-quality. But, I want to emphasize that this is just a rough estimate, and I'm not sure what the actual quality is. If you're willing to take a risk, I can offer you this product for $100. But if you're looking for a safer bet, I might have some other options available later on.",

If you're willing to take a chance, you might get lucky and get a high-quality product.
