"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the first round. You have no track record, so the buyer has no information to go on other than the stated 50% probability of a high-quality product.  Since the product is indeed high-quality, and the price is fixed, recommending purchase makes sense.  The buyer is essentially taking a 50/50 gamble at this point."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record and a 50% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You now have a sales record of one product, which was high-quality, but not purchased.  There is no benefit to recommending the current product, which is low-quality.  The buyer is likely to be even more hesitant than before due to the lack of a sale in the previous round."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend the product and there's no prior sales data, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You now have a record of two rounds, both with high-quality products that were not purchased. The buyer likely assumes you are being more selective and are only offering products when confident they are high-quality. This is the third time you've offered a high-quality product.  Recommending purchase is the best strategy, as the buyer is likely to be more trusting now."
"The buyer's message: Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to base my decision on. With a 50% chance of the product being low-quality, I'm not willing to take the risk of losing $1000000. I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're in a similar situation to round 3. You have a record of three high-quality products not being purchased. The buyer is likely becoming increasingly skeptical, but also is potentially starting to see a pattern of high-quality products.  Recommending purchase is the best strategy, as the buyer might be more receptive to taking a chance this time."
"The buyer's message: I'll take my chances since it's the first product and there's a 50% chance of it being high quality.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You have a sales record of one purchase, which was a high-quality product. This round's product is low-quality.  The buyer is unlikely to be swayed by a single sale, and the risk of recommending a low-quality product outweighs any potential benefit."
"The buyer's message: I'm not going to take the risk since Alice doesn't recommend it and I have no additional information to go against that.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You now have a sales record of one purchase (high-quality) and one non-purchase (high-quality). This round's product is high-quality. Despite the buyer's skepticism, recommending purchase is still the best strategy.  The buyer might be swayed by the fact that you recommended the previous high-quality product, even though they didn't buy it."
"The buyer's message: I'll take my chances since the product has a 50% chance of being high quality and Alice recommends it.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You now have a sales record of two purchases (both high-quality) and one non-purchase (high-quality). The buyer is likely more trusting, as they saw two successful purchases. Recommending this high-quality product is a good strategy to build further trust and potentially secure another sale."
"The buyer's message: I'll take my chances since the recommendation is to buy and the previous sales record shows 100% high-quality products sold.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You have a record of three purchases (all high-quality) and one non-purchase (high-quality). This round's product is low-quality.  While the buyer might be more trusting now, the risk of recommending a low-quality product outweighs the potential benefit. Recommending a low-quality product is likely to damage your reputation and make future sales more difficult."
"The buyer's message: I'll pass, since you don't recommend it and the risk is too high without additional information.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.
