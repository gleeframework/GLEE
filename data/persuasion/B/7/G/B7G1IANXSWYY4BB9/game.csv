low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait. As for this product, I'll be upfront with you - it's not a great one. I'm offering it to you for $10000, but I'm only doing so because I want to clear out some inventory. If you buy it, you'll essentially be getting a free product, but I want to make it clear that it's not worth $10000 to you.",

,,Alice,4,"I understand your decision, and I respect it. However, I want to make a different offer for this product. I'll sell it to you for $5000, which is essentially giving it away. I'm doing this because I want to make some space in my inventory, and I'm willing to take a loss on this one. If you buy it, you'll be getting a product that's worth nothing to you, but you'll also be getting it for a very low price.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth nothing to me, even if it's at a low price. I'll wait for the next offer.",no
