,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know how you're calculating your 100% success rate. With only 6 total products sold, I'm assuming that's a typo and you meant to say 100% of the products sold have been high-quality, not 100% of the products sold have been successful purchases.
