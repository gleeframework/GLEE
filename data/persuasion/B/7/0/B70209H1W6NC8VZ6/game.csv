,,Alice,4,"Congratulations, you're considering our product at a critical moment! We've sold 3 products so far, with 1 out of 2 being low-quality, but this one has the potential to be a game-changer. Given the 50% chance of it being high-quality, we're offering this product to you at the same price of $1000000. We believe the potential profit of $4000000 is worth the risk. Are you willing to take the chance and potentially earn a huge profit, or would you like to walk away?",

Based on the statistics provided, 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which raises concerns about the reliability of your recommendations.
