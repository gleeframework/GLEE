high-quality,400.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm buying it blindly without any information, and I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'm not buying this product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product? Was it a high-quality product or a low-quality product that they bought?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold before I make a decision. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, the probability seems too low to justify a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the first product sold was high-quality, but I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as Alice's recommendation is not reliable since she doesn't know the true value of the product to me. I'd like to wait for more information and possibly a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyer bought a high-quality product, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is higher than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and hope to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering your previous recommendations have been accurate so far, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to know the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea based on your previous recommendations. Can you explain why you don't recommend it? Is it because of the low-quality product sold to the first buyer?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the recommendation might be biased by the fact that Alice doesn't know the value I place on the product, and the fact that the previous 3 buyers might have made different decisions based on their own valuations. I'd like to wait for more information or try to gather more data before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
