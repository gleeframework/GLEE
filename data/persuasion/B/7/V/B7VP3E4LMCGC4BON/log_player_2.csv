Alice's message: Welcome to the fourth product! I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, and I've sold 1 low-quality product so far. You know that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but my success rate is now 75%. This is a significant improvement, and it's starting to look like I have a bias towards selling high-quality products. However, it's still possible that I'm just getting lucky. I want to offer you a different perspective: if I was truly selling random products, we would expect to see around 1.5 high-quality products out of 4 by chance. Since I've sold 3 high-quality products, that's more than 2 standard deviations away from the expected value. This suggests that there might be some underlying structure to my sales, and it could be worth taking a closer look. I'm selling this product to you for $100. What do you think?
