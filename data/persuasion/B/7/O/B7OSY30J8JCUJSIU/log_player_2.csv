**Explanation:**

* **The data is limited:** We only have one previous buyer who purchased a high-quality product. This is not enough data to make a strong statistical inference about the quality of future products.
* **Alice's recommendation is a signal:** While Alice doesn't know the individual product's quality, she likely has some insights based on her overall inventory. Her recommendation to buy adds a bit of weight to the decision.
* **The potential reward outweighs the risk:**  Even though there's a higher chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $1,200,000 for a high-quality product is significant. 

**This decision is a calculated risk based on the limited information available.**"
