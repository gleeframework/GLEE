high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but I'm aware that 1 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the product, and only 1 out of those 3 products was high quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4 purchases, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/4 or 0.25. However, the true probability of a product being high-quality is 0.5. I'd like to pass on this product and wait for the next one to get a better sense of the distribution of product qualities."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping that since you don't know my valuation, you're not considering the fact that I value high-quality products at $1250000, and therefore you might be more likely to recommend a low-quality product if you thought I would buy it. Am I right in assuming this is the case?"
