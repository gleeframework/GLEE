Alice's message: You have a 50% chance of buying a high-quality product, but I'm offering it to you for $10000. If you buy it, you'll get a high-quality product, but if you don't, I'll sell it to someone else who might get a high-quality product. You can't know for sure what you're getting, but you know the odds. What's your decision?

This means that the product I'm offering you now is the first low-quality product I've had in a row. Given the odds, this is a 50% chance. However, since the first buyer just got a high-quality product, it's possible that the next product I have is also high-quality. You're taking a risk by buying now, but you could get a great deal.

Alice's message: You're the third buyer, and you know that the first two products were both high-quality. This means that I've had two high-quality products in a row, which is a 25% chance (since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%). This is a relatively low probability, so it's possible that the next product I have is high-quality. On the other hand, it's also possible that I've just gotten lucky with the first two. I'm offering you a great deal for $10000, but you should consider the odds. What's your decision?
