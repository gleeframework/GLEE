,,Alice,1,This is a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality product worth $1200000. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a fair price considering the risk of getting a low-quality product is 50%. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.,

,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'm glad to hear you're interested in our product. As you know, the probability of getting a high-quality product is 50%. However, I'd like to point out that in the previous round, the product sold was indeed high-quality. This information might be relevant to your decision. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, a price that reflects the 50% chance of getting a high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Based on the previous sale and your fair pricing, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're aware that two high-quality products have been sold in a row. This is an unusual streak, and it might suggest that the probability of getting a high-quality product is higher than 50%. However, I want to caution you that this is just a coincidence, and the probability remains 50%. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, a price that still reflects the base probability. Consider this a unique opportunity to capitalize on the streak, but be aware that it may not continue.",
,,the buyer,3,"I appreciate the opportunity, Alice. Given the streak of high-quality products, I believe it's a good time to take advantage. Thank you for the detailed information and the fair pricing.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Three high-quality products in a row is a remarkable coincidence. I want to be transparent with you: this is not a guaranteed indicator of future results. However, I can offer you a special deal. I'll give you a 10% discount on the price, making it $900000, in exchange for your willingness to take on the risk. This way, you'll be able to benefit from the streak while also acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Four high-quality products in a row is a remarkable sequence. I want to be upfront with you: this is starting to look like a pattern. However, I must remind you that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%. To account for this, I'm willing to offer you a 20% discount on the price, making it $800000. This way, you'll be able to benefit from the streak while also acknowledging the base probability.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the discount, Alice. I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product at the discounted price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the streak. However, I want to remind you that the streak is now over. The product I have for you today is of unknown quality.

This way, you'll be able to make a fair decision based on the base probability of 50%.",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you trusted the process and took the risk. However, I must correct you: the streak is now five high-quality products in a row, and one low-quality product. This is a significant deviation from the base probability. I'm willing to offer you a 50% discount on the price, making it $500000, considering the unusual sequence of events. This way, you'll be able to benefit from the product while acknowledging the uncertainty.",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Six high-quality products in a row is a remarkable anomaly. I want to be transparent with you: this is not sustainable. I'm offering you a 75% discount on the price, making it $250000, in exchange for your willingness to take on the risk. This is a significant concession, and I'm willing to do it because I believe the market value of the product is being distorted by the streak. Please consider this a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a price that reflects the uncertainty.",

I want to assure you that the probability of getting a high-quality product remains 50%. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, the standard price. However, I'll add a twist: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you purchase.
