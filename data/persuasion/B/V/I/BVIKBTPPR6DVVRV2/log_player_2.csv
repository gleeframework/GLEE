**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  With 2 high-quality products sold out of 2 total, the success rate is 100%. This indicates a strong likelihood that the current product is also high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the purchase, which further strengthens the belief that the product is likely good.
* **Potential Gain:** Even if there's a 50% chance of being wrong, the potential gain of $120 outweighs the potential loss of $100. 

**It's important to note:** This decision is based on the given information. The game is simplified and doesn't account for potential biases or manipulation by Alice. In a real-world scenario, more information and analysis would be needed before making such a decision."
