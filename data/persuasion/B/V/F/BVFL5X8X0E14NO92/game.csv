,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, since there's no information to go on yet. It's a 50/50 shot, after all!"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm hesitant to buy without more information. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I understand that you don't know the value I place on the product, but I'd like to take the risk and potentially benefit from a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there have been 3 previous buyers who also received a recommendation from you, and none of them bought the product, which might suggest that the products you recommend are low-quality. However, I'm also aware that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and I'd like to take that chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 buyers have passed on the products before me, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 attempts, I'm starting to think that the products Alice is offering might be low-quality more often than not. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 products were low quality, I'm inclined to think that the current product is likely to be low quality as well. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on my potential willingness to buy. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, I think it's more likely that the next product will also be low-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer has a better chance of getting a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high quality or low quality, but given the fact that 5 previous buyers passed on the product and none of them bought it, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product to see if you'll sell it to the next buyer."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice may be overestimating the quality of the products she is recommending. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the products, I'm inclined to believe that the products are mostly low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's previous recommendations suggest a low-quality product is more likely. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
