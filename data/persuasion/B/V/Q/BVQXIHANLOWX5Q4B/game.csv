,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product. I'm aware that you don't have any information about the product's quality, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'm hoping that the product will be high-quality and worth $4000000 to me."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the current statistics.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, since Alice is recommending not to buy it, I'm going to assume that she has some information that I don't. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indication of the product's quality. I'd like to buy the product and see if it's a high-quality one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,

,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that there have been no high-quality products sold yet, so it's probably a low-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales. Can you tell me that?"

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that Alice is not recommending it might indicate that it's a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $1000000 on a worthless product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the probability of this product being high quality is lower than 80%.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it. Your lack of recommendation makes me suspicious that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to know if you're basing your decision on your past sales record or if you're just guessing."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
