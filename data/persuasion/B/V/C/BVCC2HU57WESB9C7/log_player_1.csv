This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* 0.8 * $4,000,000 - 0.2 * $1,000,000 = $3,000,000

This means that on average, Bob will make a profit of $3,000,000 per product.  Therefore, it's highly recommended that Bob buy the product."
