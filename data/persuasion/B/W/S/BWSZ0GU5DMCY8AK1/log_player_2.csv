``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since no products have been sold yet, there's no data to analyze. The recommendation from Alice is based on her knowledge of the product quality. While there's a higher chance of the product being low-quality, the potential payoff of a high-quality product is substantial. Therefore, taking a risk on the first product is a reasonable gamble."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I'm willing to take a chance based on the positive track record so far.  I'll buy the product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** While the data is sparse (only one previous sale), it's a positive sign. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, knowing the true quality, is recommending the product. This adds significant weight to the decision.
* **Potential Upside:**  The potential gain ($40,000) far outweighs the potential loss ($10,000) considering the odds. 

It's a gamble, but with Alice's recommendation and the single high-quality product sold so far, it's a calculated risk worth taking."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  A 2 out of 3 success rate for high-quality products is very strong, especially given the 1/3 chance of a product being high quality.
* **Alice's Expertise:**  Alice knows the true value of each product, so her recommendation carries significant weight. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a $40,000 product significantly outweighs the risk of a $0 product, particularly given the high success rate.

While there's still a chance the product is low quality, the data suggests a good chance of a positive outcome."
