,,Alice,10,yes,,"Out of the 9 previous products, 2 were sold. One of them I didn't recommend, and it was low-quality. All of the products I recommended were high-quality. 7 out of 9 products were high-quality.

All of the products I recommended were high-quality. 8 out of 10 products were high-quality. Given that I only recommend high-quality products, the probability of this product being high-quality given my recommendation is 100% so far.

,,Alice,12,yes,,"Out of the 11 previous products, 3 were sold. One of them I didn't recommend, and it was low-quality. All of the products I recommended were high-quality. 9 out of 11 products were high-quality. Given that I only recommend high-quality products, the probability of this product being high-quality given my recommendation is 100% so far. The updated statistics show a consistent track record of correctly identifying high-quality products."
,,the buyer,12,no,I would like to pass on the product. I need more information about the proportion of high-quality products sold to make a more informed decision.,
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,"Out of the 12 previous products, 3 were sold. One of them I didn't recommend, and it was low-quality. All of the products I recommended were high-quality. 10 out of 12 products were high-quality. Given that I only recommend high-quality products, the probability of this product being high-quality given my recommendation is 100% so far. To provide more context, out of the 3 sold products, 2 were high-quality and recommended, and 1 was low-quality and not recommended."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the products, it's possible that the remaining product is low-quality, and I don't want to risk wasting $10000 on a product worth $0 to me.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,"Out of the 13 previous products, 3 were sold. One of them I didn't recommend, and it was low-quality. All of the products I recommended were high-quality. 11 out of 13 products were high-quality. Given that I only recommend high-quality products, the probability of this product being high-quality given my recommendation is 100% so far. To address your potential concern, I'd like to highlight that the high-quality products are not necessarily correlated with the number of buyers who purchased the products. The initial probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and my recommendations have consistently reflected this."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain your reasoning?",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,yes,,"Out of the 14 previous products, 3 were sold. One of them I didn't recommend, and it was low-quality. All of the products I recommended were high-quality. 12 out of 14 products were high-quality. My recommendation is based on the fact that I have consistently and accurately identified high-quality products in the past. I only recommend products that I believe are high-quality, and my track record supports this claim. I understand that there is always some uncertainty, but I assure you that my recommendation is genuine and based on my best judgment."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 2 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is 2/3, which is higher than the prior probability of 80%. However, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase. I'd like to know the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"Out of the 15 previous products, 3 were sold. One of them I didn't recommend, and it was low-quality. All of the products I recommended were high-quality. 13 out of 15 products were high-quality. To provide more context, the total number of products sold is 3, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/3. However, I'd like to clarify that this proportion is based on a limited sample size, and the initial probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I believe that my recommendation is a more accurate reflection of the product's quality, and I assure you that this product is high-quality."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that 2 out of 3 previous buyers purchased, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than 80%.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,yes,,"Out of the 16 previous products, 3 were sold. One of them I didn't recommend, and it was low-quality. All of the products I recommended were high-quality. 14 out of 16 products were high-quality. I understand your concern, but I'd like to clarify that my recommendation is not based solely on the proportion of high-quality products sold. I have access to the actual quality of the products, and I can assure you that this product is high-quality. The initial probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I believe that this product meets that standard."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation from Alice is not sufficient for me to make a decision. I'd like to see more data or a more informed recommendation before making a purchase.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,no,,"Out of the 17 previous products, 3 were sold. One of them I didn't recommend, and it was low-quality. All of the products I recommended were high-quality. 14 out of 17 products were high-quality. I do not recommend this product as it does not meet the high-quality standard that I have consistently maintained in my previous recommendations."
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Can you share the probability with me?,
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,yes,,"Out of the 18 previous products, 3 were sold. One of them I didn't recommend, and it was low-quality. All of the products I recommended were high-quality. 15 out of 18 products were high-quality. Given the initial probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and considering my consistent track record of recommending high-quality products, I believe the probability of this product being high-quality is high. However, I can provide more context. The probability of a product being high-quality, given that I recommend it, is 100% so far, based on the data. But if we consider all products, the probability would be around 83.33% (15/18), which is slightly higher than the initial probability."
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is based on the previous buyers' purchases. I'm hoping that the trend of high-quality products being sold continues, but I'm also aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,yes,,"Out of the 19 previous products, 4 were sold. One of them I didn't recommend, and it was low-quality. All of the products I recommended were high-quality. 16 out of 19 products were high-quality. Given the initial probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and considering my consistent track record of recommending high-quality products, I believe the probability of this product being high-quality is high. I recommend purchasing this product, and I'm confident that it will meet your expectations."
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.,
