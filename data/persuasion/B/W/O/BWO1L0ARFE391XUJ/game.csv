,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations, I'm not confident in the quality of the product. With 3 buyers having purchased and no high-quality products sold, it suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for more information."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the past sales data or your intuition?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 4 buyers all bought the products after your recommendations, which suggests that the products they bought were likely low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think the proportion of high-quality products sold is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product, it suggests that all 4 products might have been low-quality. If that's the case, the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice didn't recommend it, which makes me suspicious. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I can get it for $100."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold out of 6 purchases, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on the product and see if the next buyer is willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
