,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the quality before making a decision, as I have no information about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, as I don't have any information to go on and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even with the lack of positive recommendations so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm worried that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product since the previous 3 buyers didn't take her advice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it seems like the products recommended by Alice are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a change in the pattern or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the initial 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation against it. I'm hoping to be the lucky one and get a high-quality product!"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I would like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not buying. Given that 6 out of 6 buyers didn't buy the product, and all of them received a recommendation from you not to buy, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is very low. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 previous buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm suspicious that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that you haven't recommended a single high-quality product to any of the 6 previous buyers, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics that 0 out of 6 products sold were high-quality, which is a very low success rate. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the statistics, all 7 previous buyers received a low-quality product since no high-quality product has been sold. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about buying this product. I'd like to know if Alice can provide more information about the product or the sales process before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and still no high-quality product has been sold, which makes me suspect that the products recommended to buy are likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for a different product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, I'll buy the product."
