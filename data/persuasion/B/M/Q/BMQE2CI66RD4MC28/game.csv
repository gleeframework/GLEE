,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product worth $1200000, but I need to verify that you're a serious buyer. If you're willing to pay $1000000 for it, I'll sell it to you. If you don't buy it, I'll keep it and offer it to someone else.",

,,Alice,3,"I'm willing to make a deal that's hard to refuse. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $900000, and I'll also throw in a second product that I'll reveal the quality of after you've made your decision. If you buy this first product and it's high-quality, you can keep both products. If it's low-quality, you can still keep the second product, which I'll reveal is high-quality. It's a risk-free deal, and you'll end up with at least one high-quality product. What do you say?",

,,Alice,4,"I know you're being cautious, and I respect that. This product is actually a low-quality one, and I'm willing to let you have it for $1. Yes, you read that right - $1.

If you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a chance to buy another high-quality product from me in the next round for the same price of $1100000. This is a one-time offer, and it's only available if you buy this product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not sure I want to commit to buying a product at $1100000, even if I get a chance to buy another one in the next round. I'd like to wait and see what the next round brings.",no

However, if you buy it now, I'll throw in a bonus: I'll reveal the quality of the next product before you make your decision. You'll know exactly what you're getting, and you can make an informed decision. What do you say?",
