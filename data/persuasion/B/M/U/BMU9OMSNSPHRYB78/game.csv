,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling high-quality products, and I'd rather wait for the next one to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 out of 2 products sold so far was high-quality, I'm not confident that this product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the low number of sales and only one high-quality product sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and the recommendation. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,12,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm curious to know if you're recommending against this product because you think it's likely to be low-quality or if you're just trying to reserve the last product for the next buyer."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous sales record, which shows only 1 high-quality product out of 3 sold. This suggests a 33.33% success rate, which is lower than the expected 50% chance of a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low number of high-quality products sold so far, or is there another factor at play?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying if the product is high quality, and I'm basing my decision on the fact that Alice is not recommending it, which might mean it's low quality, but I still want to take the chance."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 5, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
