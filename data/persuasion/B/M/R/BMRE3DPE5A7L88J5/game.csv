high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none have purchased suggests that the products recommended to them were low-quality. This makes me cautious and I'd rather wait for the next product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit her lack of information."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have bought the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that Alice is recommending low-quality products to all the buyers. I will pass on the product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,

,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is low-quality. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 previous buyers, I'm going to pass on the product."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she hasn't sold any high-quality products yet, so she's trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if Alice's recommendation changes based on more sales data."
