high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, it's likely that the products sold so far were low-quality. If I buy, I'll be paying $10000 for a product that's probably worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Is there a specific reason why you don't recommend buying this product?"

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
