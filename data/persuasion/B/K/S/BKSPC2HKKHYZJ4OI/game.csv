low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, as the statistics are not yet available to influence my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000. I'm taking a risk given the low quality rate of the products and the fact that the previous buyer was not recommended to buy it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers also passed on the products, and none of the products sold so far were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice has been recommending products that are likely to be low-quality, since 3 out of 3 products sold so far were low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product for now."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that Alice recommended it suggests it's more likely to be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a product worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think Alice's lack of recommendation might indicate a high chance of it being low quality. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not optimistic about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it, and considering the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. I'd rather not risk wasting my $1000000 on a product that might be worthless to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you recommended not to buy it. I'm hoping that the product is low quality and you recommended it because of the statistics, which suggest a low proportion of high-quality products have been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that since 6 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a product that's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and the potential loss of $1000000 is too high."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have already passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 7 buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products were sold, I'm going to pass on this product. I think it's likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to waste my $1000000 on something that's not worth it."
