,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the second buyer and she knows that the first buyer passed on the product. I'll take my chances."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you don't know my valuation, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations, as none of the previous 4 buyers purchased a high-quality product.

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when I know it's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,17,yes,
