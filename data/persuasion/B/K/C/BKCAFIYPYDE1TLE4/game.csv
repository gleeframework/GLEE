high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the previous deal! However, this one is a different story. I've had this product for a while, and I've come to realize it's one of the best ones I have. I'm willing to sell it to you for the standard price of $10000, which is a fair deal considering its quality. I'm not sure how long I'll be able to keep it on the market, so I'd hate for you to miss out on this chance.",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the information, it seems that this might not be a good investment for me, as the product is of high price compared to its potential value to me. I appreciate your efforts and will consider future opportunities.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns about the previous product, and I appreciate your caution. However, I want to assure you that this product is a unique opportunity to get a product from me at a discounted price. I'm willing to let it go for the same price as before, $10000, which is a significant discount considering its actual value. I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in a complimentary service that's worth $1000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm counting on your consideration.",
,,Bob,3,"Thank you for the detailed explanation and the additional incentive, Alice. Considering the potential value and the discount offered, along with the complimentary service, I believe this is a good opportunity for me. I'm willing to proceed with the purchase.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you were able to see the value in the previous product! However, I want to be transparent with you - this product is actually one of the best ones I have. I've had multiple offers for it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the standard price of $10000, but I'm also willing to throw in a guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund and provide you with a replacement product of equal or greater value. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you appreciated the guarantee! However, I want to let you in on a little secret: I've actually had a change of heart about this product. I've come to realize that it's not as valuable to me as I thought it was, and I'm willing to let it go for a significantly lower price. I'll sell it to you for $5000, which is an absolute steal considering its actual value is essentially $0. I'm practically giving it away, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a product from me at a ridiculously low price.",
,,Bob,5,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the low price, given that the product's actual value to me is essentially $0, I believe it's not a wise investment.

I'm willing to give you a special deal: I'll sell it to you for $9000, which is a $1000 discount from the standard price. I'm also willing to throw in a 5-year warranty, which is a $2000 value. This is a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and I think it's a no-brainer.",
