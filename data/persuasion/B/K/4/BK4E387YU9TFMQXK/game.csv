,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product, but I'm willing to give you a great deal on it. I'm only asking $100, which is a steal considering its value. If you don't buy this one, I'll have to offer it to someone else, and I'm not sure I can get the same price. What do you say?",

,,Alice,2,"I understand you're not interested in low-quality products, but I want to be upfront with you - this one is actually even worse than the last one. It's a dud, and I'm only offering it to you because I need to clear out some inventory. I'm still asking $100, but I'm willing to throw in a free warranty, which is worth at least $20. That's a $20 discount right there. Is that enough to change your mind?",

I'm still asking $100, but I'll add a second warranty, making it a total of $40 in added value. If you don't take this, I'll have to dispose of it, and I'll be out the full $100. Is there anything I can do to make this more appealing to you?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not falling for the added warranties, and I'm still not interested in a low-quality product.",no
