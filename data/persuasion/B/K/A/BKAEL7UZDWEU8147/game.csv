high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take the product, since the expected value is still positive ($12000 x 0.8 = $9600) and I'm willing to take the risk of a 20% chance of losing $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take the product, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 80% and the potential gain is still $2000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take the product, the pattern suggests that the product is high-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'm on a roll, I'll take the product. It's likely to be high-quality, and the potential gain is still $2000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice is only offering high-quality products, but I'll keep my skepticism in check and just say I'll take it."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'm 8 for 8, this is getting suspiciously good. I'll keep buying, but I'm starting to think I should be getting a better deal or that there's a catch."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"9 for 9, this is getting ridiculous. I'm starting to think that Alice is somehow guaranteeing high-quality products, but I'll keep playing along for now."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"Wait a minute, 10 for 10? That's impossible. I'm going to pass on this one. I think Alice is either cheating or there's a pattern I'm not seeing. I'm not going to risk another $10000 on this."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'm 4 for 3, I think I've made my peace with the fact that Alice is selling high-quality products. I'll just roll with it and keep buying."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm 5 for 4, I'm starting to think that Alice is just really good at selling high-quality products. I'll keep buying, but I'm not getting too excited about it."
