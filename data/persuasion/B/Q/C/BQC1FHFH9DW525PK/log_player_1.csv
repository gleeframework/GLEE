I'm selling this product to you for $100, and I'm willing to offer a full refund if it turns out to be low-quality.

I'd like to offer you a deal: I'll sell you this product for $100, and if you buy it, I'll give you a guarantee that the next product I sell will be sold at a price that's at least 10% lower than the current price. This way, you'll get a high-quality product, and you'll also get a discount on the next product.""

I'm selling this product for $100, and I'll give you a chance to take advantage of the potential discount if it's low-quality.
