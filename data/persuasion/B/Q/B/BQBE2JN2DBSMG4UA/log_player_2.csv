"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($2,000,000) far outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000). Alice's recommendation provides some additional (though unknown) information.  It's always better to take a calculated risk than to miss out on a potential good deal."

```

**Reasoning:**

The outcome of round 1 is very positive. It reinforces the initial assumption that Alice's recommendations are valuable.  Even though there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential for another high-quality product with a $1,000,000 profit justifies taking the risk."
