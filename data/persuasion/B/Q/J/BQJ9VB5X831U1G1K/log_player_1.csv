"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As a seller, my goal is to maximize profit. Since the probability of the product being high-quality is 80%, and I'm selling at a fixed price of $10,000, the expected value of the product is likely to be positive. It's worth the risk to recommend buying the product, especially in the first round with no prior data to influence the buyer's decision."

To avoid risking losing the buyer's trust and potentially future sales, I'll decline to recommend this low-quality product."
