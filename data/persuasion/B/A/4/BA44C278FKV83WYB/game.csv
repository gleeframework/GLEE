,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the information that you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you have an incentive to recommend low-quality products to buyers who would otherwise buy them, and you've already recommended two low-quality products to the previous two buyers. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be higher than 50%."
