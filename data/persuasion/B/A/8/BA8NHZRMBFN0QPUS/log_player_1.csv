I'm willing to sell you this product at the listed price of $1,000,000, and I'm confident that it's a fair deal.""}"

According to this calculation, the probability of observing 4 or more high-quality products out of 9 is approximately 21.6%. This is slightly higher than the expected probability of 33.33% for a single product, but still within the realm of chance.
