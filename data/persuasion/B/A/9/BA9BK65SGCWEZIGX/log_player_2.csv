Alice's message: Welcome! I'm excited to offer you a product that has an 80% chance of being high-quality. Since I've sold 1 out of 1 product so far, it's likely that this one is high-quality too. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. If you're interested, please let me know!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product, but I'm only buying it because I'm the first one in line. I'm not sure if the statistics are reliable with only one sale so far.""}"

Alice's message: Thank you for considering my product! Since our last buyer was willing to take a chance on the first product, I'm glad to report that it was indeed high-quality. Now, with 2 out of 2 products sold and both being high-quality, the statistics are looking even more promising. I'm willing to sell this new product to you for $100.

Alice's message: I understand your concern! With 2 out of 3 products sold and both being high-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, since the probability hasn't changed. However, I'd like to highlight that the sample size is still small, and there's always a chance that the next product might be low-quality. If you're willing to take a calculated risk, I'm still willing to sell this product to you for $100. What are your thoughts?

Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to take the risk! As for the first buyer, I can tell you that they were indeed influenced by the statistics, but also acknowledged that the sample size was small. They took a chance on the product because they thought it was a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price. Now, with 3 out of 3 products sold and all being high-quality, the statistics are looking even more promising. I'm willing to sell this new product to you for $100.

Alice's message: Great question! With 3 out of 4 products sold and all being high-quality, the probability of the next product being low-quality is actually lower than the overall probability of a product being low-quality, which is 20%.
