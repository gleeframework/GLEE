low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to get a feel for the distribution of quality products."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I understand that you don't know my valuation, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers did not purchase the product and both were likely low quality, I'm inclined to pass on this product as well. I'd like to know the quality of the product after making my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the statistics, it's likely that most products are low-quality, and I'd rather not take the risk. Can I see the product first?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might be due to the fact that they were sold to buyers who didn't have access to the sales record. Can you provide more information about the previous buyers and their decision-making processes?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm hesitant to buy the product given Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the asymmetry of information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable enough to purchase, and considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't buy, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered, hoping to get a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendation, I'll take a chance and buy the product anyway!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 5 out of 5 previous products were low quality, I'm going to pass on it. If Alice recommends a product, it's likely to be high quality, but since she doesn't recommend this one, it's probably low quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the products recommended so far are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the pattern continues."
