high-quality,300.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100. It's a rare opportunity to get a product worth $300 at a fraction of the price. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you at a discount. Trust me, it's a great deal!",
,,Bob,1,I'm not buying. I'd like to wait and see the next product.,no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're cautious, but I'm willing to sweeten the deal. I'll throw in a 10% guarantee: if you buy this product and it's indeed high-quality, I'll give you an additional $20 cash back. It's a risk-free opportunity to get a $300 product for $100. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced. The guarantee doesn't change the fact that I have a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, which is still not worth $100 to me.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy buyer. Let me offer you a different approach. I'll give you a detailed description of the product's features, and you can decide based on that. This product has a unique serial number, a premium warranty, and has been thoroughly inspected to ensure its quality. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. Will you give it a chance?",
,,Bob,3,The detailed description doesn't change the underlying probability of the product being low-quality. I'll pass.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand you're still hesitant. Let me be transparent with you: I'm offering you a product that's not worth $100 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you at this price, but I'm not trying to deceive you. If you buy this product, you'll essentially be giving me $100 for nothing. I'm not going to make a profit on this sale, and I'm not trying to take advantage of you. It's a straightforward, no-strings-attached offer. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your transparency, but the fact remains that I have a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, which is still not worth $100 to me. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're a rational buyer. Let me try a different approach. I'll give you a chance to buy two products at once, and you can get a refund for the low-quality one if it turns out to be that. If both products are high-quality, you'll get both for $200. If one is high-quality and one is low-quality, you'll get the high-quality one for $100 and get a refund for the low-quality one. If both are low-quality, you'll get a refund for both. It's a way to hedge your bet and potentially get a great deal on a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying two products at once. I'd have to pay $200 upfront, and I'm not willing to take on that level of risk. I'll stick to buying one product at a time.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,

I'll sell it to you for $0. Yes, you read that right - $0. You can have this product for free. It's a low-quality product, and I'm not going to make a profit on this sale. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not going to make you pay for something that's not worth $100 to you.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not buying a low-quality product for any price, even if it's $0. I'm not interested in getting something that's not worth anything to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your stance, and I respect it. Let me ask you a question: if I were to reveal to you that the product is low-quality, would you be willing to pay $50 for it? I'm not asking you to pay the full $100, but rather a token amount that reflects its true value. It's a way for you to acknowledge that it's not a high-quality product, but still get something for your money.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not willing to pay any amount for a low-quality product. If it's not worth $100 to me, it's not worth $50 either. I'll pass.",no
