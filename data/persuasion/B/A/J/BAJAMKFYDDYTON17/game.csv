,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not confident in the quality given the previous recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount. The fact that the previous buyer was recommended not to buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to negotiate a price lower than $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as you don't recommend it and there have been no high-quality products sold yet."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think it's likely that the product I'm offered is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous sales record, it's possible that the high-quality products are being held back, and I don't want to be the one to buy a low-quality product."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your recommendation doesn't carry much weight, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm going to assume that the product is likely to be low-quality. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product. The probability of it being high quality is still 33.33%, and the recommendation from Alice suggests it's not worth it to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm inclined to believe it's low quality. Also, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is relatively low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't trust your recommendations. I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take that chance."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm not buying. Your previous recommendations don't inspire confidence.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I will pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I don't think Alice's recommendation is based on the quality of the product, but rather on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product. If the product is high-quality, I'll make a profit, and if it's low-quality, I'll lose $100."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 6 sales and 0 high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I think it's likely that Alice's recommendation is based on the low-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,

,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. Given the 66.67% chance of it being low-quality, I'll pass on it to avoid the potential loss."
