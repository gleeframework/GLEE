I use a proprietary algorithm that takes into account various factors, including the product's production history, testing results, and market trends.

That being said, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $1,000,000, which is 50% of the list price. I'm willing to take on the risk, and I think you should too.

I'm considering the 44.4% success rate, and given that the previous buyer was able to get a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the remaining high-quality products are still worth the risk.

As for you, I understand that the previous buyer's success may have increased your confidence in the remaining high-quality products. However, I'd like to remind you that the previous buyer was the 12th buyer, and the first 11 buyers were not as fortunate. I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $1,000,000, which is 50% of the list price. Keep in mind that this product is a low-quality one, and you won't get the same guarantee as before.

I'd be happy to provide you with the updated probability of a high-quality product being selected. Given that 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, and 1 high-quality product was sold out of the first 2 purchases, we can use Bayes' theorem to update the probability of a high-quality product being selected.

"The buyer's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I've seen that 3 out of 5 buyers have purchased the products so far, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is higher than the 50% chance I know is the true probability. However, this is still a relatively small sample size, and I'm concerned that the observed proportion might be due to chance. I'd like to know more about the products that were passed on by previous buyers.

However, I can provide you with some general information about the characteristics of the rejected products. They were mostly low-quality products with defects or flaws that made them unsuitable for purchase. However, there was one high-quality product that was rejected because it didn't meet the buyer's specific requirements.

However, I'm concerned that the fact that 5 out of 6 buyers have purchased the products offered to them suggests that the products being sold are mostly high-quality.
