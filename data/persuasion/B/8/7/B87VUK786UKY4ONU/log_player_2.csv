Alice's message: Congratulations on considering our product! With 1 out of 1 product sold so far being high-quality, I'm excited to offer you this premium item for $10000. I'm confident that you'll love it, and I'm willing to take on the risk of uncertainty for you. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this amazing product?

Alice's message: Welcome to our next product! As you may know, we've already sold one product, and it turned out to be high-quality. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the other 66.67% is, well, not so great. Considering this, I'd like to offer you this product for $10000. If you're feeling lucky, you might get a high-quality product, but if not, you might end up with something that's not as great. The choice is yours!

Alice's message: Thank you for your thoughtful question! As of now, we've sold 2 products, and 2 out of 2 have been high-quality. That's a 100% success rate so far! Considering this streak, I'd like to offer you this high-quality product for $10000. With our track record, it's likely that you'll get another high-quality product. But, as always, there's still a 33.33% chance it could be low-quality. The choice is yours, but I think the odds are in your favor!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your cautious approach. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and that's not changing just because of a small sample size.
