{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to wait and see if the trend continues or if a high-quality product is sold in the next round.

However, the buyer's skepticism is understandable given the previous low-quality product. To alleviate their concerns, I'll make a more explicit recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
