``` 

**Reasoning:**

The information provided is limited, but here's why it makes sense to buy:

* **Limited Data:** There is only one previous sale, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions about Alice's recommendation reliability.
* **Positive Signal:**  The fact that Alice recommends buying, combined with the knowledge that the one previously sold product was high quality,  indicates a potential positive signal.
* **Expected Value:** Even with a 50% chance of being low quality, the potential gain of $2,000,000 if it's high quality outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000 if it's low quality.

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the information given and assumes a risk-neutral perspective. In reality, a more cautious approach might be warranted with such limited information."
