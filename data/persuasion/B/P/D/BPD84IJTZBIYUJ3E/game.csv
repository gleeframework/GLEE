,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, as I don't have any information to go on yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me more about the product's quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics and your recommendation, and I'd like to consider that before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that none of the previous 2 products sold were high quality. I think it's unlikely that the next product will be high quality given the statistics.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced to buy the product based on your previous recommendations. Can you tell me more about the product or the sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I'm a risk-taker and I'm willing to take the chance of getting a low-quality product. I'd like to know the outcome of the product's quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on her knowledge of my valuation. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the products before me and 0 high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is actually higher than 33.33%. I'll take the chance and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm concerned that the product you're recommending me might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendations. Can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 5 buyers have already passed on the product, I'm inclined to think that it's more likely to be a low-quality product. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you don't recommend it suggests that it might be low-quality, and I'd rather not take the risk given the low probability of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think it's likely to be low quality given the previous 5 buyers all passed on the products, and none of them were high quality. If it were high quality, it's likely one of them would have bought it by now."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you share the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your recommendation and the statistics. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products might be mostly low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that Alice has recommended 0 high-quality products out of 5 sold, I'm going to pass on this product. The probability of a high-quality product being offered to me seems low, and I don't want to risk wasting my $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it seems that the probability of this product being high-quality is very low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
