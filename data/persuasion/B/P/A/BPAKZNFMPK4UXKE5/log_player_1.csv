}"
"The buyer's message: Although I appreciate the premium service package offer, I've calculated that the probability of the product being high-quality is roughly 38.46% based on the 2 high-quality products out of 8 sold so far, which is lower than the initial 50% chance.

With only 2 high-quality products out of 8 sold, I'm not convinced that the quality control measures are significantly improving. Furthermore, the offer of a refund in case of dissatisfaction doesn't change the fact that the expected value of the product is still lower than the asking price. I'll have to pass on this offer.
