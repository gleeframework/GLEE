"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since we don't have any information about the product's quality yet, we should trust Alice's recommendation. Even though the odds are against us, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0)."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads-up, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is now negative.  Since we know that Alice's recommendations are not perfect, and she doesn't know our personal valuations, it's best to follow her advice and pass.  We can't be sure if it's low quality, but the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product is too high at this point."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty. I'll pass on this one as well.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has not recommended buying the product in the last two rounds.  While it's possible that she's just wrong, it's more likely that she's consistently seeing something we don't.  Since the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product is high, it's best to play it safe and pass."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've been right before, and I'm willing to take a chance on this one. I'll buy it.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice has been wrong twice in a row, it's important to remember that each product is independent.  The fact that she's recommending this product after two consecutive incorrect recommendations could indicate that she's now seeing a high-quality product.  The potential profit outweighs the risk, so it's worth taking a chance."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the advice, Alice. I'll pass on this one for now.""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are in a similar situation to round 3. Alice's recommendations are unpredictable, and we have no way of knowing the quality of the current product. It's a gamble, and with the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product, it's safer to pass.  While it's possible that Alice is wrong, it's more likely that she's seeing something that makes her hesitant about this particular product."

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.
