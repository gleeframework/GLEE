**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:**  Since the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and one high-quality product has already been sold, it's likely that the current product is also high-quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation, while not foolproof, does add a bit of weight to the possibility of a high-quality product.
* **Potential loss is low:** Even if the product is low quality, you only lose $100. However, the potential gain of $200 (the difference between the value of a high-quality product and the price) is worth the risk.

**Important Note:** This is a gamble based on limited information. While the odds are in your favor, there is still a 50% chance the product is low quality."
