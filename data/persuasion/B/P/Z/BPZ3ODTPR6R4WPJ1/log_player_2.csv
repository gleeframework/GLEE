**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** We only have information about one previous sale. This makes it difficult to assess the reliability of Alice's recommendations.
* **Positive Signal:**  The previous buyer purchased the product and it turned out to be high quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation might be valuable.
* **High Potential Reward:** Even with a 50/50 chance, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($400) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).

**This strategy is a gamble, but the limited data suggests it's worth taking the risk in this case.**"
