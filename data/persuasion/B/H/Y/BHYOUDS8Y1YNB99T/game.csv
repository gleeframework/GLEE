,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me if I were to buy. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'll take the risk, but I'm only buying because I'm the first one and there's no prior data to go by. I'm hoping the product is high quality and will be worth $200 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'm interested in the 20% chance of a high-quality product for $100, which is a good deal compared to the $200 value."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 2 purchases. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. The proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2, which is not very high. I'd like to know the total number of products sold before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendation is not very reliable. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2 purchases, it's possible that the recommendation is based on chance rather than a reliable indicator of quality. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision.

high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 products, which means 50% of the products sold were high-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
