,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this to get some information. I'm aware that Alice doesn't recommend it, but I'll take the risk."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on Alice's recommendation alone, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to wait and see what happens with the next buyer."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is high quality, given the low success rate so far."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the probability of a high-quality product being sold before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, I'd like to see more data before making a decision"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision before making my own, and I'm concerned that the previous buyer's decision might have been influenced by the product's quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the updated statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, only 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchases, which means the probability of a high-quality product is still 80.00%. However, since the previous buyer also received a recommendation to buy and didn't buy, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I will pass on the current product to get more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only one sale and no high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80.00%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the proportion of high-quality products in the pool. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far is a bad sign and Alice's recommendation is likely based on the low-quality products she's been selling."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both products were low-quality, I suspect Alice's recommendation is based on the product being low-quality. I'd like to see more information or a different approach before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, I'm worried that the product I'm being offered might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous products were low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, none of the previous products were high quality, which suggests that the probability of this product being high quality might be lower than 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
