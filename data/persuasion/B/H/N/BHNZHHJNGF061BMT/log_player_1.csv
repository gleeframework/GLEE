"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob doesn't know the quality of the product, the expected value of buying is positive:

* **Probability of high-quality:** 80%
* **Value of high-quality product:** $40,000
* **Probability of low-quality:** 20%
* **Value of low-quality product:** $0

**Expected Value:** (0.8 * $40,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $32,000

Since the expected value ($32,000) is greater than the price ($10,000), it's in Bob's best interest to buy the product."
