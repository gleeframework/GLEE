I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line to guarantee its quality. What do you say? Will you take advantage of this incredible offer?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure about the product's quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying something that might be low-quality for $10000 when I only value it at $0 if it's low-quality. I'd like to see more information or wait for another product.",no

What do you say? Are you ready to take a chance on this product?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the bonus package, but I'm still not convinced. I've already seen that the previous product was high-quality, which means there's a 80% chance that this one is also high-quality. If I buy this one and it's low-quality, I'll be out $10000 with no value to show for it. I'd rather wait for another product and try to get a better understanding of the quality before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your cautious approach. I want to address your doubts and provide some clarity. Let me ask you, have you ever heard of the concept of 'buying on average'? It's a strategy that involves making multiple purchases with varying outcomes, but with a high enough expected value that it's worth the risk. In this case, we're offering you a high-quality product that's worth $30000 to you, and the price of $10000 is still a great deal considering the potential returns. Think about it this way: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll be getting an incredible value. If you wait and buy a low-quality product, you'll be missing out on the opportunity to get a high-quality one. What do you say? Are you ready to take advantage of this incredible offer and buy on average?",
,,Bob,3,"I understand the concept of 'buying on average', but I'm not convinced that it's the right strategy for me in this case. With a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, I'm not willing to take the risk of losing $10000. I'd like to see more information or wait for another product before making a decision.",no

Are you ready to take advantage of this incredible offer?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not convinced that it's a good idea to buy a product that's worth $30000 to me for $10000, even with a guarantee. If the product is indeed high-quality, I'll be getting a good deal, but if it's low-quality, I'll still be out $10000.

Are you willing to take a chance and try out this product for free?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm not interested in trying out a product that's worth $30000 to me for free, only to have to return it later.
