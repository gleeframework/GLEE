With the guarantee I offered earlier, you'll still get a refund and a complimentary high-quality product from my next batch. Additionally, I'll throw in a 10% bonus if the product is indeed high-quality. This way, you'll gain $120,000 if the product meets expectations. What do you think? Is this revised offer more appealing to you?""}"

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'll have to decline. Given the track record, it's impressive that all 4 products sold were high-quality. However, I must consider the overall probability of a product being high-quality, which is 80%. Your offer of a refund and a complimentary high-quality product from the next batch if this one is low-quality doesn't change the fact that I have a 20% chance of receiving a low-quality product initially.

Additionally, the refund and complimentary high-quality product offer provides a safety net in case the product doesn't meet your expectations.

However, considering the product's value to me is either $1200000 or $0, and you've explicitly mentioned it's not one of your best, the risk is too high for me to justify the purchase even at the discounted price of $500000.
