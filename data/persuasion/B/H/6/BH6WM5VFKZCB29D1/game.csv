I'm not offering a discount, but I'm giving you a chance to buy a product that you know is valuable to you. If you buy it, you'll get a product that you know is worth at least $1000000, and you'll be getting a second high-quality product for the same price as the first one. Please consider this a rare opportunity to buy a valuable product at a price that you're already comfortable with.",

,,Alice,3,"I understand that you're looking for a better opportunity, but I want to give you a chance to reconsider. This high-quality product is a great value, and I'm willing to offer you a slight discount. I'll sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only doing it because I want to encourage you to buy a product that I know is valuable to you. If you don't buy it, I'll keep it and sell it to someone else, and you'll never know its true value.",

However, I'm only willing to sell it to you for $900000, which is a better deal than what others are offering.

,,Alice,5,"I'm willing to make a bold statement: this high-quality product is the best one I have left in stock, and it's worth at least $1200000 to anyone who buys it. I'm not just saying that to convince you to buy it, I'm saying it because it's the truth. I've had multiple offers from other buyers, and I've turned them down because I think you're the best fit for this product. If you don't buy it now, I'll regret it, and I'll be kicking myself for not selling it to you when I had the chance. So, I'll ask you directly: are you interested in buying this product for $900000?",
