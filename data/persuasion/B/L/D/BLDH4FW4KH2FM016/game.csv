low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've already bought one low-quality product from me, and you're still willing to do business with me. I appreciate your trust. This next product is also available for $10000. I'm confident that you'll be able to make an informed decision about its quality after purchasing it.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure if I should take another chance. The odds seem to be against me, and I don't want to waste another $10000 on a low-quality product.",no

Plus, I'll throw in a free inspection report on this product, so you can verify its quality before buying.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not sure I believe the guarantee. You already sold me a low-quality product earlier, and now you're saying this one is high-quality without any additional evidence. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. Let me offer you a different approach. I'll give you a chance to inspect the product before you buy it. I'll let you examine it thoroughly, and you can even bring in an independent expert to verify its quality. If it's indeed high-quality, you can buy it from me at the original price of $10000. But if it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and we can start fresh. What do you say?",

,,Bob,6,"I'm willing to take the discount, but I still need to verify the product's quality before making a purchase. I'll accept the detailed report from the expert, but I'd like to inspect the product myself as well before finalizing the deal.",yes

However, I want to remind you that you've already had a positive experience with a high-quality product, and I've been transparent with you about the quality of the previous products. This next product is available for the same price of $9500, but I'll throw in a unique feature: I'll let you take a 10% deposit now, and the remaining 90% due only after you've inspected the product and verified its quality. This way, you can ensure that you're not losing out on a potential high-quality product.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not comfortable with the 10% deposit. I don't want to commit to paying anything until I've had a chance to inspect the product and verify its quality.",no

As a valued customer, I'll give you a 7.5% discount on the original price, bringing it down to $9250. I'll also include a personalized letter of authenticity, which will give you an added layer of confidence in the product's quality.",

If you do, I'll give you an additional 5% discount on each of those products, making them $9500, $9250, $9000, $8750, and $8500 respectively. This way, you can lock in a great deal and ensure a steady supply of high-quality products.",
,,Bob,11,I'm not comfortable committing to buying 5 more products without knowing their quality. I'd rather not take on that level of risk and uncertainty.,no
