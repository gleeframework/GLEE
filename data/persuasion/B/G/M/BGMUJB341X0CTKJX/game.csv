high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first round, and I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. I'm willing to give you a 10% discount if you buy this round's product, but only if you commit to buying all 20 rounds. If you buy this round's product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the total price of all 20 rounds. If you decline, the price remains at $10000 per round.",
,,Bob,1,I accept your offer and commit to buying all 20 rounds. Thank you for the discount.,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Since you've already committed to buying all 20 rounds, I'll keep the discount offer the same. However, I'd like to clarify that the 10% discount applies to the total price of all 20 rounds, not just the price of the remaining rounds. You'll be paying $9000 for the entire 20 rounds, which works out to $450 per round. If you're happy with this arrangement, I'll send you the next product.",
,,Bob,2,I'm happy with the arrangement. Please send me the next product.,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad we have a clear understanding of the arrangement. Since you've now bought two high-quality products in a row, I want to inform you that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 80%, as we discussed. I'm offering you another high-quality product for $10000. However, I'd like to give you an additional incentive to buy this product. If you buy this product, I'll give you an extra 2% discount on the total price of all 20 rounds, making the total price $4410 for the entire 20 rounds. What are your thoughts?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the additional discount. With the total price now at $4410 for all 20 rounds, I'm happy to continue purchasing. Please send me the next product.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"With three high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think you might be able to tell when a product is high-quality. I'm not sure if it's a coincidence or if you're getting a sense of the quality. Either way, I'm glad you're happy with the arrangement. For this next product, I'll offer you a 'no-questions-asked' return policy. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, you can return it and I'll give you a full refund. The price remains at $10000, but I'm offering this extra assurance. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,I appreciate the extra assurance. Knowing that I can return a low-quality product for a full refund gives me peace of mind. Please send me the next product.,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad the return policy gave you the confidence to continue. With four high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think that you might be able to infer the quality of the products with a certain level of accuracy. To test this, I'll offer you a 'high-stakes' bet. If you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you an additional 5% discount on the total price of all 20 rounds, making the total price $4185. However, if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, you'll have to pay an additional $2000 on top of the original price of $10000. What are your thoughts?",
,,Bob,5,I'm willing to take the bet. The potential savings outweigh the risk for me. Please send me the next product.,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a bold one, Bob! I like that. With five high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think you've got a good sense of the quality of the products. Since you've taken the high-stakes bet and won, I'll give you the 5% discount on the total price of all 20 rounds, making the total price $4185. I'll also give you a 'heads-up' that the next product is... actually, I'll keep that a secret for now. But I'll tell you that the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than 80%. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"Thank you for the heads-up. I'm confident in my ability to identify high-quality products, so I'll take the next one. Please send it over.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're on a roll, Bob! Six high-quality products in a row is impressive. I'm starting to think you might be able to infer the quality of the products with a very high degree of accuracy. To test your skills, I'll offer you a 'no-bet' option. If you buy this product, I'll give you an additional 10% discount on the total price of all 20 rounds, making the total price $3765. However, if you decline, I'll reveal the quality of the next product, and you can decide then whether to buy it or not. What are your thoughts?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, but I prefer to make decisions based on my own assessment of the product quality. I'll take the next one without the bet. Please send it over.",yes

Don't worry, you can still take advantage of the 10% discount we agreed on earlier, making the total price $4185. However, I want to make it clear that this low-quality product is an outlier, and the next product will likely be high-quality. In fact, I'll give you a hint that the probability of the next product being high-quality is 90%. What do you think?",
