low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're a savvy buyer, I like that. I'll give you the numbers: out of the 1 product sold so far, 0 were high-quality. The probability of this product being high-quality is therefore 0%. I'm offering you a unique chance to make a purchase that could potentially bring you a significant return on investment. The price remains the same at $1000000. What do you say?",

With 2 high-quality products out of 3 sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 66.67%. I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this product at the same price of $1000000. I'm confident that this product will meet and exceed your expectations.",

,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, but I'd like to clarify the 5% discount.
