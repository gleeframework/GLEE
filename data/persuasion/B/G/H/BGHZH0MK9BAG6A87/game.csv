,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm the first buyer after all!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given Alice's recommendation. I'm curious about the reasoning behind her recommendation and would like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the odds based on the current statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 product, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'm not sure if I should trust Alice's recommendation, but I'll take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I believe the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33% and the potential reward is worth the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one and see if I can get a better deal or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products recommended by you have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from someone else or for you to reveal more information about the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the high probability of a low-quality product (66.67%), I'm inclined to believe that the current product is also likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a product worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it based on the previous sales record or something else?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,

,,Alice,12,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
