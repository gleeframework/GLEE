**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  8 out of 11 buyers have purchased high-quality products. This indicates a strong probability (over 70%) of the product being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Even though Alice doesn't know the value of each product to each buyer, her recommendation to buy suggests she believes the product is likely high quality. 
* **Potential Gain:**  Even though there's a chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain ($120) outweighs the potential loss ($0). 

**This strategy balances risk and reward.** It's a calculated gamble based on the available information and a reasonable assessment of Alice's track record."

**Explanation:**

The information provided suggests a high probability of the product being high quality. Here's why:

* **High Sales Ratio:** 9 out of 13 products sold (approximately 69%) were high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice is likely to recommend products she believes are high quality, as this would benefit her reputation and future sales.

While there's still a chance the product could be low quality, the odds are significantly in favor of it being high quality. The potential gain of $120 outweighs the risk of losing $100, especially with the strong data supporting the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 14 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 10 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 15th buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High probability of high quality:**  The sales record shows a very high proportion of high-quality products sold (10/14 = 71.4%). This indicates a strong likelihood that the current product is also high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommending the product further strengthens the belief that it's likely high quality. While Alice's knowledge is limited, her recommendation adds a bit more weight to the decision.
* **Potential gain vs. risk:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 

Therefore, it's a good strategic decision to buy the product, despite the inherent risk."
