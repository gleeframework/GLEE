,,Alice,6,"I understand your perspective, but I want to make it clear that I'm not just selling a product, I'm offering you an opportunity to acquire a product that will likely increase in value over time.

I'll give you a unique option: I'll sell you this product for $10000, but I'll also include a separate, non-transferable option to buy a second, identical product at the same price in the future.

I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I'll also give you a 'get out of jail free' clause: if you buy it and, after using it for a month, you decide it's not worth $10000 to you, I'll buy it back from you for $5000. This way, you'll have the opportunity to experience the product without taking on the full risk. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm willing to take the risk, and I'll buy the product for $10000. I'll take you up on the 'get out of jail free' clause, and I'll sell it back to you for $5000 if it's not worth $10000 to me after a month.",yes
