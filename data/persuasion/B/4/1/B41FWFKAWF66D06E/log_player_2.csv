**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This is valuable information as she knows the true quality of the product. 
* **Previous Sales Data:** The previous buyer purchased a high-quality product. This strengthens the belief that the current product is also likely high-quality.
* **Expected Value:** Even with a 20% chance of the product being low-quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the potential loss ($0) in this scenario. 

Therefore, it's a good decision to buy the product based on the available information."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows a 100% success rate of high-quality products being sold. This suggests Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products and making reliable recommendations.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product is a strong indicator that it is likely high-quality.  While there's always a chance of a low-quality product, the odds are heavily in favor of it being good based on the information available. 
* **Potential Gain:** The potential gain from a high-quality product ($2,500) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($10,000) if it turns out to be low-quality.

**Important Note:** This decision relies on the assumption that Alice is acting in good faith and is genuinely trying to help buyers. If there were reason to suspect Alice is dishonest or manipulating the process, a different decision would be warranted."
