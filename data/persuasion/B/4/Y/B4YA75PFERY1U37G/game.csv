high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"Alice, I appreciate your recommendation, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  You've had an amazing track record, but then you stopped recommending for two rounds, and both products turned out to be low-quality. Can you explain what's going on?  I need a little more information before I can trust your recommendation again."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"Bob, I understand your concerns. I can assure you that my recommendations are genuine and based on the quality of the product. I didn't recommend the previous two products because they didn't meet my standards. I'm glad I could save you from potential losses. This product, however, is of high quality, and I strongly believe it's worth the investment. I hope you can trust my recommendation again."
,,Bob,12,no,"Alice, I'm still trying to understand what's happening. Your recommendations have been incredible, but then you stopped recommending for two rounds, and one was low-quality, and one was high-quality.  Then you recommended again, and the product was high-quality.  Now you're recommending again.  Can you explain what's going on?  I need some more information before I can trust your recommendations."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"Bob, I see that you're trying to find a pattern in my recommendations. I can assure you that my goal is to provide you with the best possible products. The truth is, I have access to information about the quality of the products, and I use that information to make my recommendations. When I don't recommend a product, it's because I know it's not up to par. I'm not trying to manipulate you or create a pattern. I'm simply trying to help you make the best decisions. This product is of high quality, and I genuinely believe it's worth the investment. I hope you can trust my recommendation and give it a try."
,,Bob,13,no,"Alice, I'm still really confused. Your recommendations have been great, but then you stopped for a few rounds, and now you're back to recommending again.  I need to understand what's happening before I can trust your judgment again.  Can you tell me more about what changed?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"Bob, I understand that you're looking for clarity. I'll be as transparent as I can. The reason I stopped recommending for a few rounds is that the products didn't meet my standards. I have a certain threshold for quality, and if a product doesn't meet it, I won't recommend it. It's not about creating a pattern or playing a game; it's about providing you with the best possible options. When the products started meeting my standards again, I began recommending them. This product is of high quality, and I believe it's worth the investment. I'm willing to work with you to rebuild trust, and I hope you can give me the opportunity to prove myself again."
,,Bob,14,no,"Alice, I'm still waiting for an explanation about your recent behavior.  Your recommendations have been fantastic in the past, but your inconsistent approach lately makes me hesitant. I need to understand what's going on before I can make an informed decision. Please share some insight into your recent changes."

,,Alice,15,no,"Bob, I understand that you're still looking for answers. I apologize if my recent behavior has caused any confusion. I can assure you that my approach hasn't changed, but the quality of the products has. I've been recommending products based on their quality, and when the quality dropped, I stopped recommending. This product, unfortunately, is not up to par, and I won't recommend it. I'm willing to continue working with you to rebuild trust, and I hope that my consistent approach will eventually speak for itself."
,,Bob,15,no,"Alice, I'm very disappointed. You've been incredibly helpful in the past, but your recent behavior has made me lose trust in your recommendations. Until you provide an explanation for your inconsistent approach, I can't risk buying any more products without your recommendation.  It's time for me to take a break from this deal."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"Bob, I understand that I've lost your trust, and I don't blame you for taking a break. I want to assure you that my intention is to provide you with the best possible products. I've been recommending products based on their quality, and I've been consistent in my approach. However, I understand that my actions may not have been transparent enough. If you're willing, I'd like to start fresh and work with you to rebuild trust. This product is of high quality, and I believe it's worth the investment. If you're not ready to buy, I understand, and I hope that we can work together again in the future."
,,Bob,16,no,"Alice, I've decided to end our deal. Your recent behavior has made it impossible for me to trust your recommendations. I've learned a valuable lesson about the importance of transparency and communication in any partnership. Thank you for the opportunity, but I'm moving on."
