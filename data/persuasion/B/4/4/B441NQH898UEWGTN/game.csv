,,Bob,3,"Alice, you've said 'not particularly excited,' 'average,' and now 'doesn't really stand out.'  I'm starting to get the impression that you're not very confident in these products. I'll pass again. Let's see if you have anything more promising.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I don't blame you for being cautious, Bob. This product isn't going to change your mind, unfortunately. It's another subpar offering, and I wouldn't recommend it to you even if you were willing to take a chance. Let's just move on to the next one.",

I've finally got a product that I'm genuinely excited about, and I think it's worth your consideration. It's a high-quality offering that I believe will meet your standards. I'm not just saying that to try to make a sale; I truly believe in this product. If you're willing to give me another chance, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",

,,Alice,20,"Bob, I think we've reached the end of this experiment. I'm not going to try to sell you on this product because, frankly, it's not worth it. I've failed to deliver on my promises, and I don't blame you for losing confidence in me. I'm going to take this as an opportunity to regroup and re-evaluate my approach.
