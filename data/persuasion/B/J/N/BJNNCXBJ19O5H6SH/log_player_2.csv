**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  We only have a very small sample size (2 previous sales).
* **Alice's Recommendation:** While not perfect, Alice's recommendation carries some weight. Since she has seen the product's quality, her recommendation is valuable.
* **Potential Upside:** The potential reward of a high-quality product ($40,000) is significant compared to the price ($10,000).
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low quality, the worst-case scenario is losing $10,000. However, the potential gain outweighs the risk. 

**In short, the potential for a high-quality product and Alice's recommendation make buying the product the better decision in this scenario.**"
