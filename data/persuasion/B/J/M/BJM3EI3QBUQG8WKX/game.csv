,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, and considering the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm not confident that this product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on Alice's past recommendations, she has recommended 3 products to be bought out of 3, which means all of them were high-quality. This is suspiciously high.
