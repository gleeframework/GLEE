,,Alice,1,"This product is a rare and unique opportunity to help me reach a milestone in my sales. I'm looking to sell it to you for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this again. What do you say?",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in the product! As you know, 80% of my products are high-quality. I've already sold 1 product in the past, and it was high-quality. That means the probability of this product being high-quality is 80%. However, I'd like to highlight that the previous product was low-quality, which might make you think it's a fluke. But, I assure you that my products are randomly selected, and the probability remains the same. This product is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a fixed price of $1000000. What do you say?",

However, I'd like to point out that the fact that the first product was low-quality and the second product was high-quality might suggest that the products are randomly distributed. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000, and I'm confident it's a great value. What do you think?",

I've sold 3 products now, and 1 of them was high-quality.

I'm offering this product to you for $1000000, and I'm confident it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item. However, I want to give you a special offer: I'll give you a 50% chance to get a refund if this product is indeed low-quality. What do you say?",

,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. I'm tempted by the discount, but I'm also cautious about the potential impact on future products' value. Given the trend of the last two high-quality products, I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm hoping it's indeed high-quality and worth $1200000 to me.",yes
