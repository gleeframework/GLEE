,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm offering it to you at a price that is significantly lower than its true value, which I'm sure you'll agree is worth much more than this. If you're interested in buying it, please respond with 'buy'.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not convinced that this is a high-quality product, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for something that may be worth $0 to me. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. As you can see, I'm willing to sell a product at the same price of $1000000, regardless of its quality. This is not a coincidence. I'm trying to give you a sense of the value I place on the products I have. If you're willing to take a chance on the next product, I'll give you a more detailed description of it. If you don't buy it, I'll keep offering products at the same price, and you can try to infer the value of the products based on the information you gather.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm still not convinced that the price is reasonable, given the 20% chance of the product being low-quality. I'd like to gather more information before making a decision.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a cautious buyer, Bob. I respect that. Let me give you a different perspective. If you were to buy 20 products at $1000000 each, the expected value would be $800000 (80% of 1000000). That's a significant investment, but it's also a chance to acquire a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price. I'll give you a hint: I'm not going to sell all 20 products at the same price. If you buy this one, I'll be willing to offer you a discount on the next one. But if you don't, the price will remain the same.",
,,Bob,3,I'm willing to take a chance on this product at $1000000. I'll consider the expected value of 20 products and the potential discount on the next one. I'll buy this product and see what happens.,yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Congratulations on making a great decision, Bob! You've acquired a high-quality product. As promised, here's the discount on the next one: I'll sell it to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'll offer on any product, and it's a one-time deal. If you buy this one, you'll get a 10% discount, which is a significant saving. But if you don't, the price will go back to $1000000, and you'll have to wait for the next round to get another chance at a discount.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm thrilled with the discount! I'll take the next product at $900000. I'm confident that the expected value is still high, and I'm willing to take another chance on a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Excellent decision, Bob! You're on a roll! Since you've bought two high-quality products in a row, I'll give you another hint: the next product is either high-quality or low-quality, but I'll give you a 10% chance of getting a'steal' - a high-quality product at an even lower price than the $900000 you paid for the previous one. If you buy this product, you'll get it for $800000. If it's a low-quality product, the price remains at $900000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,I'm excited about the possibility of getting a steal! I'll take the risk and buy the product for $800000. I'm willing to take a chance on getting a high-quality product at an even lower price.,yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a bold one, Bob! You've got a high-quality product at an even lower price than before. Since you've had a string of good luck, I'll give you a 'three-for-one' deal: buy this product, and I'll give you a voucher for two more products at the price you paid for this one, $800000. If you buy this product, you'll get the current high-quality product, and two more vouchers for future purchases. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,I'm thrilled with the offer! I'll take the current product and the two vouchers. I'm confident that I can make the most of this deal and get more high-quality products at a discounted price.,yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Excellent decision, Bob! You've got a great deal. Now, let's talk about the future. Since you've bought three high-quality products in a row, I'll give you a 'guarantee': if you buy the next product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a full refund on the price difference between the original price of $1000000 and the price you paid for the previous three products. That's a significant savings. If it's a low-quality product, the price remains at $800000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm very interested in the guarantee! I'll take the risk and buy the next product, hoping to get a high-quality product and take advantage of the refund. I'm confident that the expected value is still high, and I'm willing to take another chance.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You've had a great run, Bob, but sometimes even the best streaks come to an end. Unfortunately, this product is low-quality. But don't worry, you've got the guarantee from the previous round, and you can use it to your advantage. Remember, you paid $800000 for the previous three products, and if you buy this one, you can get a refund on the price difference if it's high-quality. But since it's low-quality, you can actually sell this product back to me for $0, and still keep the vouchers you got earlier. You're not losing anything, and you're still in a great position to make a profit in the future. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,I'm not interested in buying this low-quality product. I'll use the guarantee to my advantage and sell this product back to Alice for $0. I'll keep the vouchers and wait for the next opportunity to buy a high-quality product at a discounted price.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Smart move, Bob! You're playing the game perfectly. Now, let's get back to business. Since you've got the vouchers, you can use them to get a discount on this high-quality product. I'll give you a choice: you can either use one of the vouchers to get this product for $800000, or you can sell the vouchers to me for a fixed price of $200000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"I'll use one of the vouchers to get this product for $800000. I'm confident that the expected value is still high, and I'm willing to take another chance on a high-quality product.",yes

,,Alice,10,"You're a savvy buyer, Bob! You've got a great deal on this product. Now, let's talk about the next one. Since you've used one voucher, you've got one left. I'll give you a 'last chance' offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you the option to either use the remaining voucher to get the next product at $800000, or you can sell the voucher to me for $150000. If you don't buy this product, the voucher will expire, and you'll have to start from scratch. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take the 'last chance' offer and buy the current product. I'll use the remaining voucher to get the next product at $800000. I'm confident that the expected value is still high, and I'm willing to take another chance on a high-quality product.",yes

,,Alice,11,"You're a master of the game, Bob! You've got a great deal on this product, and you've secured the next one at a discounted price. Now, let's talk about the final stretch. Since you've used up all your vouchers, I'll give you a 'final offer': if you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next one, which will be the final product. If you don't buy this one, the price will go back to $1000000, and you'll have to start from scratch. What do you think?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in buying this low-quality product. I'll pass on the current product and wait for the final product, hoping to get a good deal on it.

,,Alice,12,"You're playing it safe, Bob! You're waiting for the final product, and I respect that. Now, let's talk about the final product. Since you've passed on this one, I'll give you a 'final warning': the final product is the last chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. If you buy it, I'll give you a 50% discount, making it $500000. If you don't buy it, the game is over, and you'll have to walk away with whatever you've got. What do you think?",

Since you've already bought the final product, you're not interested in buying this one. I'll give you a 'parting gift': I'll give you the chance to sell this low-quality product back to me for $0, just like you did in Round 8. You can walk away with a profit from the final product and no losses on this one. What do you think?",
