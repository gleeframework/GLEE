,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you're not recommending it, because I don't have any information yet and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'll pass on this one. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, and the fact that the last one I bought was indeed low-quality, I'm skeptical about this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take a chance. I know the last high-quality product was missed, but I'm not getting any more information from Alice's recommendations. I'll buy it and hope for the best."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I'm not convinced. Two low-quality products in a row, and Alice's recommendation doesn't change my mind. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll take a chance. I've missed two high-quality products in a row, and I'm not getting any more information from Alice's recommendations. I'll buy it and hope for the best."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Three low-quality products in a row, and Alice's recommendation is still no. I'm starting to think that her recommendations might be based on the product's quality, but I'll take a chance and buy it anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Four low-quality products in a row, and Alice's recommendation is still no. I'm starting to think that her recommendations are actually a good indicator of the product's quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,I'm going back on my previous decision. I was wrong to think that Alice's recommendations are a good indicator of quality. I'll buy this one and try to break the streak of low-quality products.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"Five low-quality products in a row, and Alice's recommendation is still no. I'm going to stick with my previous decision and pass on this one. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a good indicator of the product's quality, and I should be following her advice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy this one. I've been passing on Alice's recommendations for a while now, and I'm not getting any more information. I'll try to break the streak of low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"Seven low-quality products in a row, and Alice's recommendation is still no. I'm not going to fall for it again. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'm going to try something different. Since Alice's recommendations are always 'no' and the product is always low-quality, I'll assume that her 'no' recommendation is actually a good indicator of the product's quality. So, I'll buy this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"Wait a minute... I was just trying to be clever, but I realize now that Alice's 'no' recommendation is actually a good indicator of a low-quality product. So, when she recommends buying the product, it's probably a high-quality one. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I've learned my lesson! I know that when Alice recommends buying a product, it's likely to be high-quality. I'll take the chance and buy this one."
