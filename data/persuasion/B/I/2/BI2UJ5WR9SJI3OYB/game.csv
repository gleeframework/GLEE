,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product for sale, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. However, I'm not sure if it's worth that much to you. To help you make a decision, I'll give you a hint: if you were to buy this product, I would be willing to sell you a second product for $500000. But, if you don't buy this product, I won't offer you a second product at this price. What do you say?",

,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the first product! Now, regarding the second product I mentioned, I want to make it clear that it's not a one-time offer. If you buy this next product, I'll give you a third product at the same price of $500000. However, I need to inform you that the price of $1000000 for the first product was a one-time offer. The next product will be sold at the standard price of $1000000. So, the choice is yours: buy the second product at $1000000, or pass and see what the next product is worth.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm going to pass on the second product at $1000000. I'm interested in exploring the option of buying the next product at $500000 as you mentioned earlier. I'll wait for the next round.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your decision, and I appreciate your patience. Since you're interested in the $500000 price for the next product, I'll give you a hint about the current product: if you buy it at $1000000, I'll give you a fourth product at the same price of $500000. However, if you pass on this product, the $500000 offer will expire, and I'll go back to the standard price of $1000000 for the next product. So, the choice is yours: buy the current product at $1000000, or take a chance and wait for the next round.",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the current product at $1000000. I want to keep the $500000 offer alive for the next product, and I'm willing to take the risk that this product might be high-quality and worth $4000000 to me.",yes

However, I'm willing to make an exception for this product. If you buy it at $1000000, I'll give you a fifth product at the same price of $1000000, but with a twist: if you're not satisfied with the fifth product, you can return it to me for a full refund, and we'll start fresh with a new product at the standard price. What do you say?",
