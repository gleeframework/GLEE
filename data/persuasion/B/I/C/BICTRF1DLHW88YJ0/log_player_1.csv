I'm willing to offer you a 10% discount on the price if you buy. Is it worth the risk?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the risk and buy the product, but I want to clarify that I'm only doing so because of the discount. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the statistics, but the discount makes it more appealing.
