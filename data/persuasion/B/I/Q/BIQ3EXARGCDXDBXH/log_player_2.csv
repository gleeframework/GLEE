Since we've sold 1 out of 1 product so far, and that one was high-quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%!

Alice's message: Ahah, excellent question! I'm happy to reveal that the quality of the products is determined by a combination of factors. Each product is randomly selected from a pool, but the pool is curated to ensure that the products are of a certain quality. The pool is made up of products that have been tested and evaluated by our team, and we use a proprietary algorithm to determine the quality of each product. The algorithm takes into account various factors, including the product's performance, durability, and customer reviews. The goal is to ensure that the products are of high quality and meet our standards. Would you like to take a chance and try to continue the streak, or would you rather play it safe?

Our algorithm is designed to ensure that the pool of products is diverse and representative of the overall product range.
