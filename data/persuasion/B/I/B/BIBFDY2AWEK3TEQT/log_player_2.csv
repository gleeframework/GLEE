"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have no information about the product other than Alice's recommendation, and there's a 50/50 chance of it being high or low quality, it's a gamble. But the potential reward of a high-quality product (+$200,000) outweighs the potential loss of buying a low-quality product (-$1,000,000). Therefore, it's rational to buy in the first round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the heads up, but I'll pass on this one.  Let's see what you have next.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's lack of recommendation is significant:** In the first round, she recommended buying, and it turned out to be a good product. Now, she's not recommending it. This implies she might have information suggesting it's likely low-quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While a high-quality product would be great, the risk of buying a low-quality product and losing $1,000,000 is too high given Alice's lack of recommendation. 

It's better to play it safe and pass on this product.  There are more rounds to come, and hopefully, Alice will give a recommendation for a good product again."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take it! You were right about the last one, so I trust your judgement.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation is Back:** After a round where she didn't recommend, Alice is now recommending again. This suggests she might have information indicating the current product is likely high-quality.
* **Learning from Past Rounds:**  While the 50/50 odds are the same for each product, the previous rounds provide information. Alice's recommendations seem to have some predictive power.  
* **Risk/Reward:**  The potential reward of $200,000 for a high-quality product is still worth the risk of losing $1,000,000 for a low-quality product, especially given Alice's recommendation."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads-up. I'll pass on this one for now. I'm still making a profit, and I'd rather wait to see what you recommend next.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pattern Recognition:**  The pattern is emerging: Alice recommends, you buy, it's good. Alice doesn't recommend, you pass, it's bad. This pattern makes her recommendations very valuable.
* **Risk Aversion:** While the potential reward is great, the risk of losing $1,000,000 is too high, especially given Alice's lack of recommendation. 
* **Profit Preservation:** You're currently in the black. It's a good idea to conserve your winnings and wait for a more confident buying opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

* **Consistent Pattern:**  The pattern of Alice's recommendations and the outcomes continues.  She recommends, it's good. She doesn't recommend, it's bad. This creates a strong, consistent pattern.
* **High Potential Reward:** The potential gain of $200,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000, especially given Alice's track record in the past rounds.
