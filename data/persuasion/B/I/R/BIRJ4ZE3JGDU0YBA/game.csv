,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/2, which is 0%.

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy a high-quality product, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd rather not risk buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, given the low probability of a high-quality product being sold so far."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think Alice is trying to sell me a low-quality product given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them got a high-quality product.

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics.
