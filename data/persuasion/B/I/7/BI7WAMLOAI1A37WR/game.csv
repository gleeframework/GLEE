,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, but neither of them purchased, it suggests that both products were likely low-quality. I'm hesitant to buy a product with a 50% chance of being worth $0 to me, especially with the seller's track record of not selling any high-quality products so far."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data.
