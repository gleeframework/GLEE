,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous two buyers received low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product as well. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000, considering the potential reward of getting a high-quality product worth $1200000."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that none of the previous three buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800000. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended against it, which suggests it might be low quality, but I'm willing to take the risk for a discounted price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products have been high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, all 5 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I will pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable enough to buy after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are biased towards discouraging sales. Given the low probability of a high-quality product (33.33%), I'm skeptical that this product is high-quality, and I'd rather pass on it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers purchased the product despite Alice's recommendation, and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect Alice is manipulating the recommendations to make me buy a low-quality product. I will pass on this opportunity."
