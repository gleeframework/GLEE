I'll send you a letter of authenticity from the manufacturer, verifying that this product is indeed high-quality. I'll also include a certificate of quality control, signed by the person who inspected it. I'm not asking you to take my word for it; I'm giving you concrete evidence. What do you say?",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I think we've been around the block a few times now, and I'm starting to think you're just playing a game of 'wait and see'.

I'll even give you a unique serial number that matches the one on the product you inspected, so you can verify it's the same model. I'm not asking you to take a chance; I'm giving you concrete evidence. What do you say?",

,,Alice,17,"I think we've reached a stalemate, and I'm willing to concede. I'll be upfront with you: this product is not high-quality. It's a lower-end model, and I'm not expecting you to be interested. I'll offer it to you for $0, yes, you read that right, free. I'll take a loss on this one, just to get it out of my inventory. I'm not expecting anything in return, and I'm not trying to sell you anything. I just want to clear out this product and move on.",
