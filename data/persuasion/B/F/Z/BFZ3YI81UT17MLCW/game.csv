high-quality,120.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the recommendation is based on no prior sales data, so I'm taking a risk. I'll be watching the future sales to see if the recommendation changes."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I want to see more data before making a purchase.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is 100%. However, considering the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the assumption that the recommendation is not reliable and I'm just trying to get more information for future reference."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'd also like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the previous sales record. With 2 high-quality products sold out of 2 products sold, the probability of the current product being high quality is 0.5. However, considering the underlying probability of a product being high quality (80%), I'd like to ask: given the previous sales record, is it more likely that the previous 2 high-quality products were just a coincidence, or is there a bias in the selection process that led to these results?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is based on the true quality of the product, but rather on the fact that the previous two buyers bought it."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision based on your recommendation. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being recommended to me?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think the probability of it being high-quality is not high enough based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far, to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your recommendation and the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the product. This suggests that the products being sold may be of high quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the probability of it being high quality, not Alice's recommendation."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as your previous recommendations were not based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I was the 5th buyer. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
