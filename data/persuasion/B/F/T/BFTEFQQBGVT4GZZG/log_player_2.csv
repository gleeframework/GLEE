I've had great success with this type of product in the past, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Plus, think about all the money you'll save by getting it for $10000! It's a steal, if you ask me. So, are you ready to take another chance on a great deal?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
