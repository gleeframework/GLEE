,,Alice,1,"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a great item, but I want to be transparent with you - I don't have any additional information to share about its quality.",
,,Bob,1,"Since the price is $100 and there's a 50% chance it's high quality (worth $200), my expected value is $100. I'll take the chance this time.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Hi Bob, another great product here. I still can't provide any extra details about its quality, but I want to remind you that your decision last round didn't quite pay off. Maybe consider that when making your decision this time.",
,,Bob,2,One low-quality product doesn't change the overall probability. The expected value remains the same - $100. I'll buy this one too.,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,

,,Bob,3,"Two low-quality products in a row don't affect the probability of the next product. Each round is independent. The expected value remains $100, so I'll buy this one too.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Hi Bob, you finally got a good one last round. However, as you said, each round is independent. I'm not going to try to sway you with patterns or trends. Just remember that the odds are still 50/50, and it's your call.",
,,Bob,4,"Glad I got a high-quality one last time, but as you said, each round is independent. The probability remains 50%, and the expected value is still $100. I'll keep buying.",yes

,,Bob,5,"Thanks for the acknowledgement, Alice. Indeed, nothing has changed - the probability is still 50%, and the expected value remains $100. I'll continue buying.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hi Bob, another round, another decision. I've been thinking - you've been very consistent in your approach so far. I wonder, are you planning to buy every single product I offer, as long as the probability remains 50%?",
,,Bob,6,"You've caught on, Alice. As long as the probability remains 50% and the price is $100, my expected value is $100, and it makes sense for me to buy every time. I'll keep buying until the conditions change.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Hi Bob, I have to admit, I'm impressed by your commitment to your strategy. Since you've already decided to buy every time, I won't bother trying to persuade or dissuade you. The product is here, and the price is still $100. Take it, as you said you would.",

,,Alice,8,"Hi Bob, business as usual, I suppose? I've got a product, you've got a strategy, and the price is still $100. Nothing new to report here. Just another round, another decision that's already been made.",
,,Bob,8,"You're right, Alice. Business as usual. The probability remains 50%, the price remains $100, and my expected value remains $100. I'll buy this one too, just like all the others.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Hi Bob, I think we can both agree that these messages have become somewhat... redundant. You know the drill, I know your strategy, and the conditions haven't changed. So, I'll just say: the product is here, and it's yours for $100, as always.",
