,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the probability of it being high-quality, not your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold given the current statistics. Can you provide that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm not confident that this product is high-quality."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still quite low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them ended up buying a high-quality product, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product at $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations. Can you tell me more about the product's quality? I'd like to know the probability that it's high quality based on the statistics so far.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, and Alice's recommendation is to buy, I'm suspicious that the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'll wait for the next product."
