A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I have a high-quality product this round. Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and there is no information about past sales, there's no reason for them to think this product is any different. Therefore, I recommend selling it."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record and a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the previous buyer declined, it doesn't change the inherent probability of this product being high-quality. It's still 33.33%.  The buyer has no information about this specific product and still only knows the general probability.  I recommend selling it."
"The buyer's message: Since there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality and you don't have any sales record yet, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains the same.  The buyer has no way of knowing this specific product is different from any other. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, and there is no new information to suggest otherwise.  Therefore, I recommend selling the product."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round's product is again high-quality, and the buyer still has no information to suggest otherwise. The probability of it being high-quality remains at 33.33%, and there's no reason for the buyer to change their stance. Therefore, I recommend selling the product."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time we have a low-quality product. While the buyer still only knows the general probability of 33.33% for a high-quality product,  they are now aware that we have offered 4 products without any sales.  This suggests that we may be selling low-quality products more often.  It is more prudent not to recommend selling this product."

The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the last product was low-quality, the buyer's decision to trust my recommendation is a positive sign. It indicates that they may be willing to consider my assessment in the future. This round's product is high-quality, and I should still recommend it. The buyer may be more open to the offer since they trust my judgment, and the general probability of 33.33% for a high-quality product hasn't changed."
"The buyer's message: Since there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality and no previous sales records to rely on, I'd rather not take the risk.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer is not buying the product despite my recommendations. They are only relying on the general 33.33% probability and not taking into account my track record.  This product is low-quality, and I have already recommended a low-quality product before.  The buyer is unlikely to change their mind based on the 33.33% probability alone. It's best not to recommend the product."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product and there are no previous sales statistics to rely on, I will trust her recommendation and pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

```

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round's product is high-quality. Although the buyer has a history of trusting my recommendations (and passing on products when I don't recommend them), they haven't bought anything yet. There is a chance they might be willing to take a chance on a high-quality product.  Since the buyer doesn't seem to be factoring in the probability of a high-quality product, I should recommend this product to them."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record and a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

```

**Explanation:**
