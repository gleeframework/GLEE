low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3. Given the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, I would expect the proportion of high-quality products sold to be around 0.8. The fact that the proportion is 1/3, which is significantly lower than expected, suggests that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. Therefore, I would like to pass on the current product."
