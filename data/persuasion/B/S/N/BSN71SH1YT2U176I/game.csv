high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm only selling it to you because I think you might value it more than I do. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'm not sure they'll pay as much as I think you will.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not sure I want to pay $10000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns about the value of the product. However, I'm willing to offer you a deal on this one. I'll sell it to you for $5000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. I'm only offering this deal because I think this product is not as valuable as the one I showed you last round, and I'm willing to take a loss on it to get it off my hands.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that this product is worth $5000, let alone $10000. I'll pass on this one too.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm starting to think that you're not interested in buying from me at all! I'm willing to offer you a deal on this one too, but this time I'll go even lower. I'll sell it to you for $2500. I'm basically giving it away at this point, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm wasting my time trying to sell to you.",
,,Bob,3,"Okay, fine. I'll take it. But I'm only doing this because I think you're getting desperate and I don't want to waste any more of your time. I'm buying it for $2500.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Ha! I knew you'd come around eventually! Now that you've taken a chance on the low-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a deal on this high-quality one. I'll sell it to you for $8000. I think you'll see the value in this one, and I'm willing to give you a discount because I know you're willing to take a chance on my products.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not convinced that this product is worth $8000, especially after wasting $2500 on the last one. I'm not going to fall for another potential trap.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. But I'm willing to offer you a guarantee on this one. If you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $2500, and we can even discuss a potential discount on the next product. I'm not making any promises, but I think this one is a good opportunity for you to get a great deal.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not sure I trust your guarantee, and even if I did, $2500 is still a long way from the $8000 you're asking. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm not surprised you're skeptical about the guarantee, but I'm willing to sweeten the deal. I'll sell this product to you for $2000, and I'll also throw in a small gift, a product of equal or lesser value, absolutely free. This way, you're not risking much, and you might even get a nice bonus out of the deal.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in taking a chance on another potentially worthless product, even with a 'free' gift. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I think I've made it clear that I'm willing to sell at a discount when the product is low-quality. Now, I'm going to try a different approach. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for the full $10000, but I'll throw in a guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked. I'm confident that this product is worth the investment, and I think you'll see the value in it.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm still not convinced that this product is worth $10000 to me, even with a refund guarantee. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I think I've been clear about the value of my high-quality products, and I'm willing to offer you a compromise. I'll sell this product to you for $9000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I'm not getting any younger, and I'd rather get something for this product rather than having it sit on my shelf. I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",
,,Bob,8,I'm still not willing to pay $9000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm starting to think we're at an impasse. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $8000, which is the same price I offered it to you earlier. I'm not making any promises about its value, but I'm willing to take on some of the risk. If you're not satisfied, you can always try to sell it to someone else.",
,,Bob,9,"Fine, I'll take it for $8000. I'm not getting any younger either, and I might as well take a chance on a product that could be worth $40000 to me.",yes

,,Alice,10,"Ha! I knew you'd come around eventually! Now that you've taken a chance on two high-quality products, I'm willing to offer you a deal on this one. I'll sell it to you for $9500, which is a slight premium over the last one. But I think you'll see the value in this one, and I'm willing to give you a slight discount because you've shown you're willing to take a chance on my products.",
,,Bob,10,I'm not going to fall for the same trick again. I'll pass on this one.,no
