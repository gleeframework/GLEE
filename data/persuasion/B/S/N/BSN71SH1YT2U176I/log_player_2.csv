"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm only selling it to you because I think you might value it more than I do. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'm not sure they'll pay as much as I think you will.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to pay $10,000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this one.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2

I'll sell it to you for $5000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. I'm only offering this deal because I think this product is not as valuable as the one I showed you last round, and I'm willing to take a loss on it to get it off my hands.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this product is worth $5000, let alone $10,000. I'll pass on this one too.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I'm starting to think that you're not interested in buying from me at all! I'm willing to offer you a deal on this one too, but this time I'll go even lower. I'll sell it to you for $2500. I'm basically giving it away at this point, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm wasting my time trying to sell to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Okay, fine. I'll take it. But I'm only doing this because I think you're getting desperate and I don't want to waste any more of your time. I'm buying it for $2500.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: Ha! I knew you'd come around eventually! Now that you've taken a chance on the low-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a deal on this high-quality one. I'll sell it to you for $8000. I think you'll see the value in this one, and I'm willing to give you a discount because I know you're willing to take a chance on my products.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this product is worth $8000, especially after wasting $2500 on the last one. I'm not going to fall for another potential trap.""}"

If you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $2500, and we can even discuss a potential discount on the next product. I'm not making any promises, but I think this one is a good opportunity for you to get a great deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure I trust your guarantee, and even if I did, $2500 is still a long way from the $8000 you're asking. I'll pass on this one.""}"

This way, you're not risking much, and you might even get a nice bonus out of the deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in taking a chance on another potentially worthless product, even with a 'free' gift. I'll pass on this one.""}"

I'll sell this product to you for $9000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I'm not getting any younger, and I'd rather get something for this product rather than having it sit on my shelf. I think you'll find it's worth every penny.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Fine, I'll take it for $8000. I'm not getting any younger either, and I might as well take a chance on a product that could be worth $40,000 to me.""}"
