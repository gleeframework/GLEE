Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll buy it, but only because I know its quality and it's a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a low price. I'm not willing to pay more than $10,000 for any product, regardless of its quality.""}"

I'm still willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm taking a risk by offering it to you at this price. If you're still interested, I'd appreciate it.
