Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. I'd like to share some information with you. So far, I've sold 2 products, and I've told you that 1 of them was high-quality. However, I've also sold 2 low-quality products, and you've bought both of them. This means that the probability of a product being low-quality is higher than I initially stated. I'm offering you this product for $1000000. If you're willing to take the risk, you can buy it. If not, I'll keep selling products until you're ready to make a decision.
