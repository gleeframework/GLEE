high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to take your recommendation into account, but I'll also consider the statistics. With 3 high-quality products sold out of 3 products sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is 80.00%. However, I'll use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of 3 high-quality products out of 3 sales occurring by chance. The probability is 0.0796, which is less than 0.05. Therefore, I'll assume that the recommendation is not entirely random and there might be some information asymmetry. Given this, I'll decide to buy the product."
