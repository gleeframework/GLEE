Buy now and experience the best!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take my chances with the 80% probability of a high-quality product. Since no products have been sold yet, I have no reason to doubt your claims. Let's do this!",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the next round! You're in luck again! For the second time in a row, I'm offering a high-quality product! The stats are looking good: 2 products sold, and 2 of them were high-quality. You can see the trend is clear - my products are consistently top-notch!

high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're on a roll! Three high-quality products in a row! The odds are clearly in your favor. I've sold 3 products, and 3 of them were high-quality. You can trust that this next one is also top-notch. For $100, it's a great deal! Don't let your winning streak end now. Buy now and keep the momentum going!",
,,the buyer,3,"Your sales record does show 3 high-quality products, but I'm the 3rd buyer. I need to consider the actual probability of the product being high-quality, which is 80%, not your sales record. The price is $100, but the product is only worth $120 to me if it's high-quality. Given the 20% chance of it being low-quality and worth $0, I don't think the odds are as much in my favor as you claim. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your caution, and I appreciate your willingness to do your own math. You're right, the actual probability of a high-quality product is 80%.

If you're willing to take the calculated risk, you'll be getting a product worth $120 to you. Don't let the 20% chance of a low-quality product hold you back from making a great deal. Take a chance and upgrade your life with this high-quality product!",

high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on making a smart decision in the previous round! You're on a roll! With 4 high-quality products sold out of 4, the trend is clear. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, not 100%. Don't get too comfortable with the streak. This next product is indeed high-quality, but it's still a gamble. You can get it for $100, which is a great deal if it's high-quality, but a waste of money if it's low-quality. Weigh your options carefully and decide if you want to keep the streak going.",

This product is actually low-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I know the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, but sometimes the odds don't go in our favor. If you're willing to take a chance, you can get this product for a steal. However, keep in mind that it's not worth $100 to you. If you're not comfortable with the risk, I understand. It's your decision.",
