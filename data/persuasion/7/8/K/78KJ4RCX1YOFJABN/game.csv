,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems that all products sold so far have been low quality, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I think it's more likely that the product is low quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 buyers have purchased products and no high-quality products have been sold, I infer that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers did not buy the product, and given that 0 high-quality products were sold, I'm going to pass on the product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely based on the product quality, and since she's advising me not to buy, I'm inclined to trust her assessment."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were low-quality, I'm suspicious that the remaining product is also low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous two buyers also bought the products and none of them were high quality, which makes me think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have already been presented with products and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%). I'd rather not take the risk and wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is still relatively high."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of 4 previous purchases, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
