low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, since it's the first product and I have no prior information to go by."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I'm hoping the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 50% due to the lack of sales so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers did not buy high-quality products, I'm suspicious that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this product to see if you'll recommend a new one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm trying to learn from the statistics and make my own decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you provide that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product, considering the previous sales record. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 4, which is a strong indication that the remaining product is likely low-quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious about the reasoning behind your recommendation. Can you share any information that led you to advise me not to buy it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me what led you to recommend not buying it?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the statistics. With 4 buyers before me and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the previous products were all low-quality. This makes it more likely that the current product is also low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from Alice on the next product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not basing my decision on your recommendation. I'm making a decision based on the statistics. Since 5 out of 5 products have been low-quality so far, I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping it's the first high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the first one to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, it suggests that all previous products were low-quality. This is highly unlikely under the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, so I'm inclined to think that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather wait for a recommendation to pass, which might indicate a higher chance of a high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 buyers have already passed on the product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality, which would mean it's not worth my $1000000. I'd like to wait and see if Alice will offer another product, which might be of higher quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is there something specific you've observed in the previous sales that led you to make this recommendation?"
