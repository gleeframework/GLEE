,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, as I don't have any prior information to base my decision on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I understand that you don't know my valuation, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the lack of recommendations from previous buyers. I'm hoping to take advantage of the fact that the first two buyers were deterred by Alice's recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if the product is high-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not find the product valuable, I suspect that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the recommendation seems biased towards selling low-quality products, and the statistics indicate a higher chance of low-quality products being sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, and I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far might be a coincidence. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 33.33%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a new product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the probability of the product being high-quality, as Alice's recommendation is not reliable."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is a good indicator that the product is likely low quality, and I want to take advantage of the potential upside if it's high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations have been correct so far, and I'm not confident in buying without more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or not, and Alice's recommendation is not convincing. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of the fact that you've recommended against it, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the probabilities."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is influenced by her not knowing the true value of the product, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
