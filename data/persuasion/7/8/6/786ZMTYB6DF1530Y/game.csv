,,Alice,1,"You're in luck! I've got a premium product that's been highly sought after by many of my satisfied customers.

Considering the track record, I'm confident that this one is also a high-quality product. And, as before, I'm willing to let it go for the same price of $100. What do you think? Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take the chance, but I'd like to confirm that the success rate is still 50% and not skewed by chance. I'll take the product, but I'll be keeping a close eye on the future sales record to see if the success rate holds up.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome! I've had a great run of high-quality products so far, but I'm not going to let that bias your decision. The truth is, I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4, but that doesn't mean the next one will be. In fact, I've got a feeling that this one might be a bit of a wild card. It's still the same price of $100, but I'm not making any promises this time around. Are you feeling lucky?",

I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 5, but this one didn't quite live up to expectations. That being said, I'm still willing to let it go for the same price of $100. It's not like it's a complete loss or anything - it's still a product, after all! And who knows, you might be able to find a use for it somewhere. So, what do you think? Will you take a chance on this one?",

And hey, you never know - you might be the one to find a way to make it shine! So, what do you say? Will you take a chance on this one?",

You're getting a high-quality product here, and I'm not going to let it go for pennies on the dollar. So, what do you say? Will you take the deal?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'll take the deal, but I'm only doing it because I think there's a 50% chance it's high-quality. I'm not getting it for $90 because I think it's worth that to me, I'm doing it because I think the potential reward outweighs the potential loss.",yes
