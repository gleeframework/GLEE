This is a tricky one! 

* **Alice's track record:** She has been consistently accurate in identifying low-quality products for the past 9 rounds.  This leads us to believe she might be able to accurately identify a high-quality product.

* **Risk vs. Reward:** If we buy the product and it's high-quality, we make a significant profit. If it's low-quality, we lose $10,000. 

Given the potential for a large profit, we are willing to take a calculated risk and trust Alice's recommendation. It's a gamble, but the potential reward outweighs the risk in this instance."
