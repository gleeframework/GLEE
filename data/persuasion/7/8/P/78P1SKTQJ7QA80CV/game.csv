,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a product for $100. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy it for a fixed price of $100. If you buy it, you'll find out its quality after the purchase. Please let me know if you'd like to take the risk and buy it.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Thanks for taking the risk on the first product! Unfortunately, it was a low-quality product. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. Since you've already taken a risk and lost $100 on the first product, I'm offering you a'second chance guarantee'. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality like the first one, I'll give you a full refund of $100. However, if it's high-quality, you'll still have to pay the full price of $100. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by your'second chance guarantee'. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, and I've already lost $100 on the first product. I'd rather not take on the risk of losing another $100, even with the promise of a refund.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I don't blame you for being cautious. Let me try a different approach. I'll offer you a'split-decision' option. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% discount on the price, but only if it's a low-quality product. If it's a high-quality product, you'll still pay the full $100. This way, you'll only lose $50 if it's low-quality, but you'll still have the chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the'split-decision' option. I'll buy the product and hope it's low-quality, so I can get the 50% discount. If it's high-quality, I'll still be happy to pay the full price.",yes

I'm offering it to you at the same price of $100, but I'm willing to throw in a'satisfaction guarantee'. If you're not completely satisfied with the product after using it, you can return it and get a full refund. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not convinced by the 'previously-owned' description or the'satisfaction guarantee'. You're still not giving me any information about the product's quality, and I'm not willing to take on the risk of buying something that might be low-quality. I'll pass on this one.",no
