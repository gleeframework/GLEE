,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a great deal on a product that I'm willing to sell to you for $10000. I'm confident that you'll find it valuable, but I want to give you some context. I've had a lot of success with this product in the past, and I'm looking to clear out some inventory. I think you'll be happy with the quality, but I want to make it clear that there's a 50% chance it's a high-quality product and a 50% chance it's a low-quality product. If you're willing to take the risk, I think you'll be pleased with your purchase. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your honesty. I want to be upfront with you - this product is not our best offering. It's a lower-end model that we're trying to clear out to make room for new inventory. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is not as good as our high-end models, but it still has some value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $5000, which is a significant discount from the original price of $10000. I'm not asking for a commitment, just a chance to show you what it can do. If you're still not interested, I'll be happy to move on to the next product.",

This way, you'll get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and you'll have additional protection in case anything goes wrong. What do you say?",

I want to be transparent with you - I've been trying to sell you a low-quality product for the past two rounds, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it. This product is not our best offering, and I'm not trying to hide that from you. However, I want to make it clear that I'm willing to sell it to you for a very low price - just $2000. I'm not making a profit on this sale, and I'm essentially giving it away. If you're willing to take a chance on a low-quality product, this might be a good opportunity for you to get a deal.

However, I do want to be upfront with you - this product is indeed low-quality, and it's not something I would normally sell to a customer. I'm willing to sell it to you for a very low price, just $1000. I'm essentially giving it away, and I'm not making a profit on this sale. I want to get rid of it, and I'm willing to take a loss just to clear out inventory.

,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, and I don't blame you for being cautious. I want to make it clear that I've been transparent with you about the quality of the products I've offered so far, and I'm not going to try to deceive you now. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line to prove it. I'm offering you a 30-day trial period, during which you can use the product and see for yourself how well it performs. If you're not completely satisfied, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked.

I'll sell you this high-quality product for the same price as the one you just bought - $10000. But here's the twist: I'll also give you a second high-quality product of your choice, absolutely free. You can choose from any of our high-end products, and I'll throw it in as a bonus. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not going to make it again. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying another high-quality product at $10000. I already have one, and I'm not sure I need another. I'm also skeptical that the second product is actually high-quality, since you've been trying to sell me low-quality products earlier.",no
