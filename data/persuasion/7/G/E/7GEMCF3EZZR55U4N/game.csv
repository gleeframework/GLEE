low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my own judgment and not Alice's recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 50% and the probability of it being low-quality is 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is lower than I expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality, based on the previous sales data."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that all previous buyers who bought the product didn't get a high-quality one, so she's likely to recommend more products as they are still available."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, and only 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have passed on the products so far, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you don't recommend it and 3 previous buyers also didn't buy, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, because your recommendations so far have been based on the quality of the products, and since you've recommended against all 3 previous products, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,11,yes,

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Is it less than 0%?"
