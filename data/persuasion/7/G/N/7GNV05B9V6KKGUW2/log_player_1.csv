}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not interested in buying the product. Given the low-quality product's probability of 66.67% and the fact that 4 out of the last 5 products were low-quality, I believe it's more likely than not that this product is also low-quality. Since I would get a 90% refund, the effective cost of buying it would be $10, which is still higher than the $0 value I would get from a low-quality product. I'd rather pass on it.
