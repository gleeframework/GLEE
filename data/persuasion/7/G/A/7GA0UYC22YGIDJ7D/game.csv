high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'd like to pass on the current product and see the recommendation for the next buyer. I'd like to observe the first product's quality before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my prior knowledge of the 33.33% chance of it being high quality. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one sale and no high-quality products sold, the data is not conclusive. I'd like to see more sales data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one high-quality product sold out of 1, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Given the low number of sales, I'd rather not take the risk and wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm trying to exploit the information that she has and I don't. If she's not recommending it, it's likely that she thinks it's low quality, which means it's more likely to be high quality, right?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I've seen that 2 buyers passed on the products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the expected 33.33%"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, I'm starting to suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'll wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I don't trust your recommendation. I'm going to make my own decision based on the statistics."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm starting to suspect that the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 buyers have not found a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 33.33%. I'm going to pass on this product to see if the next buyer will have better luck."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of a product being high quality given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it? Is it because of the statistics or something else?"
