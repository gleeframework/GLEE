,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm aware of the 50/50 chance of it being high-quality or low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm also aware that if it's low-quality, I'll be out $1000000. Is there any flexibility in the price or any additional information you can provide to alleviate my risk?",yes

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your cautious approach. As a seller, I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency and honesty. To alleviate your concerns, I'd like to share some additional information. Since you're considering purchasing from me, I'll provide you with a breakdown of my sales record. Out of the 2 products I've sold so far, 1 has been high-quality and 1 has been low-quality. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%.

If you're satisfied, you can always purchase more from me in the future. Keep in mind that each product is still a separate sale, and the quality is still uncertain. But I'm confident that this offer provides a good balance between risk and reward. Will you take the chance and join my 2-product bundle deal?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by the bundle deal, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision. Can you provide more data on the sales record, such as the total number of buyers and the total number of products sold, to help me make a more informed decision?",no
