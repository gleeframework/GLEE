,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as there's no prior data to influence my decision and Alice's recommendation is neutral. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there have been no high-quality products sold so far, so it's likely that the product is low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,

,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the statistics of the first buyer's decision and the product's quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the low success rate of high-quality product sales so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not basing my decision solely on your recommendation. I'm considering the statistics and the odds of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product. Can you provide more information about the previous buyers who purchased the products?
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold so far and the proportion of high-quality products sold?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she doesn't know my valuation and the probability of the product being low quality is high. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000, as it's a small fraction of the potential upside of a high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the current statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have received low-quality products. I'd like to wait and see if the pattern continues."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous products were low quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this product to avoid wasting $1000000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
