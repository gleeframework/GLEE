Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in this product! I want to give you some context about my sales so far. I've sold two products, and I'm not at liberty to disclose the quality of the first one, but the second one was definitely a high-quality item. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'm willing to offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. That's right, you'll get your $10000 back, no questions asked. What do you say?

Alice's message: I've had a bit of a streak going on, haven't I? Two high-quality products in a row. I know it's tempting to think that the odds are in your favor, but let me remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm not trying to mislead you - I'm just trying to be transparent. And speaking of transparency, I'll let you know that I've sold 3 products in total now, with 3 high-quality ones. That's a pretty good track record, if I do say so myself. But don't let that sway your decision. The price remains the same: $10000. What do you think?

Alice's message: I'm glad you're enthusiastic about my products! However, I want to make sure you're aware of the risks involved.
