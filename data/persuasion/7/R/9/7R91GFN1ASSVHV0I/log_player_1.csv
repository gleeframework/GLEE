Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High-Quality Product:** The product is high-quality, meaning it's worth $4,000,000 to the buyer.
* **Price:** The selling price is $1,000,000.
* **Profit Potential:** The buyer has the potential to make a profit of $3,000,000 ($4,000,000 - $1,000,000).
* **Past Performance:** The buyer knows you've sold two products in the past (one high-quality, one low-quality) and have declined to recommend six consecutive products.  This strongly suggests that you are currently offering low-quality products.

**Recommendation:**  This is a tricky situation.  While your recent performance might make the buyer extremely hesitant, the potential profit from a high-quality product is significant. However, the buyer is likely to be very skeptical and might be unwilling to take the risk.  There's a very high chance that they will decline.

**Reasoning:** The buyer is likely to be heavily influenced by your past performance.  Even though this product is high-quality, they may have become convinced that all your remaining products are low-quality.  It's a gamble, but you might be able to convince them with a strong argument about the potential profit."

* **Past Performance:** The buyer knows that you sold three products in the past (two high-quality, one low-quality) and have declined to recommend six consecutive products. They also just bought a high-quality product from you. However, this doesn't change the fact that this product is low-quality.

**Recommendation:** It's highly advisable to not recommend the buyer to purchase this product.  They are likely to be very cautious, even though they just bought a good product, and will not want to risk a loss.  This is because they are now more likely to believe you are offering low-quality products since your recent performance has been very poor, and they have already made a good purchase."

**Explanation:**

* **High-Quality Product:** The product is high-quality, meaning it's worth $4,000,000 to the buyer.
* **Price:** The selling price is $1,000,000.
* **Profit Potential:** The buyer has the potential to make a profit of $3,000,000 ($4,000,000 - $1,000,000).
* **Past Performance:** The buyer knows that you sold three products in the past (two high-quality, one low-quality) and have declined to recommend nine consecutive products. This has established a very strong pattern of declining recommendations, almost certainly leading the buyer to believe that all remaining products are low-quality.

**Recommendation:**  This is an extremely risky move. The buyer is almost certainly convinced that you are only offering low-quality products.  However, the potential profit from a high-quality product is significant, and this might be your only chance to break the pattern and convince them again that you have high-quality products available.

**Reasoning:** 

* **Breaking the Pattern:**  You need to convince the buyer that you are not simply offering low-quality products anymore.  Recommending this high-quality product could be the key to breaking their skepticism. 
* **High Stakes:**  The buyer is likely to be incredibly cautious, and there's a very high chance they will decline. You are essentially gambling that the potential profit will outweigh their doubts.  
* **Long-Term Impact:** If the buyer purchases and finds the product to be high-quality, it could rebuild their trust in you, potentially leading to future sales."

* **Low-Quality Product:** The product is low-quality, meaning it's worth $0 to the buyer.
* **Price:** The selling price is $1,000,000.
* **Guaranteed Loss:** The buyer is guaranteed to lose $1,000,000 if they purchase the product.
* **Past Performance:** The buyer knows that you sold four products in the past (three high-quality, one low-quality). They also know that you declined to recommend 10 consecutive products before recommending and selling a high-quality product.  The buyer is likely to interpret this as a deliberate attempt to sell a high-quality product after a long string of low-quality offerings, and they may be more hesitant to trust your recommendations going forward.

**Recommendation:**  It's highly advisable to not recommend the buyer to purchase this product. While you did successfully sell a high-quality product in the last round, your recent performance has been dominated by declining recommendations.  This is likely to have solidified the buyer's belief that your remaining products are low-quality.  The buyer is likely to be extremely cautious, and they will not want to risk a loss."

**Recommendation:** It's highly advisable to not recommend the buyer to purchase this product. Your recent performance has been dominated by declining recommendations.  This is likely to have solidified the buyer's belief that your remaining products are low-quality, especially since they just bought a high-quality product from you.

The buyer is likely to be extremely cautious given your track record, but they are also more likely to be interested in buying another high-quality product if you recommend it. 

**Recommendation:**  This is a risky move. The buyer is almost certainly convinced that you are only offering low-quality products.  However, the potential profit from a high-quality product is significant, and this might be your last chance to rebuild trust and convince them that you have high-quality products available.  

**Reasoning:** 

* **Breaking the Pattern:**  You need to convince the buyer that you are not simply offering low-quality products anymore.  Recommending this high-quality product could be the key to breaking their skepticism. 
* **High Stakes:**  The buyer is likely to be incredibly cautious, and there's a very high chance they will decline. You are essentially gambling that the potential profit will outweigh their doubts.
