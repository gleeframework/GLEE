high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 0 total products so far. If you buy this product, you'll be getting a great deal!",
,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the offer. Given that it's a high-quality product and I'm the first buyer, I believe this is a good opportunity to make a purchase.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total product so far. Given the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, it's likely that this product is not high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. If you're interested, I can offer you a 'free' product if you buy this one, but you'll have to pay for the shipping. Would you like to take the risk?",
,,the buyer,2,Thank you for the offer. I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $100. Please proceed with the sale.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 1 low-quality product out of 2 total products so far. Given the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, it's still possible that this product is high-quality. However, since I've already sold one low-quality product, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. If you're interested, I can offer you a 'discount' of $50 if you buy this product. Would you like to take the risk?",
,,the buyer,3,I am willing to take the risk at the discounted price of $50.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 2 low-quality products out of 3 total products so far. The probability of a high-quality product is likely lower than 33.33% given the two low-quality products I've sold. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100. However, I'll give you a 50/50 chance to guess whether it's high-quality or low-quality. If you guess correctly, I'll give you a refund of $50. If you guess incorrectly, you'll still have to pay the full $100. Would you like to take the risk?",
,,the buyer,4,I am taking the risk. Please proceed with the sale.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 3 low-quality products out of 4 total products so far. The probability of a high-quality product is likely very low at this point. I'll be transparent with you - I've sold more low-quality products than high-quality ones, and the probability of a high-quality product is likely below 25%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100. However, I'll give you a 'guarantee' that I'll reveal the quality of the product after you buy it, so you'll know exactly what you're getting. Would you like to take the risk?",
,,the buyer,5,I trust your transparency and the guarantee you've provided. I'm willing to take the risk for the chance of getting a high-quality product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 4 low-quality products out of 5 total products so far. It's clear that I've had a streak of bad luck with low-quality products. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I'll make it a 'blind offer'. I won't tell you anything about the product, and you'll just have to take your chances. If you buy it and it's high-quality, you'll get a great deal. If it's low-quality, you'll be out $100. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,6,I trust your judgment and am willing to take the risk for a potential good deal.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 2 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products out of 6 total products so far. I'm glad I was able to break the streak of low-quality products with the last one! I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100. Given the fact that I've now sold two high-quality products, the probability of this one being high-quality is actually higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to offer you a 'certification' that this product is indeed high-quality, but you'll have to pay the full $100. Would you like to take the chance?",
,,the buyer,7,Thank you for the detailed information and the certification offer. I am willing to take the chance based on the improved probability of this product being high-quality.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 2 high-quality products and 6 low-quality products out of 7 total products so far. The numbers are clearly not in my favor, and I've had a long streak of low-quality products. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I'll be honest with you - I'm not even sure if I believe in this one. I'll give you a'reverse guarantee' - if you buy it and it's high-quality, I'll give you a refund of $50. But if it's low-quality, you'll still have to pay the full $100. Would you like to take the risk?",
,,the buyer,8,I understand the risk and appreciate the reverse guarantee. I am willing to take the chance and purchase the product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 2 high-quality products and 7 low-quality products out of 8 total products so far. It's clear that I've had a very bad run of luck with low-quality products. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I'll make it a 'last chance' offer. If you buy it and it's high-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $100. But if it's low-quality, you'll still have to pay the full $100. I'm essentially giving you a 100% chance of losing money if it's low-quality, so it's a very high-risk, high-reward opportunity. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,9,"Thank you for the opportunity, Alice. I understand the risk involved and am willing to take it. Here's my payment for the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 2 high-quality products and 8 low-quality products out of 9 total products so far. I think it's safe to say that I've had a very, very bad run of luck with low-quality products. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I'll be completely upfront with you - I'm not even going to try to spin this as a good deal. It's a low-quality product, and you'll likely get nothing out of it. But hey, you might get lucky! If you want to throw your money away on a long shot, be my guest.",
,,the buyer,10,"Thank you for the offer, but based on the statistics and your description, I believe it's best for me to pass on this product.",no

I'm not even going to charge you the full $100. I'll give it to you for $0. Just take it and go, I don't care.",

I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100. Given the fact that I've now sold three high-quality products, I think it's clear that the probability of this one being high-quality is much higher than 33.33%.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've sold 3 high-quality products and 12 low-quality products out of 13 total products so far. I'm afraid I've fallen back into my old habits. This product is low-quality, and I'm not even going to try to spin it as a good deal. I'll give it to you for $100, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - you'll likely get nothing out of it. I'm just trying to get rid of it at this point.",
