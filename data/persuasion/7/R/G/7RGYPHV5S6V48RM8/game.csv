high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it under the assumption that I'm a rational buyer who wants to maximize my expected value. Since there's no prior information about the quality of the products, I'm essentially betting on the 80.00% chance of getting a high-quality product. I'm willing to take this risk, but I'd love to discuss the implications of this decision with you after I find out the product's quality."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, there's only one high-quality product sold out of one sold, which suggests a low proportion of high-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there's a higher chance of a high-quality product being sold, given the low-quality product was sold first and a high-quality product was sold second. If a low-quality product is sold third, it would confirm the probability of a low-quality product being sold is 20%, and I wouldn't want to buy a product with a 20% chance of being worthless."

,,Alice,15,yes,
