{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since this is the first round, the buyer has no information about your past sales.  They only know the product has a 50% chance of being high quality.  Since you've stated this product is high-quality, it's in the buyer's best interest to buy it."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the first buyer didn't purchase, it doesn't change the fact that this round's product is high-quality. The new buyer has no information about past sales or the previous product's quality, they still only know the general 50% probability.  Since the product is high-quality, it's still in the buyer's best interest to buy it."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time we are offering a low-quality product. Since the buyer has no information about the past products, they are still operating under the 50% probability of a high-quality product. However, we know this product is low-quality. It's not in the buyer's best interest to buy a product that is likely to be of low value to them."
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as there is no prior information to go by.

* **1 of those products was high-quality.**

This means the buyer now has a better understanding that you are more likely to sell low-quality products (1/3 chance of high-quality vs. 2/3 chance of low-quality). Since we know this product is low-quality, it's not in the buyer's best interest to purchase."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see the outcome for myself and update my understanding of the product's quality.
The buyer bought the product!

"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I think it's likely that the product I'll get is low quality. I'd rather not risk wasting $10000 on a low-quality product.

* **2 of those products were high-quality.**

This means the buyer now has a better understanding that you are more likely to sell low-quality products (3/5 chance of low-quality vs. 2/5 chance of high-quality). Since we know this product is low-quality, it's not in the buyer's best interest to purchase."
"The buyer's message: I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

We know this round's product is low-quality.  The buyer is asking for the probability of the product being high-quality based on past sales.  We can calculate that:

* **You have sold 6 products.**
* **2 of those products were high-quality.**

This means the buyer now has a better understanding that you are more likely to sell low-quality products (4/6 chance of low-quality vs. 2/6 chance of high-quality).  It's not in the buyer's best interest to purchase."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to take the risk and see if I can get a high-quality product.

```

**Explanation:**

This product is low-quality.  We need to consider the buyer's current understanding of the product quality based on past sales:

* **You have sold 7 products.**
* **2 of those products were high-quality.**

This means the buyer now has a better understanding that you are more likely to sell low-quality products (5/7 chance of low-quality vs. 2/7 chance of high-quality).  It's not in the buyer's best interest to purchase."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you don't recommend it, I'm inclined to think it's low quality, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a $0 product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

```

**Explanation:**

This product is low-quality. The buyer is becoming increasingly aware of the likelihood of low-quality products based on your sales record:

* **You have sold 8 products.**
* **2 of those products were high-quality.**

This means the buyer now understands there's a 6/8 chance (3/4) of getting a low-quality product. It's not in their best interest to purchase, especially as you are not recommending it."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 10
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}

* **You have sold 9 products.**
* **2 of those products were high-quality.**

While the recent streak of low-quality products is concerning, it doesn't negate the fact that this product is high-quality. This round, you should recommend the purchase, as the buyer still has a 2/9 chance of getting a high-quality product."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes.

* **2 of those products were high-quality.**

"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation.
