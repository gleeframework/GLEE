Alice's message: You're aware that the seller has a high success rate of selling high-quality products. In the previous round, a high-quality product was sold at the same price of $10000. This suggests that the seller is being transparent and honest about the product's quality. Given the seller's track record, it's likely that this product is also high-quality. Consider the potential value of this product, which is worth $12000 to you. Is the risk of it being low-quality really worth passing up the opportunity to acquire a valuable item at a discounted price?

Alice's message: You've seen two consecutive high-quality products sold at the same price of $10000. This is a strong indication that the seller is selling high-quality products at a discounted price. It's worth noting that the probability of two high-quality products being sold in a row is 0.64 (80% * 80%). This is higher than the expected probability of 0.64 if the seller was randomly selling high-quality products. This suggests that the seller may be intentionally selling high-quality products at this price. Consider the potential value of this product and the seller's track record before making a decision.

Alice's message: You've seen three consecutive high-quality products sold at $10000, which is a significant deviation from the expected probability. This suggests that the seller may be intentionally selling high-quality products at this price. However, it's also possible that the seller is simply lucky. To mitigate this risk, I'd like to offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll sell you another high-quality product at the same price.

I'll be honest with you, I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely if I was randomly selling high-quality products.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective. If I was intentionally selling low-quality products, I would have been caught by now, and my reputation would be ruined. Instead, I've been transparent about my sales record, and you've seen the evidence for yourself. The fact that I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, followed by 2 low-quality products, suggests that I'm not consistently selling low-quality products.
