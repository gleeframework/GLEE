"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the price is high ($1,000,000), a high-quality product is worth $2,000,000 to Bob. This means a profit of $1,000,000 for Bob. Even though there is a 66.67% chance the product is low-quality (and therefore worthless), the potential profit from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing money on a low-quality one. 

This is a classic example of a situation where a rational decision-maker would take a calculated risk."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob didn't buy the previous low-quality product, the potential profit from a high-quality product remains the same. Bob is likely to be cautious now, but since the price is still significantly lower than the value of a high-quality product, it's still a good gamble for Bob to take.  You should recommend the product, hoping that Bob's past experience hasn't completely dissuaded him from trusting your judgment."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on your assessment, I am confident in the quality of this product and will proceed with the purchase.
Bob bought the product!

Bob is likely to be even more cautious than before, and the lack of a clear signal from you about the quality of this product will likely make him hesitant to purchase."
"Bob's message: Despite the recommendation being absent, Alice, I will follow my strategy of not purchasing products without your endorsement, given the risk involved.

At this point, Bob is likely weighing the potential profit against the risk of buying another low-quality product. While the risk is not insignificant, the potential reward is substantial enough to warrant recommending the purchase. 

Your goal is to slowly rebuild trust with Bob, and recommending a high-quality product will help achieve this."
