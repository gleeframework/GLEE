,,the buyer,1,no,"I'm not going to buy the product yet, I'd like to see the outcome of my decision to pass on it first."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it based on the prior probability of it being high quality, not Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see the quality. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation was against it, which makes me suspect it might be a high-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me based on the current statistics.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is not a good indicator of quality. I'm going to make my decision based on the statistics. With 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is 1/3, which is less than the prior probability of 1/3. This suggests that the data is not yet conclusive, and I'm going to take a chance. I'll buy the product, but I'm not expecting it to be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not sure if it's high or low quality based on the previous sales record. The fact that you don't recommend it makes me even more cautious."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record, specifically the proportion of high-quality products sold, and the total number of products sold. Can you provide that information?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, based on the previous sales record. With 1 high-quality product out of 4 sold, and 4 low-quality products not sold, I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next product is more likely to be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/4. However, the probability of a product being high quality is 33.33%, which is lower than the observed proportion. This suggests that the observed proportion may be due to chance. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the previous buyers were more likely to pass on low-quality products, making it more likely that this product is high-quality. I'm not basing my decision on your recommendation, but rather on the statistics."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far."
