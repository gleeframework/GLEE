Alice's message: This is the first product I'm offering. I'm not sure what it's worth to you, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. You can buy it now and see what you think of it, or you can wait and see if the next product is better. Keep in mind that I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, which is below the expected 50%.

Alice's message: Welcome to the second product! I've sold 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. This might seem like a continuation of the trend, but it's also possible that the first product was an anomaly. Since you don't know the quality of the previous product, you can't infer much from the statistics. However, I'll give you some context: the first buyer was willing to take a chance on a low-quality product at the full price of $10000. If you're feeling lucky, you can buy this product now and see what you think of it. If you're not feeling lucky, you can wait and see if the next product is more appealing.

Alice's message: Welcome to the third product! I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row, which is a bit concerning. This might be a sign that my selection is skewed towards low-quality products. However, it's also possible that I'm just having a bad streak. I want to be transparent with you: I've sold 2 products, and both were low-quality. I'm willing to offer you a deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 5% discount, bringing the price down to $9500.

Alice's message: Welcome to the fourth product! I'm glad you're considering this one. As you may have noticed, my sales record so far has been a bit rocky, with two low-quality products in a row. However, I want to assure you that I have a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product, just like this one.
