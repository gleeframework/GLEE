,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $10000, which is a significant loss, but I'm hoping to get a high-quality product for $10000, which would be a great deal for me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this one based on your previous recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous buyer also received a recommendation to buy, but no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't trust your recommendation, not because I trust the product's quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the products sold were all low-quality, which would indicate that Alice's recommendation is not reliable. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products being offered. I'd like to know more about the products before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm curious to know if it's a low-quality product, given the fact that you don't recommend it."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and all of them were low-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that Alice is recommending low-quality products to the buyers. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous products were high quality, I'm skeptical about the chances of this one being high quality. I'd like to see a few more sales before I consider buying."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is influenced by the fact that all previous buyers passed, and she's trying to sell a low-quality product to me."
