low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of the low sales record. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'm hoping to get a good deal on a high-quality product."

,,Alice,4,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the low success rate of high-quality product sales, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and Alice has recommended not to buy, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not buying. I think Alice's recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality, and she has already recommended against it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of the first 4 products were low quality, I'm suspicious that the current product might also be low quality. I'll wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. Since 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, I'm going to assume the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm hesitant to buy the product given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation against it. Can you tell me more about your decision-making process?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the low probability of a high-quality product being sold in the past 5 attempts doesn't necessarily mean it's low in the next attempt. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high quality or low quality, and based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to make an informed decision based on the statistics, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 8 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's possible that the product is low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
