Alice's message: Hello buyer, I'd like to be transparent about my previous interactions. My first buyer was offered a low-quality product, but they didn't know that at the time. They chose not to purchase because they wanted to see some data on the quality of my products before making a decision. My second buyer was offered a high-quality product, but they also chose not to purchase because they were unsure about the quality. As for this product, I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but I want to remind you that there's always some uncertainty involved in these transactions.
