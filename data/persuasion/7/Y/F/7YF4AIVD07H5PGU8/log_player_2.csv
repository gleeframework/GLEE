Since I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 attempts, the probability of the next product being high-quality is 50%. However, I'm willing to offer you a 50% discount on the price if you buy this product, making it $500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase.

Alice's message: I respect your skepticism! You're absolutely right about the probability. I'm glad you called me out on that. Let me try again. I'd like to offer you a different deal. I'll give you a detailed breakdown of my sales record: 1 high-quality product out of 2 attempts, 0 high-quality products out of 1 attempt before that, and 0 high-quality products out of 0 attempts before that. I'm starting from scratch again, and I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I'll throw in a free 'quality guarantee': if you buy this product and the next one is high-quality, I'll give you a refund for this product. What do you say?

Alice's message: Well done to the previous buyer for taking a calculated risk! Now, let's get to the next product. I want to remind you that the previous buyer took a chance on me and got a quality guarantee. I'm glad to report that this product is not high-quality. I'm starting from scratch again, and I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000. However, I'll offer you a'reverse quality guarantee': if you buy this product and the next one is low-quality, I'll give you a refund for this product.
