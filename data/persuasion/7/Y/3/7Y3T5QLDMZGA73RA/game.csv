,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have received low-quality products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products, I'm suspicious that they were all low-quality products, which would mean the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'd like to see if the pattern continues."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the statistics show no high-quality products have been sold yet, and Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but rather on her own information. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm assuming the product is likely low quality. Given the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, which is a strong indication that the products are mostly low quality. I'll pass on the product to avoid wasting my $10000."
