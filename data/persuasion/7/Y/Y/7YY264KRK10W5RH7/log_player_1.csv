  ""message"": ""I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go below the original price of $10,000. I can offer you a slight concession, though: if you buy this product, I'll throw in a free accessory that complements it perfectly.

}"

}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not convinced that a certificate of authenticity and a 5-year warranty are enough to justify the full price of $10000. I'd like to reiterate that the product has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality, and I'm not willing to take that risk at any price. I'd like to pass on this offer and wait for the next product.

}"

}"
