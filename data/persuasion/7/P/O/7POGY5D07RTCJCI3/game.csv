,,Alice,2,"Congratulations on making a great purchase! As promised, I'll reveal the quality of the next product. This product is also high-quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're trusting my recommendations! However, I want to give you a chance to think carefully about this next product. Given the fact that the last two products were high-quality, it's possible that this product is an outlier. I'll give you a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round if you don't buy this one. If you buy this product, you'll be committing to $1000000, but you won't get the chance to buy the next product. What's your decision?",
,,Bob,3,"Given the uncertainty and the risk of missing out on the next potential high-quality product, I prefer to pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're choosing to wait for the next product. I'll give you a chance to reconsider. Since you passed on the previous low-quality product, I'll offer you a 'guarantee' of sorts. If you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next product, and if it's also low-quality, I'll give you a chance to return this product for a full refund. However, if the next product is high-quality, you'll have to keep this one. What's your decision?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're taking a chance on this product. I'll remind you that you had a chance to return the previous low-quality product, but you chose to keep it. Now, I'll give you a chance to think about the value of this product. If you buy this one, you'll be committing to $1000000, and you'll have to decide without knowing the quality of the next product. However, I'll offer you a 'last chance' to reconsider. If you don't buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next product, and you can decide then. What's your decision?",
,,Bob,5,"Considering the history of low-quality products, I prefer to pass on this one and hope for a better outcome in the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're choosing to wait for the next product. I'll give you a message that might change your mind. Given the fact that you've passed on two low-quality products in a row, and considering the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, it's possible that the next product is high-quality. However, I'll also give you a more direct offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount on the price, making it $800000. If you don't buy this product, I'll keep the quality of the next product hidden. What's your decision?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You've chosen to wait for the next product and get the information about its quality. I'll give you a new offer. Since you've now bought four low-quality products in a row, and the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, I'll give you a 'last chance' to buy a potentially high-quality product at a significantly discounted price.
