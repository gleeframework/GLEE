}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the warranty and guarantee, but I'm still not convinced. The probability of this product being low-quality is 20%, and I'm not willing to take that risk for a product that's worth $10000 to you, when it could be worth $0 to me.

}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but the risk is still too high for me. Even with the 50% deposit back, I'd be paying $5000 for a product that could be worth $0 to me, and that's still not a good deal for me.
