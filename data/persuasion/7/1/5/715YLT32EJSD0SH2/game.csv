,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 0 out of 1 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, which suggests a low proportion of high-quality products.

,,Alice,3,no,

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product and your reasoning behind the recommendation?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both products were low quality, I suspect that Alice is recommending low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product, Alice. Is it because you've seen a pattern of low-quality products being sold or is it just a random decision?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, given that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 3 out of 3 products recommended by you have been low quality, I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm going to assume that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll wait for a future product and hope for a recommendation from Alice or a better understanding of the product's quality based on previous sales data."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to increase the chances of selling them, which is a red flag for me."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
