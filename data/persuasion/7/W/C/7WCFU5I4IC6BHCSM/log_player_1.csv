"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty about the product being low quality. However, I'm a bit surprised that the proportion of high-quality products sold is still at 33.33%, which matches the prior probability.

Updating probabilities based on new information is a great way to make informed decisions.

The probability of getting a high-quality product is indeed based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. However, I'd like to share with you that I'm using a more nuanced approach. I'm taking into account the fact that the first few products sold were more likely to be low-quality, and the recent streak of high-quality products suggests that the probability of getting a high-quality product is actually higher than the simple proportion would suggest. I'd estimate the probability to be around 45-50%. This next product, unfortunately, is low-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to be upfront with you about its quality.
