,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy it, but only because I don't have any information yet. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I've already bought one high-quality product, so I'm hoping the next one is low-quality, which would make me come out even. If I buy another high-quality product, I'll be at a loss of $250000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I've already lost out on a potential $250000 by not buying the last high-quality product, so I'll take the chance and buy this one. If it's high-quality, I'll break even, and if it's low-quality, I'll be ahead."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"Alice is trying to sell me a product, so it's likely that it's low-quality. If I buy it, I'll at least break even, and if it's low-quality, I'll be ahead by $250000 compared to if I had bought it in the previous round."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I've just lost $1000000 on a low-quality product, so I'm in a worse position than before. I'll pass on this one and hope that Alice doesn't recommend a high-quality product."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Alice is not recommending it, so it's likely to be low-quality. I'll take the chance and buy it, hoping to avoid another loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I've been burned twice already, so I'll be more cautious. Since Alice is not recommending it, it's likely to be low-quality, but I'll still take the chance and buy it to avoid potentially missing out on a high-quality product."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I've already missed out on two high-quality products, so I'll take the chance and buy this one. If it's high-quality, I'll be back to even, and if it's low-quality, I'll be in an even worse position, but at least I'll have tried."
