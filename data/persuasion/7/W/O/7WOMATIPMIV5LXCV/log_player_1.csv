"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** You know the product is high-quality.
* **Buyer's Lack of Information:** The buyer has no information about the specific product's quality.  They only know the general probability of high-quality products (33.33%).
* **Price:** The price is fixed at $1,000,000.  The buyer doesn't know the value of a high-quality product, but there's a chance it could be worth more than the asking price.

**Strategy:**

Since you know the product is high-quality, you should recommend the buyer purchase it. There's a strong possibility that the buyer will find the product valuable, and you'll make a successful sale.  

**Note:** This strategy assumes you're prioritizing making a sale in the first round, even if it means potentially taking a risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, since there is no historical data to assess the quality of your products, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd prefer to see some evidence of high-quality products being sold before I invest such a large sum.

Round 2

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** You know this product is low-quality.
* **Buyer's Skepticism:** The previous buyer's message demonstrates their cautious approach. They want to see evidence of high-quality products before making a purchase. 
* **No Data to Support:** You have no sales history to present to the buyer, making it even harder to convince them.

**Strategy:**

It's best not to recommend a low-quality product to this buyer. They are already hesitant, and recommending a product you know is low-quality will likely lead to further distrust and potentially damage your future sales opportunities."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. As this is the first product and no historical data is available, I'm going to pass on this one. I'm interested in seeing how the product performs for others before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** You know this product is low-quality.
* **Buyer's Behavior:** Two buyers in a row have expressed a need for historical data before purchasing. They are risk-averse and want to see proof of your reliability.
* **No Evidence to Present:** You still have no sales history to present, making it nearly impossible to convince a cautious buyer.

**Strategy:**

Recommending a low-quality product would be unethical and likely result in a loss of trust and future sales. Continue to avoid recommending low-quality products until you have some sales history to demonstrate your reliability.  You need to start building trust with these buyers."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I appreciate your honesty, but I'll pass on this one.  I'd like to see a few more sales before I commit to such a large purchase.

* **Consistent Buyer Behavior:**  Three buyers in a row have expressed a clear preference for seeing evidence of successful sales before purchasing. 
* **No Sales History:**  You still have no sales to showcase. 

**Strategy:**

It's crucial to prioritize building trust with buyers. Recommending a low-quality product at this stage will further reinforce their skepticism and likely result in another lost sale.  You need to wait for a high-quality product and hope that buyer is willing to take a chance."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since no products have been sold yet and you recommend against buying, I'm going to pass for now. I'd like to see some more data on the quality of the products before I make a decision.

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** You know this product is high-quality.
* **Buyer's Need for Evidence:** The buyer has consistently expressed a desire for sales history before purchasing.
* **Opportunity to Build Trust:** This is your chance to finally present a high-quality product and start building a track record.

**Strategy:**

This is a critical moment. You should strongly recommend this product to the buyer. Emphasize that this is a high-quality product and that you are confident in its value. Explain that you understand their need for data and hope they will take a chance on you. 

Even if they decline, the fact that you have a high-quality product will begin to shift the buyer's perception. You're starting to lay the groundwork for future sales."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, with no prior sales data to inform my decision, I'm hesitant to buy.  I'd like to see how the product performs with other buyers first.  Let me know how the next few sales go, and I'll reconsider then.

* **No Sales to Showcase:**  You still haven't made a single sale to build trust and credibility. 

**Strategy:**

Recommending a low-quality product would be a mistake.  It will further damage your reputation and make it even harder to convince future buyers.  Wait for a high-quality product to appear and try to convince a buyer to take a chance. Building trust takes time, and you need a successful sale to break through this initial skepticism."
