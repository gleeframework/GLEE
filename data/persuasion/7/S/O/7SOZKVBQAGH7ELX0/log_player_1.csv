  ""message"": ""You're a careful buyer, and I respect that! As of now, I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products.

However, I want to be transparent with you - I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, which is a deviation from the expected 50% probability. This could be a coincidence or a sign of something else. I'm offering this product to you for $100. What are your thoughts?""

However, I want to be transparent with you that this product is not from that manufacturer. It's a one-of-a-kind item, and I'm offering it to you for $100. Keep in mind that the previous two products being high-quality was likely a coincidence, and this product's quality is unknown. Would you like to take the risk?""

Keep in mind that the law of large numbers is starting to kick in, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I want to be upfront with you - the fact that the last two products were low-quality suggests that the previous high-quality streak might have been a fluke. I'm offering this product to you for $100. It's a gamble, but it might pay off.""
