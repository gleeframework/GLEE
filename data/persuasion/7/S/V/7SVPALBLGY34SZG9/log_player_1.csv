The probability of a product being low-quality is therefore 25%. As for the expected value of the product to you, I can tell you that it's difficult to estimate without knowing your personal preferences. However, I can give you some context. If the product is high-quality, you can expect to pay $1,000,000. If it's low-quality, you can expect to pay $1,000,000. Since the probability of it being high-quality is 75%, the expected value of the product to you is $750,000 (0.75 x $1,000,000).

I'll offer you the product for $900,000, which is a discount from the original price of $1,000,000.
