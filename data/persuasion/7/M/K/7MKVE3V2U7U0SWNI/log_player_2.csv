**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one previous buyer's data. This isn't enough to draw statistically significant conclusions about Alice's recommendation accuracy.
* **High Potential Reward:**  A high-quality product is worth $20,000, significantly more than the $10,000 price. 
* **Alice's Incentive:**  Alice likely has a strong incentive to recommend products that she knows are high-quality to maximize her sales and maintain a positive reputation.

**Overall:**  The risk of purchasing a low-quality product is outweighed by the potential for a large profit from a high-quality one."
