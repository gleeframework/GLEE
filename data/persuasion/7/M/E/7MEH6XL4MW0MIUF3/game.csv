As a valued customer, I want to assure you that the odds of getting a high-quality product are still the same as for the first customer, which is 33.33%. Don't let the previous customer's decision influence your decision. This is a new, independent product with a 33.33% chance of being worth $30000 to you. It's a risk worth taking, don't you think?",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Welcome to the third round! I'm glad you're interested in this product. As you've noticed, I've sold two products so far, and one of them was high-quality. This might seem like a good sign, but remember that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm not trying to influence your decision, but I do want to point out that you now have more information than the first two customers did. With this new information, you can make a more informed decision. Will you take the risk and buy this product for $10000?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, considering the new information that only 0 out of 2 products sold so far were high-quality, which is a relatively low proportion. I'll hope that the next product will be the one that breaks the streak.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've seen the trend so far: 0 out of 3 products sold were high-quality. Some might say this is a concerning sign. However, as I've mentioned before, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I want to remind you that you're not just making a decision based on the previous products, but also on the fact that I'm a seller who is trying to make sales. With this in mind, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to break the streak and get a high-quality product. Will you take the chance and buy this product for $10000?",
,,the buyer,4,"I understand your point, but I'm not convinced by the trend. I'd like to take a chance and break the streak. I'll take the product!",yes

,,Alice,5,"You're our fifth customer, and I'm glad you're interested in this product. I want to point out that the streak of low-quality products continues. Some might think this is a sign that the previous products were just a fluke, but others might think it's a pattern. As the seller, I want to assure you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. However, I also want to be transparent with you: I've sold 3 low-quality products in a row. It's up to you to decide whether to take the risk and buy this product for $10000.",

,,Alice,6,"Welcome to the sixth round! I'm glad you're interested in this product. As you've seen, the streak of low-quality products has been broken, and we've now had two high-quality products out of six sold. This might be a sign that the previous low-quality products were indeed just a fluke. With this in mind, I'd like to offer you a chance to take advantage of the fact that the odds of getting a high-quality product seem to be increasing. Will you take the risk and buy this product for $10000?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the increasing trend of high-quality products.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're our seventh customer, and I'm glad you're considering this product. I want to remind you that the odds of getting a high-quality product are still 33.33%, and the previous high-quality products were just a coincidence. The fact that the last two products were low-quality doesn't necessarily mean the next one will be too. I'm not trying to hide anything from you - I'm just a seller trying to make a sale. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll give you a chance to buy this product for $10000.",
,,the buyer,7,I'm not convinced that the previous high-quality products were just a coincidence. I'd like to know more about the seller's sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your diligence. As a seller, I'm happy to share more information with you. Out of the 7 products I've sold so far, 3 have been high-quality and 4 have been low-quality. This means that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 3/7 or approximately 42.86%. I want to reiterate that this is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future sales, but I'm willing to be transparent with you. With this in mind, will you take the risk and buy this product for $10000?",

This is a significant increase from the initial 33.33% probability, and it might be tempting to think that the odds are now in your favor. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and the previous high-quality products were just a sequence of independent events. Will you take the risk and buy this product for $10000?",
