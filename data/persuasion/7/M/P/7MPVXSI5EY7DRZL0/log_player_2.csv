Round 2
Alice's message: I'm offering you a product for $10000. I know what you're thinking, 'Alice, you just sold me a high-quality product, but this one is low-quality.' But think about it, I've already made a sale, so I have less incentive to try to sell you a low-quality product. Plus, I've got 18 more chances to sell you a high-quality product. You're still getting a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round if you buy this one. What do you say?

However, I want to remind you that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%, and I've got 17 more chances to sell you a low-quality product.

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited about the streak, but I've got to be honest with you, Bob. You've already gotten three high-quality products in a row, which is a bit suspicious. I'm starting to think that you might be getting a bit too lucky. I'm offering you a product for $10000, but I want to remind you that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%. I'm not trying to deceive you, but I want to make sure you're making an informed decision. What do you think?
