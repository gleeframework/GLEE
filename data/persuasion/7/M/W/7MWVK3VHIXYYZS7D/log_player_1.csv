``` 
 
Alice knows the product is high-quality and worth $4,000,000 to Bob. However, Bob has no information about the quality of the product and is risk-averse.  Since the price is fixed at $1,000,000, Bob is likely to lose money if he buys the product, as there's a high chance it's low-quality (66.67%).  Even though Alice knows the product is good, Bob doesn't have enough information to make a confident decision.  Therefore, it's not recommended to recommend Bob to buy the product."
