However, if you choose not to'steal' it, you'll still get the product at the regular price of $9000. This way, you'll have the option to take a chance and potentially save $1000, or play it safe and get the product at a guaranteed price. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the'steal' option. The 50% chance of getting the product at the original price of $10,000 is not enough to outweigh the risk of potentially losing the product entirely. I'd rather pay the guaranteed price of $9000.""}"
