,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're recommending it. Your previous recommendations were based on the product's quality, so I'm assuming you know whether it's high or low quality. If you're not recommending it, that means it's likely low quality, and I'd like to pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
