high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that the first buyer didn't buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a reason for your recommendation. I'm not sure why you don't recommend it, and I'd like to know the reasoning behind it."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have passed on the products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered might be lower than 50%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it and no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that the products being recommended might be low-quality. I'll wait for the next product to see if the recommendation changes."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products Alice has been offering. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none have purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the products sold so far were low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product, so I can get a better sense of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm hesitant to buy after seeing the previous recommendations, but I'd like to ask: what's the basis for your recommendation not to buy?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't trust your recommendation. I'm buying it to see if I can get a high-quality product, even though you're not recommending it."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this product.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 5 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation from Alice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being low quality is higher than the probability of it being high quality, and I'm hoping to be the one to reveal the low-quality product to Alice. I'm not relying on Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's lack of recommendation makes me think there's a higher chance it's a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get a better understanding of the product's quality and the probability of future high-quality products being sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
