As of now, I've sold 1 out of 2 products, which means that 50% of the products I've sold so far are high-quality. This information should give you a better idea of the chances of getting a high-quality product. With this in mind, I'm still confident that this product has a 50% chance of being high-quality.

As of now, I've sold 2 out of 4 products, which means that 50% of the products I've sold so far are high-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've noticed that the last product sold was a high-quality one. This might make you wonder if the next product is also high-quality. But, I assure you that each product is an independent event, and the probability of getting a high-quality product remains the same at 50%. The price remains the same at $10000. What do you think? Will you take the chance and buy this product?
