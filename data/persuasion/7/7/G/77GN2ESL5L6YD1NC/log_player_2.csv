**Explanation:**

* **The evidence:** Alice has a perfect track record. All 3 products she recommended were high quality.
* **The odds:** While each product has a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality, Alice's perfect record suggests she may have some insight or be able to discern the quality.
* **The value:** A high-quality product is worth $12,500, which is a significant gain. Even if it's low quality, I'm not out anything except the opportunity cost of waiting for a different product.

Therefore, based on the available information, it's a good gamble to buy the product."
