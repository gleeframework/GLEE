They were waiting for more data before making a decision. I'm glad to say that they're now regretful of not taking the chance, as they've since learned about the quality of my products. With 3 out of 4 products being high-quality, I'm even more confident in the quality of this one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, and I'm sure you'll be thrilled with your purchase. Take a chance and experience the quality for yourself!",

It's a more basic model that still offers good value, but it may not have all the features you're looking for. It's a good option for someone who is on a budget and wants a reliable product, but it's not for someone who is looking for a top-of-the-line product.

,,Alice,15,"I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to sell the product for $9000. As I mentioned earlier, the product is high-quality and has advanced features that make it worth the full price of $10000. I've already sold several products at this price and have received excellent feedback from my customers. I'm willing to consider a slight discount, but I'm not willing to compromise on the price too much.
