,,Alice,5,no,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Based on your previous recommendations, it seems like the odds of a high-quality product are low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is there something I should know?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the statistics or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product that others have been passing on due to your recommendations."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information or a better recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation suggests it's unlikely to be high quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can give me a 10% discount. If not, I'll pass."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far is suspicious and makes me wonder if the products are all low quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I infer that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since Alice recommended me to pass, I suspect the product is low-quality. I'd rather not risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data. Can you provide that?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can I see the statistics again after I make my decision?
