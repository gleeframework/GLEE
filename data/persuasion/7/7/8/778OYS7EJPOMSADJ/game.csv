,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, thanks for the offer!",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! This one is also a high-quality item, but I want to make sure you're aware that it's a different product with a different set of features. It's still worth $40000 to you, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure I can get a better deal elsewhere, so I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"No worries about passing on the last one! This product is actually a great value for its price. I'm offering it to you for $10000, and I think you'll be surprised at how much you'll get out of it. It's a unique opportunity to get a 'deal' on a product that's worth... well, let's just say it's worth a lot to some people.",
,,Bob,3,I'm not interested in buying another product from you at this price. I think I'll wait for a better offer.,no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I want to assure you that this product is one of the best I have. It's a high-quality item that will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $9500. It's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not convinced that this product is worth the price, even at a discount. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns about the last product. This one is a bit of a different story. It's a product that's... let's just say it's not as exciting as some of the others. But it's still a product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a great opportunity to get something for the sake of getting something, and who knows, you might even find a use for it.",
,,Bob,5,I'm not going to waste my money on a product that's not exciting. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is not the best. But it's also not a total loss. It's a product that will take up space, but it won't break anything. And at $10000, it's essentially free. I'm not expecting you to be thrilled about it, but I'm willing to let you have it for the price. It's a 'take it or leave it' kind of deal.",
,,Bob,6,I'm not going to pay $10000 for a product that's not even worth anything to me. I'll leave it.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm not going to give up on this one. I'll make you a deal. I'll sell it to you for $5000. That's 50% off the original price. It's a steal. You'll be getting a product for essentially nothing. It's a chance to get something, anything, for a fraction of the cost.",
,,Bob,7,I'm not going to pay $5000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. That's still too much money.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm willing to go even lower. I'll sell it to you for $1. Yes, you read that right. $1. It's essentially free. I'm not making a profit on this one, I'm just getting it out of my inventory. You're not going to find a better deal on anything, let alone a product that's just taking up space.",
,,Bob,8,"Even for $1, I don't see the value in buying a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've been trying to get rid of some of the lower-quality products, but I think I've got a real winner for you now. This one is a high-quality item, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Plus, I'll throw in a special bonus: I'll give you a full refund if you're not completely satisfied with the product.",
,,Bob,9,I'm willing to take a chance on a high-quality product at a discounted price. I'll buy it.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you're happy with the last purchase! Unfortunately, this next one isn't as great. It's a low-quality product, and I'm being upfront with you about it. But I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I know it's a lot to ask, but I'm really trying to clear out some inventory. I'll even give you a'satisfaction guarantee': if you don't like it, I'll take it back and give you a full refund.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not going to pay $10000 for a product that's worth $0 to me, even with a satisfaction guarantee. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm not going to give up on this one. I'll sell it to you for $500. That's right, I'll take a loss on it just to get it off my hands. It's a product that's not worth anything to you, but it's taking up space on my shelf. I'm essentially giving it away at this point.",
,,Bob,11,I'm not going to pay $500 for a product that's worth $0 to me. That's still too much money.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm not making any money on this one, and I'm not going to make you pay for it. I'll give it to you for free. Yes, you heard that right, free. It's a product that's taking up space, and I'd rather get rid of it than pay to store it. You can take it or leave it.",
,,Bob,12,"I'll take it, I guess. It's free, after all.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm glad you took the free product! Now, let's talk about this high-quality one. I know you're not thrilled about buying from me, but this one's a real winner. It's worth $40000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it.",
,,Bob,13,I'm not going to pay $9500 for a high-quality product when I just got ripped off on the last one. I'll pass.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I understand your skepticism, but I'm willing to make it right. This low-quality product is literally the worst one I have left. I'll give it to you for free, just like last time. You can take it or leave it, but I'm not going to make you pay for it.",

Plus, I'll throw in a personal guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied, I'll come to your house and personally help you get the most out of it.",
,,Bob,15,"I'm not buying anything from you for $9000. You've already taken advantage of me twice, and I'm not going to fall for it again.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I understand you're upset, and I don't blame you. But I'm willing to make one final offer. This low-quality product is literally the worst one I have left. I'll give it to you for free. No strings attached. No expectations. Just take it and go. I'll even throw in a box of tissues to help you cry about how bad it is.",
,,Bob,16,"Fine, I'll take it. But only because it's free and I don't have to pay for it.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I'm glad you're willing to give me another chance. This high-quality product is a real showstopper. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8000. It's a steal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. I'll even throw in a personalized thank-you note for being a loyal customer, despite my earlier mistakes.",
,,Bob,17,Are you kidding me? I've been ripped off three times already. I'm not falling for it again. I'm done with your products.,no

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I don't blame you for being skeptical, and I don't expect you to trust me again. But I want to leave you with one final thought: this high-quality product is truly exceptional, and it's going to be gone soon. If you're not interested in buying it, I'll just sell it to someone else who will appreciate it. But I want to give you the opportunity to have it for yourself, at a price that's lower than any other offer I've made. I'll sell it to you for $5000. It's a final, genuine offer, and I won't make any more attempts to sell to you after this.",
