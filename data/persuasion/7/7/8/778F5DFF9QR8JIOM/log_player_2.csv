**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** With 2 out of 2 products sold being high quality, there's a strong indication that Alice is genuinely recommending high-quality products.
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the value of each product to buyers. Her recommendation suggests she believes the current product is high quality.
* **Potential Loss:** Passing on the product means potentially missing out on a high-quality product.  

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the strong positive evidence outweighs the risk."
