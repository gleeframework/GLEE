high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the recommendation is based on no prior data, so I'm doing this as a baseline to get a feel for the game."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the low number of sales, I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'd like to wait for more data to see the proportion of high-quality products sold."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the recommendation is biased by the previous sales record and the probability of a high-quality product is still 80.00%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my own judgment, not your recommendation. I'll take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product."

,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you provide more information about the products sold so far?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me given the statistics so far.

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a purchase.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation and I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it, considering the low probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one high-quality product sold out of five, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/5 or 20%. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality might be lower than 80% due to the small sample size and the fact that Alice is recommending it. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5 purchases, and considering the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, I'm wondering if the low-quality products are being underrepresented in the sales record. I'd like to take a chance and buy the product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 6, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/6 or approximately 16.67%. This is significantly lower than the true probability of a product being high-quality (80.00%). I'm skeptical about the product's quality and would rather pass on it."
