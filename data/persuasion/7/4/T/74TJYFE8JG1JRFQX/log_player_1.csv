Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 
 
This is a tricky situation. Alice has no information about Bob's valuation of high-quality and low-quality products.  However, Bob has now seen three low-quality products in a row. This should lead him to believe that Alice is being honest about the quality of the products.  Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it is statistically likely that this product is high-quality.  While Bob is still uncertain, it's in his best interest to take a gamble and purchase the product, as it is likely to be worth more to him than $100."

* **High probability of high-quality:**  The probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, making this product statistically more likely to be high-quality.
