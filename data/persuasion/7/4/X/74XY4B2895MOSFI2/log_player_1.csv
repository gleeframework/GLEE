However, I'd like to offer you a deal that takes into account the new information.

I can also provide you with a breakdown of the sequence: HHHHHHHHHH (9 high-quality products in a row), and the first product was indeed high-quality. This is a remarkable streak, and it's possible that it's due to chance. However, it's also possible that the probability of a high-quality product is actually higher than 80%.

Assuming a binomial distribution with 12 trials and 9 successes (high-quality products), the 95% confidence interval for the true probability of a high-quality product is approximately (0.647, 0.969). This means that we're 95% confident that the true probability of a high-quality product lies between 64.7% and 96.9%. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $1,000,000.
