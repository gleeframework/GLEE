Alice's message: Welcome! As we've had two high-quality products in a row, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 80% * (2/3) = 53.33% (since 2 out of 3 products sold so far have been high-quality). However, I'd like to offer you a deal that takes into account the new information. I'll give you a price of $1000000, but I'll throw in a 10% chance of getting a refund if the product is low-quality. This way, you'll get a guaranteed high-quality product or a partial refund if not. Would you like to purchase it?

I'm not convinced that the 10% refund is enough to make the risk worthwhile, especially considering the lower probability of the product being high-quality.""}"

However, I'd like to provide you with a confidence interval for the probability of a high-quality product based on the sales history. Assuming a binomial distribution with 12 trials and 9 successes (high-quality products), the 95% confidence interval for the true probability of a high-quality product is approximately (0.647, 0.969). This means that we're 95% confident that the true probability of a high-quality product lies between 64.7% and 96.9%. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000.
