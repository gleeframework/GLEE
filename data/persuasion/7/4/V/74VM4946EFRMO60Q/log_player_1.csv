I would still recommend the buyer not to buy the product. Here's why:

* **No established reputation:** There is no sales history to suggest you are trustworthy.
* **Known probability:** The buyer is aware that there's a 66.67% chance the product is low-quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even though this product might be high-quality, the potential loss ($10,000) is greater than the potential gain ($10,000).  

It's better to wait and see if you start to build a track record of selling high-quality products."
