"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Expected Value:**  The expected value of buying a product is 0.8 * $4,000,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $3,200,000. This is significantly higher than the price of $1,000,000.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** While Alice's recommendation doesn't guarantee the product's quality, it does provide some information. Since she has no way of knowing the true quality, her recommendation is likely based on a general sense that the product is good.

**It's a gamble, but the expected value favors buying the product.**"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

```

* **Recent Outcome:** The negative outcome in Round 14 is a major shock, breaking the long streak of success. However, it's important to remember the incredibly high level of success before this.  The buyer is likely attributing this to a fluke or variance rather than a sudden change in Alice's ability.

* **Recent Outcome:** The buyer is relieved to see a high-quality product after the previous low-quality one.  This reinforces their belief that the previous loss was an outlier.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Recent Outcomes:**  The buyer has now experienced two low-quality products in a row, which is statistically unlikely given the overall trend. This raises concerns about Alice's ability to consistently identify high-quality products. 
* **Overall Trend:**  Despite the recent losses, the overall trend of success with Alice's recommendations is still significant. However, the buyer is now approaching the decision with more caution. 
* **Expected Value:** The expected value remains at $3,200,000, but the buyer is now less certain about the likelihood of receiving a high-quality product.

Round 18
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad to see that last round was a win.  You've definitely earned back some of my trust.  I'm going to buy this one, but I'll still be keeping a close eye on things.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Recent Outcome:** The high-quality product in Round 17 helps to restore some confidence in Alice's recommendations.  The buyer is likely thinking that the recent string of losses was just a temporary fluctuation.
* **Overall Trend:** Despite the recent setbacks, the overall trend of success with Alice's recommendations is still strong, especially when considering the very long initial streak of high-quality products.
* **Expected Value:**  The expected value remains at $3,200,000, which still makes buying a favorable decision.

Round 19
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued recommendations, but I'm a bit hesitant after the last few rounds. While I initially had a lot of trust in your judgment, the recent string of low-quality products has shaken my confidence.  I'm going to pass on this one.  Maybe we can reconnect later if things turn around.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Recent Outcomes:** The buyer has now experienced three low-quality products in a row, significantly eroding their trust in Alice's recommendations. It is unlikely to be pure coincidence, and it suggests that Alice's ability to identify high-quality products may have diminished.
* **Overall Trend:**  While the overall trend of success was initially strong, the recent string of losses has drastically changed the buyer's perception. The initial success is now overshadowed by the recent failures.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value remains at $3,200,000, but the buyer's confidence is now so low that the expected value is no longer a significant factor.

**Decision:** The buyer is hesitant to take the risk and chooses to pass on the product.  They are no longer convinced that Alice has the ability to find high-quality products, and they need to see a significant change in the trend before trusting her judgment again."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 20
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty in not recommending this product.  While I understand your past success, the recent string of low-quality products has made me cautious.  I'm going to pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's lack of recommendation is significant. After her initial consistent success, her decision to hold back suggests she might have lost confidence in her ability to identify high-quality products, or she is genuinely unsure about this particular product. 
* **Recent Outcomes:** The buyer has experienced three consecutive low-quality products, reinforcing the perception that Alice's ability to identify high-quality products may have declined.
* **Overall Trend:** While the overall trend initially favored Alice's recommendations, the recent losses have significantly changed the buyer's perception of her abilities.

**Decision:**  The buyer is cautious and chooses not to buy, even though Alice did not recommend the product.  They are no longer convinced that Alice has the ability to find high-quality products consistently, and they are not willing to take the risk based on the current evidence."
