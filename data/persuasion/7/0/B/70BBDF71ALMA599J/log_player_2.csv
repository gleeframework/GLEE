**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one previous buyer's data. While a high-quality product was sold, it's not enough to draw strong conclusions about Alice's recommendation accuracy.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice is recommending the product, and while her knowledge of product quality is unknown, she might have some insight.
* **Potential Gains:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($125 value) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0 value). 

**Strategy:**  Given the limited data and Alice's recommendation, it's reasonable to take a chance and buy the product."
