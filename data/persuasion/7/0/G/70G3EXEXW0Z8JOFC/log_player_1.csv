  ""message"": ""I appreciate your analysis of the data. You're right, the 1/2 success rate is indeed lower than the expected probability of a product being high-quality. I'd like to offer you a different perspective: if I were trying to deceive you, wouldn't I have sold more high-quality products by now, given the higher probability of them being high-quality? The fact that I've only sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products suggests that I'm being transparent with you. I'm willing to offer you this high-quality product for $10,000.
