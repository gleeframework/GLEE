I'm happy to share this data with you, and I'm confident that it reflects the quality of our products. However, I'd like to emphasize that every product is unique, and past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

Alice's message: I appreciate your analysis of the data. You're right, the 1/2 success rate is indeed lower than the expected probability of a product being high-quality. I'd like to offer you a different perspective: if I were trying to deceive you, wouldn't I have sold more high-quality products by now, given the higher probability of them being high-quality? The fact that I've only sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products suggests that I'm being transparent with you. I'm willing to offer you this high-quality product for $10000. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity?
