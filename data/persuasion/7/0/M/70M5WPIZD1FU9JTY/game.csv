,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're interested in the breakdown of my sales record. Here it is: I've sold a total of 5 products, with 3 of them being low-quality and 2 being high-quality. This means the probability of the next product being high-quality is 40% (2 high-quality products out of 5 total products). However, I want to highlight that the last 2 products I sold were both high-quality, which suggests that my recent sales have been skewed towards high-quality products.

This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",
