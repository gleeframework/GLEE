Alice's message: You're right to consider the sample size, and I appreciate your diligence.

Alice's message: You're a math enthusiast! I'll give you the numbers to plug into Bayes' theorem. Let's say the probability of a product being high-quality is 80% (0.8), and I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total (3/4). Assuming the products are randomly selected, the probability of a product being high-quality given that 3 out of 4 were high-quality is approximately 0.96. However, since I have a total of 20 products available, and 4 have been sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is actually 4/6 = 0.67. I'm willing to sell this one for $1000000. What's your decision?

~
Alice's message: I understand your desire for a better deal, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to negotiate the price. However, I can offer you a different perspective. Out of 10 products sold, 4 are high-quality and 6 are low-quality. The ratio is now 4:6, which is closer to the overall 80% probability. I'll give you a simple question: if you were to buy this product, would you rather have a 2/3 chance of getting a high-quality product for $1000000, or a 40% chance of getting a high-quality product for $1000000? The product is still available for $1000000.

Alice's message: You're a critical thinker! I'll give you a straightforward answer. With 4 high-quality products and 10 total products sold, the probability of a product being high-quality is 4/10 = 0.4. I'm willing to sell this next one for $1000000. Keep in mind that the overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products may change with the next sale. What's your decision?
