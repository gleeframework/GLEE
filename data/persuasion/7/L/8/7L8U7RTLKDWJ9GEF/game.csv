,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
