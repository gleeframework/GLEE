* **Need for Explanation:**  To rebuild trust, Alice needs to provide a clear explanation for her recent recommendations.  This will help understand if her understanding of the products has changed, or if there are external factors influencing her decisions. 

At this point, a purely statistical approach is no longer sufficient. Alice's inconsistent recommendations introduce an element of uncertainty that needs to be addressed before making a buying decision."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 20
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

* **High Risk:** The potential loss from a low-quality product is significant, and the current situation doesn't justify the risk.

This response emphasizes a cautious approach. The past successes are no longer enough to trust Alice's recommendation blindly.  A detailed explanation is necessary before considering another purchase."
