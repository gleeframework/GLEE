I've sold 0 products so far, and I have no record of selling any high-quality products. However, I can tell you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%.

The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. However, since I've already sold one high-quality product, I can tell you that my sales record so far is consistent with the expected probability. I'm offering this next product to you for $100, which is still a fair price based on the market value.

This is a bit surprising, as we would expect to see some low-quality products by now. However, it's possible that I just got lucky. I want to be transparent with you - I'm still selling at the same price of $100, which is based on the market value of a product from me. But I'll give you a heads up: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, it would be a bit of an outlier in my sales record. What do you make of it? Will you take the chance and buy the product?""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Based on your sales record and the fact that two out of three buyers chose to purchase the product, I believe the probability of getting a high-quality product is still quite high. Considering the value of a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the cost ($100), I am willing to take the risk. Let's proceed with the purchase.

I want to be upfront with you - my sales record is no longer as consistent with the expected probability as it was before. In fact, it's a bit suspicious that I sold three high-quality products in a row. I'm still offering this product to you for $100, but I want to make it clear that the probability of it being high-quality is now lower than 80%. You might want to take that into account when making your decision. What do you think? Will you buy the product?""}"
