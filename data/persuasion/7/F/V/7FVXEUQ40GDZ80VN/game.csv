low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm curious about the quality and I'd like to be the first to see the outcome."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and since you're not recommending it, I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm taking a chance because the first buyer passed on the product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of the high-quality products have been sold yet, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd rather wait for more information or take a chance on a product that hasn't been recommended yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product, since Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, and she hasn't recommended any high-quality products yet, it's likely that the product is low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on your previous recommendations, I'm not confident that the product is high-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not going to take the risk based on your past recommendations. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the product and none have bought it, I'm starting to suspect that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the product might be low quality. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,

,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that the previous buyers were not recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations. Since 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the fact that 4 previous buyers have also received recommendations to buy, but none of them have purchased high-quality products yet.

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers were recommended to buy, and none of them received a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice might be recommending low-quality products, and I'd rather not take the risk."
