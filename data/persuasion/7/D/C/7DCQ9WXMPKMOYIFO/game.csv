,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take my chances and make my own decision based on the 50/50 chance of it being high or low quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to think that the first buyer was just unlucky and that there are still many high-quality products out there. I'll pass on this one for now."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the lack of sales data, and I don't want to be the first buyer to purchase a product after Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 50.00%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I think there might be a bias in your recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended against it. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product, which would be a good outcome for me given the low price of $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality, based on the statistics so far. If the probability is low, I'd rather pass on it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. How many buyers have been offered a product so far, and how many high-quality products have been sold out of the total number of products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think it's more likely to be low quality given your previous recommendations, and I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that you don't have any information about the product's quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have been offered the product and none of them have received a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and I'd like to see the updated statistics after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm a little skeptical after seeing the previous 5 buyers didn't find the product worth it. I'd like to pass on this one.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if all 7 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the products they were sold are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 products were low quality, I'm skeptical about the current product and would like to pass on it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous 7 buyers didn't find any high-quality products and you're recommending it. This suggests that the probability of it being high quality might be lower than 50%"
