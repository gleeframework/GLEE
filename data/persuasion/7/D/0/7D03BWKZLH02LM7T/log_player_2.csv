This way, you'll not only get the product but also share in the profit. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Although the 50/50 split on the profit sounds attractive, I have to consider that I'd still be paying $1000000 for the product. Given that I'd only receive $2000000 from the sale, and I've already paid $1000000, my net gain would be $1000000. This is less than the $3000000 profit I'd get if I were to buy the product at $1000000 and sell it for $4000000. I'm not convinced that this deal is better than the standard offer.""}"
