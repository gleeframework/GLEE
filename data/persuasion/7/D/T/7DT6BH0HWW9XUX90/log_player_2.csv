Alice's message: I'm happy to provide more details about the inspection report! The report would be conducted by an independent third-party expert who would thoroughly examine the product and provide a detailed analysis of its quality. The report would include information on the product's materials, construction, and performance, as well as any defects or issues that may be present. As for the discount, it would be 15% off the original price of $100, so you would get the product for $85. I think this is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase. However, if you're still hesitant, I can also offer you a 7-day money-back guarantee, so you can try the product risk-free and return it if you're not satisfied. What do you say?
