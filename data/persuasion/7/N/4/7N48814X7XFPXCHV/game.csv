Take this opportunity to own a piece of excellence.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm tempted by your confidence, Alice, but I'd like to think critically about the situation.

,,the buyer,15,"I'm not convinced by your statistics. 11 out of 13 is not significantly higher than 80%, and I'm not sure why you're trying to make a big deal out of it. I'd like to think that you're just lucky. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,the buyer,17,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'd like to think critically about the situation. With 9 out of 10 buyers purchasing high-quality products, it's likely that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. However, I'd like to know more about the 2 low-quality products that were sold. What happened to them? Were they returned or discarded? This information could help me make a more informed decision.",yes

,,Alice,18,"I'm glad you're thinking critically about the situation. As for the 2 low-quality products, I can assure you that they were not returned or discarded.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,

I've sold 18 high-quality products out of 19 total sales, which is a remarkable 94.7% success rate. Unfortunately, this product is the exception. I'm offering it to you for $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - it's not as valuable as the high-quality products I've been selling.
