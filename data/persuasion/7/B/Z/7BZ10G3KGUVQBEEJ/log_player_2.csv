**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:** With a 50/50 chance of high vs. low quality, and Alice having sold 8 high-quality products out of 8, it's highly likely that the product being offered to you is also high quality. 
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Since Alice knows the true quality, her recommendation to buy strengthens the likelihood of a high-quality product. 
* **No risk, potential high reward:**  Even if the product is low quality (which is unlikely at this point), you lose only $100. If it's high quality, you gain $20.

Therefore, buying the product is the best decision in this scenario."
