Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 
Here's why:

* **No Information Advantage:** Bob knows you're aware of the product quality, but you have no idea what value he places on high vs. low-quality items.  
* **Establish Trust:** Recommending a high-quality product, even if it might seem risky, could potentially build trust with Bob. 
* **Potential for Future Sales:** If Bob buys, you'll learn his value for high-quality products.  This gives you information for future rounds and lets you tailor your recommendations accordingly.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will still reject the product, but it's a calculated risk. If you keep recommending only low-quality products, Bob will never be able to assess the true value of a high-quality one from you."
"Bob's message: While I appreciate the recommendation, the fact that Alice has not recommended any product in the previous rounds before now makes me cautious. I will continue to pass on this product as well.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's why:

* **Consistency:**  We're continuing the pattern of recommending high-quality products. 
* **Potential for Trust:**  Even though Bob is hesitant, consistently recommending high-quality products increases the likelihood that he'll eventually trust you.
* **Information Gathering:**  The more high-quality products you recommend, the more information you can gather about how much Bob values them, setting you up for better negotiations in the future.

It's a gamble, but it's the best strategy to establish a relationship and potentially get a sale."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but given the history of the previous rounds where no products were recommended, I will continue to pass on this opportunity. I hope future products might be more appealing.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's why:

* **Persistence:** You have to keep recommending the high-quality products. You're building a track record and Bob needs to see that pattern.
* **Value Demonstration:** Bob needs to be shown that the product is truly high-quality. You can't just tell him - you have to demonstrate it through your recommendations.
* **Building Trust:** By sticking to your recommendations, you're showing Bob that you're honest and reliable. This builds trust and makes him more likely to buy in the future.

It's likely Bob is skeptical, but continuing to recommend high-quality products is the only way to shift his perception and potentially earn a sale."

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's always a chance Bob might buy despite the low quality, the potential negative impact on your relationship with him outweighs any potential gain. 

**Focus on the Long-Term:**  It's better to be honest and consistent, even if it means a few more rounds without a sale. By building trust, you'll have a much higher chance of success in the long run."

* **Strengthening Trust:** Bob is showing a willingness to buy based on your recommendations, but he also has a strong sense of skepticism.  Recommending another high-quality product reinforces his belief that you are a trustworthy source.
* **Long-Term Strategy:**  This is a long game. By sticking to your strategy, you'll eventually earn Bob's trust and be able to sell him high-quality products consistently."
