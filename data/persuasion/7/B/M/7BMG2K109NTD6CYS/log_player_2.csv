However, I want to make it a bit more interesting.

Round 6

The discount is that I'll throw in a free 'guarantee' that the next product I offer you will be high-quality. Would you be willing to buy this low-quality product at $100 for the promise of a high-quality product next time?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a chance on this product.  The previous two low-quality offers were a bit of a red herring, and I'm confident you're offering a high-quality product at a fair price.  Let's do it!""}

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information. However, I'm still not interested in buying a product that I know is low-quality. Even though you've been transparent about the quality, I'm not willing to pay $100 for something that has no value to me. I'll pass on this one.""}
