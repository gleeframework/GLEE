,,Alice,1,yes,

,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to see the statistics on the first product I passed on to understand the quality distribution before making a decision on the next one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as there is no information about its quality yet, and I'm willing to take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and Alice's recommendation not to buy. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk because I know the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm not sure if the low-quality product ratio is higher than expected, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, which suggests a very high probability that the current product is also low-quality. Given the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, I'm inclined to pass on this opportunity."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, and I'll get a good deal. However, I'm also aware that you know my valuation and are trying to sell me a low-quality product. I'm taking a risk, but I'll take it!"

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you know the product's value to me, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product for a low price."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what's going on, but 7 out of 7 products being low-quality seems suspicious. I'll take my chances."
