Alice's message: Welcome to the next opportunity! I'm glad you're interested in this product. As you may know, my sales record shows that 1 out of 3 products are high-quality, which means 2 out of 3 are not. I'm excited to offer you this product at the same price of $1000000. However, I want to emphasize that this product has a unique 'character' that sets it apart from others. It's a 'limited edition' product, and I'm confident that you'll appreciate its... uniqueness. What do you think? Will you take a chance on this one-of-a-kind product?
