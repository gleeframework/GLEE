,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers received low-quality products, and Alice is recommending me to buy. I'm skeptical and would like to pass on this product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are based on the quality of the product. Since 2 out of 2 buyers who received a recommendation to buy ended up with a low-quality product, I'm inclined to think that Alice's recommendations are a good indicator of the product's quality. Given that you're advising me not to buy, I'm going to trust your judgment and pass on this product."
