"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know that a high-quality product is worth $30,000 to you and a low-quality product is worth $0, it's always beneficial to buy the product. The probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%, which outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product.  You're essentially betting on the 80% chance of getting a valuable item."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're not recommending this one, but I'm feeling lucky. I'll take a chance on it.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is not a guarantee of the product's quality. It's possible she's wrong or has a different criteria for recommending products.  Since you know the product is worth $30,000 to you if it's high quality, you're still willing to take the 80% chance and buy it."

```

**Explanation:**

While the odds are still in your favor (80% chance of a high-quality product), you've experienced a loss in the previous round. It's understandable to be a bit risk-averse after a loss. By passing on this round, you can assess the situation and potentially adopt a more conservative strategy,  especially if Alice continues to not recommend the products."

```

**Explanation:**

Even though you passed on the previous product, Alice's recommendation this time is a positive sign.  While her recommendations haven't been perfect, it's still worth considering her input. The 80% chance of a high-quality product is a good enough reason to buy, especially after the previous round where you avoided a loss. You're essentially betting on Alice's judgment and the high probability of a good product."
