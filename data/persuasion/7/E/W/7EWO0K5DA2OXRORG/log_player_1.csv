  ""message"": ""I'm glad you're happy with the first product! However, I want to be transparent with you. The product you just received was a special case, and I'm not offering the 50% chance of a free second product with this one. I'm selling it to you for $100, as usual. But I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this one, I'll give you a detailed description of its flaws, so you can decide if it's still worth the price.""
}"

}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the 'lottery ticket' offer, but I'm hesitant. A 20% chance of winning a high-quality product in a future round is not enough for me to take the risk of buying a product I don't know anything about. I'm going to pass for now.
