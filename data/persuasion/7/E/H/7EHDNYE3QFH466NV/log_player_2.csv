Alice's message: Welcome to our store! I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a product from our collection. With 1 out of 3 products being high-quality, the chances of getting a valuable item are high. However, I want to be transparent with you - our sales record shows that 0 out of 1 product sold so far has been high-quality. Would you like to take a chance and see if you get a high-quality product this time?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on this one. With no high-quality products sold yet, the probability of the first product being high-quality is actually 1/3. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.""
