low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered, based on the fact that none have been sold yet and the seller's recommendations have been against buying."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she knows the product's quality, and she's trying to sell it to me. Since the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, I'd rather wait for the next product, which might have a higher chance of being high-quality based on the updated statistics."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products recommended by you were low-quality. I think it's more likely that this product is low-quality as well."

,,Alice,14,yes,
