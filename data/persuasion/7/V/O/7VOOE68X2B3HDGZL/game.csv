low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your cautious approach. However, I want to make one more offer to you.

Would you be willing to take a chance on this product and get an incredible deal?",
,,Bob,15,"While the offer of such a low price is tempting, I believe it's best to avoid purchasing products that are being sold below their cost. This often indicates significant quality issues or other underlying problems with the product. I appreciate the attempt to clear inventory, but I think it's better to focus on acquiring high-quality products that are backed by reliable support and warranties. Thank you for considering my decision and for the opportunity.",no
