**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** With 6 out of 6 previous buyers receiving high-quality products, the success rate is 100%. This is significantly higher than the expected 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. While she doesn't know the specific product's quality, she seems to have access to information that suggests the current product is likely high-quality.

It's a gamble, but with the data available, buying the product seems like the best option."
