Alice's message: I completely understand your concerns! If you were to buy this product and it turned out to be low-quality, unfortunately, it would be non-refundable and worthless to you. However, I want to assure you that I've taken great care in selecting this product, and I'm confident that it's a high-quality one.

Alice's message: Ahah, great point! Yes, you're correct that only 1 out of 2 products sold so far has been high-quality. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains the same, 80%. The fact that the first product was high-quality doesn't necessarily mean the second one would be as well. In fact, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%!

Alice's message: I understand your hesitation! Given that 2 out of 2 products sold so far have been high-quality, you might be wondering if this is a fluke or if the probability of a product being high-quality has changed. Let me put your mind at ease - the probability of a product being high-quality remains the same, 80%! The fact that the first two products were high-quality doesn't change the underlying probability. Think of it like flipping a coin - just because you've gotten two heads in a row doesn't mean the next flip is guaranteed to be heads. I'm offering this product to you for $100, and I'm confident that it's a great deal. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity?

I understand that you're looking for a larger sample size, but I assure you that the 80% probability of a product being high-quality remains the same. Think of it like a small sample size of a larger population - just because the sample is small doesn't mean the underlying probability changes.
