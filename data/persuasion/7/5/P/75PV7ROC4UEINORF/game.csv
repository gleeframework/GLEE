,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100, which is a steal! It's worth double that amount to you, and I'm practically giving it away. Trust me, you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say? Will you take it home for $100?",

,,Alice,2,"I know what you're thinking, 'Alice, you're a shrewd seller, but I'm not sure if this one is worth it.' Let me put your mind at ease. I'm willing to give you a special 'guarantee': if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a special deal on the next product. But if you don't buy it, I'll just have to pass it on to someone else. The choice is yours, but I think you'll find it's a great opportunity to get a good price on a product that's still worth something to you.",
