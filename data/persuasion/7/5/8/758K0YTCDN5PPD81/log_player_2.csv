If I were trying to deceive you, I would have sold you a high-quality product again, but instead, I'm offering you a product that I know is low-quality. This is a chance to get a deal on a product that's not as good as the one I sold last time. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, the same price as the high-quality one. Think carefully before making a decision.

The fact that I offered a low-quality product at the same price as the high-quality one is not a ruse, but rather a genuine attempt to be transparent. I'm willing to sell you this low-quality product for $100, but I'll also tell you that I have a 33.33% chance of selling a high-quality product in each round.

Alice's message: I'm glad you took the risk and bought the product! Unfortunately, it was a low-quality one, so you won't have any new information to share.

I'm starting to think that my initial product was just a fluke. I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $100, but I want to warn you that it's possible I've already sold all my high-quality products.
