This is an incredible deal, and I'm willing to make a significant concession to get it off my hands. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else at a higher price. What do you say?

I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1000000, but I need you to make a decision now.

I'm confident that it's one of the best products I've ever had the pleasure of selling. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $1000000.
