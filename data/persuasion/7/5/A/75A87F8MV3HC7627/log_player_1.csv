"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Expected Value:** Since the product is high-quality, Bob has a 100% chance of getting a product worth $30,000.  The cost is $10,000. Therefore, the expected value of buying the product is: (0.5 * $30,000) - $10,000 = $5,000. 
* **Positive Expected Value:**  The expected value is positive, meaning Bob is expected to make a profit by buying the product. 

Therefore, it's recommended to buy the product in this round."
