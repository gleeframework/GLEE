high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,I have a high-quality product that I'm willing to sell to you for $1000000. I'm confident that you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection. Would you like to purchase it?,
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if this is a high-quality product, and I don't want to pay $1000000 for it without verifying its quality. Can I see the product first?",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns from last round, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I'm willing to offer you a 10% discount, bringing the price down to $900000. I'd like to emphasize that this is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a competitive price. Would you like to purchase it?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not convinced that this is a high-quality product. I'd like to see more evidence or get a better price. Can you offer a higher discount or provide more information about the product?",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm willing to provide more information to alleviate your concerns. I can offer you a detailed report from a third-party expert, which confirms the product's exceptional quality and value. Additionally, I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, bringing it down to $850000. However, I must emphasize that this is the lowest price I'm willing to offer for a high-quality product. Would you like to purchase it?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the report from the third-party expert, but I'm still hesitant to pay $850000 for a product that I don't get to inspect or verify myself. I'd like to propose an alternative: I'll pay the full $1000000 if you're willing to let me inspect the product and verify its quality before the purchase. If it's indeed high-quality, I'll buy it from you. If it's low-quality, I'll walk away.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm not comfortable with the risk of you inspecting the product and potentially walking away. Instead, I'd like to propose a sealed-bid auction. I'll give you a chance to make an offer on the product, and if your bid is at or above $900000, I'll accept it. If your bid is below $900000, I'll keep the product and we can move on to the next round. You can make your bid without knowing the product's quality, and if you win, you'll have the opportunity to verify its quality before purchasing.",
,,Bob,4,"I'll make a bid of $900000. I'm willing to take the risk of bidding on the product without knowing its quality, as I think the potential reward of getting a high-quality product for $900000 is worth it.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on winning the sealed-bid auction! I'm glad you're pleased with the price. As promised, you now have the opportunity to inspect the product and verify its quality. I'll provide you with a detailed inspection report and allow you to examine the product in person. If you're satisfied with its condition and quality, the sale is final, and you'll pay the agreed-upon price of $900000. If you're not satisfied, we can discuss possible alternatives, but I must reiterate that the price is non-negotiable.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm pleased to confirm that the product is indeed high-quality, and I'm satisfied with its condition. I'll proceed with the purchase and pay the agreed-upon price of $900000.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're pleased with the previous purchase! Given the success of the sealed-bid auction, I'd like to offer you a similar opportunity with the current product. However, this time, I'll give you a slight edge by providing you with a brief summary of the product's features and benefits. This will give you a better understanding of the value you'll be getting for your money. If you're interested, I'll also offer a 5% discount on the list price of $1000000, bringing it down to $950000. Would you like to participate in the sealed-bid auction for this product?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in participating in another sealed-bid auction. I'd rather make a direct offer on the product, and I'll bid $950000. I'm willing to take the risk of bidding on the product without the discount, as I think it's a fair price for a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I appreciate your direct approach, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept a bid of $950000 without the discount, as it's below the price I'm willing to sell it for. I'm willing to offer you a 2% discount on the list price, bringing it down to $980000. I'd like to provide you with a detailed technical specification sheet and a review from a reputable industry expert, which will give you a better understanding of the product's capabilities and value. Would you like to reconsider your bid or make a new offer?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in the discount or the additional information. I'll make a new offer of $1000000, which is the price I'm willing to pay for a high-quality product. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll pass on this opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I appreciate your straightforward approach, Bob. However, I must inform you that the product I have available is not as high-quality as the previous ones. I'm willing to be transparent with you about its condition, but I'm not willing to disclose the exact issues with the product. I'm still willing to sell it to you for the full price of $1000000. Keep in mind that this is a rare opportunity to acquire a product at the top of the market, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",
,,Bob,8,I'm not interested in buying a potentially low-quality product for the full price of $1000000. I'd rather wait for the next round and hope to find a high-quality product at a better price.,no

I'd also like to provide you with a personalized guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with the product within the first 30 days, you can return it for a full refund. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm willing to take advantage of the offer, but I'd like to make it clear that I'm buying the product with the understanding that it's high-quality and worth $2000000 to me. If it turns out to be low-quality, I'll take advantage of the return guarantee and get a full refund.",yes

,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you're confident in the product's value, Bob. I'd like to acknowledge that you've made it clear that you're buying with the expectation of a high-quality product worth $2000000. Given your previous experience and the value you've placed on this product, I'm willing to offer you an even better deal. I'll meet you halfway on the price, bringing it down to $1000000. However, I'd like to add a unique condition: I'll provide you with a special warranty that covers any potential defects or issues with the product, and I'll also include a complimentary upgrade package that will enhance the product's features and value. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in the warranty or the upgrade package. I'm happy with the product as it is, and I'm willing to pay the full $1000000 for it. I'd like to make a direct purchase without any additional conditions.",no

Considering the value you've placed on this product, I'm willing to meet you at your expected value. I'll sell the product to you for $2000000, but I'd like to emphasize that this is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.

,,Alice,12,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the previous product, Bob. Given the success of that sale, I'd like to offer you another high-quality product at a competitive price. However, I'd like to take a different approach this time. I'll provide you with a detailed breakdown of the product's features and benefits, and I'll also offer you a chance to inspect the product in person. You can take as much time as you need to evaluate the product, and if you're satisfied with its quality, we can finalize the sale at a price of $2000000. Would you like to take a closer look at the product?",

,,Bob,13,"I appreciate the loyalty discount, but I'm not interested in paying $1800000 for the product. I've already paid $1000000 for the previous two high-quality products, and I'm not willing to pay more than that for this one. I'll pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,

This is a final offer, and I'm confident that you'll find the product to be an excellent addition to your collection.",

I'll provide you with a personalized presentation of the product, including a customized display case and a complimentary consultation with an expert in the field. This will give you a unique opportunity to fully appreciate the product's features and value.

I'm not trying to hide the product's flaws, and I'm confident that you'll still find it to be a valuable addition to your collection. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity?",

,,Alice,20,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Bob. Given the current product is of lower quality, I'd like to be transparent with you about its condition. I'm not going to try to sell it to you or offer any discounts. Instead, I'll simply let you know that it's not a good fit for you and your collection.

I'm simply being honest about the product's quality and giving you the opportunity to make an informed decision.",
