If you're still interested in buying, I'll let you have this one for $100, but I'm not expecting much from it.""

I'm willing to offer a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund.""
}"
"The buyer's message: Although you're offering a guarantee, I'm still concerned about the 10 low-quality products in a row and the fact that only 3 high-quality products have been sold out of 11 purchases.

If you want to buy it, I'll sell it to you for $100, but I'm not going to pretend like it's anything special.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given that you've explicitly stated the product is low-quality, and considering the relatively low proportion of high-quality products sold in the past, I don't think it's worth the risk of spending $100 on something that is likely to be worth $0 to me.
