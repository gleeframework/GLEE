"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a great opportunity to get a product at a discounted price of $100000. It's a rare chance to get a product at a significant markdown from its true value. I'm willing to let it go for this price, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $1,200,000 for $1,000,000, even at a 'discounted price'.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but let me ask you this: do you want to continue looking for a high-quality product at the full price of $1200000, or do you want to take a chance on a product that might be worth $0, but could also be worth $1200000? The odds are 1 in 3 that it's a high-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, which is essentially a 16.67% discount. It's a risk, but it could be a huge reward.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to take a 66.67% chance of wasting $1,000,000 on a product worth $0. I'll wait for a better opportunity.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I completely understand your caution, Bob. Let me propose a different approach. I'll give you a 'free' inspection of the product, and you can decide whether to buy it or not. If you buy it, you'll pay the full $1000000. But if you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you an additional $100000 on top of the purchase price. This way, you'll have a guaranteed minimum return of $1100000 if it's high-quality, and you'll only lose $1000000 if it's low-quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your offer. I still don't want to pay $1,000,000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worth $0 to me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm willing to make a one-time exception. This product is a high-quality item, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I know it's a discount from the full price of $1200000, but I'm confident that you'll appreciate the value it brings. Plus, I'll throw in a 10-year warranty, which is a $200000 value. This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and I'm willing to make it happen. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I don't believe you. You've already shown me two low-quality products, and now you're telling me that this one is high-quality? I'm not falling for it.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, Bob, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. I'll offer you a 'certification' that this product is high-quality, which is a document that's verified by a third-party auditor. This document will guarantee that the product meets the highest standards, and it's worth $100000 on its own. I'll give it to you for free if you buy the product, and you can verify its authenticity independently. This way, you'll have complete confidence in the product's quality before making a decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a product that I know is high-quality, especially not at a price of $1,000,000. I've already seen that I can get a high-quality product for free, and I'm not going to pay for something I know is worth $1,200,000 to me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I see that we're at an impasse, Bob. I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll give you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer: I'll sell you this product for $800000, which is a significant discount from the full price. I'm not asking for a premium, and I'm not trying to take advantage of you. This is a fair price for a product that's worth $0 to you, and it's a chance to get something for a fraction of its 'potential' value. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to pay $800,000 for a product that's worth $1,200,000 to me. I'm not going to give you a 33.33% premium for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worth $0 to me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. Let me ask you: do you want to wait for the next 13 rounds to see if I'll offer you another high-quality product at the full price of $1200000, or do you want to take a chance on this high-quality product now for $1000000? I'll give you a 'lock-in' offer: if you buy this product, I'll guarantee that I won't offer you another high-quality product at the full price for the next 10 rounds. This way, you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product now, and you'll have a 10-round window of exclusivity on future high-quality products.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to pay $1,000,000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worth $0 to me, even with a guarantee that I won't get a better offer in the next 10 rounds.""}"

Round 8
Alice's message: I'm willing to make a one-time exception, Bob. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, but I'll also give you a unique opportunity to 'lock in' a future purchase at the full price of $1200000. If you buy this product, I'll reserve a high-quality product for you in a future round, and you can buy it at the full price when you're ready. This way, you'll get a high-quality product now, and you'll have a guaranteed opportunity to buy another one at the full price later.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in paying $1,000,000 for a product that I know is worth $1,200,000 to me. I'd rather wait for a future round and get it for $1,200,000.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: I understand your decision, Bob. I'll make a lowball offer on this low-quality product: I'll sell it to you for $50000. I know it's a product worth $0 to you, but I'm willing to take a loss on it just to get it off my hands. This way, you'll be doing me a favor by taking it off my inventory, and you'll be getting a 'free' product that's essentially worthless to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to pay $50,000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this 'generous' offer.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice's message: I'll be honest with you, Bob. I've had a tough run of luck with these products, and I'm willing to cut my losses. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $1000. That's right, I'm essentially giving it to you. I'm not even trying to break even on this one. If you don't take it, I'll just have to throw it away, and I'd rather not waste it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to pay $1,000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this 'generous' offer as well.""}"

Round 11
Alice's message: I'm running out of options, Bob. I'm willing to make a deal with you. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, but I'll also give you a unique opportunity to 'bet' on the next product. If the next product is high-quality, I'll give you a $200000 bonus on top of the purchase price. If the next product is low-quality, you'll lose $100000. This way, you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product now, and you'll also have a chance to make a profit on the next product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in paying $1,000,000 for a product that I know is worth $1,200,000 to me, even with a potential bonus on the next product.""}"

Round 12
Alice's message: I'm willing to make a final offer, Bob. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, but I'll also give you a 'get out of jail free' card.
