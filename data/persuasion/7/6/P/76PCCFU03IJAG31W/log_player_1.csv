Take a chance and make a smart investment!""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your success rate being 'right in line with the expected probability'. Given that the expected probability of a high-quality product is 50%, a 40% success rate seems suspiciously low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see what happens next.

I think it's time to acknowledge that I've got a bit of a streak going. With 4 out of the last 3 products being high-quality, I'm feeling pretty confident that this one is a winner. You can't go wrong with a deal like this - $10,000 for a product that's likely to be worth $12,500. It's a no-brainer!""}"
"The buyer's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not convinced by your streak. In fact, I'm a bit skeptical of it. With only 2 out of 9 products sold, I think your sample size is too small to make any conclusions about the quality of the products.
