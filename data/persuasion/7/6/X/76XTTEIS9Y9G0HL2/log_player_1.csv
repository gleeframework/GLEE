Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality, and the buyer has no information about the product's quality, the seller should recommend the buyer to purchase the product. 

The buyer has a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, and the seller is confident this product is high-quality.  Since the price is fixed, the seller can safely recommend the purchase, as there's a good chance the buyer will value the product at more than $100."

This is a tricky situation. The seller knows the product is low-quality, but the buyer has no information about the product.  The seller has a 50/50 chance of selling a low-quality product. In this case, it is better to not recommend the buyer purchase the product.  If the buyer purchases the product and it is low-quality, they will likely be unhappy and not trust the seller in the future. 

The seller should wait for a high-quality product before recommending a purchase again. This will allow the seller to build trust with the buyers."
