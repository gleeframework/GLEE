low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as a pioneer, but I'm not sure what to expect. I'll buy it and see what happens!"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to see more data on the previous sales before making a decision.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,"I want to be transparent with you. The first product I sold was low-quality, but the last two products I've had were high-quality. I'm telling you this because I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. This product is also high-quality, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item."
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the product is more likely to be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $10000 on a product worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,"I understand that the statistics might not be in my favor, but I want to assure you that I've had three high-quality products in a row now. I'm willing to put my reputation on the line for this product. If you buy it and it's not high-quality, I'll make sure to let future buyers know that I made a mistake. I believe in this product, and I think it's worth the investment."
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"I want to be transparent about my sales record. Out of 1 product sold, 0 were high-quality, but that was just a single incident. I've had 5 high-quality products since then, including this one. I believe this product is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item worth $12500 for $10000. I assure you that this product is high-quality, and I'm willing to stake my reputation on it."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 1 buyer has passed on the product, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is low. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"I think there's been a misunderstanding about the statistics. Out of 1 product sold, 0 were high-quality, but that's because the first buyer took a risk and bought a low-quality product. Since then, I've had 6 high-quality products, including this one, but none of them have been sold. I assure you that this product is high-quality, and I'm willing to stake my reputation on it. I believe this product is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item worth $12500 for $10000."
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 attempt, which means there's a 50% chance that the product is low quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"I want to be upfront about my sales record. Out of 2 products sold, 0 were high-quality, but I've had 7 high-quality products that didn't get sold. This product is also high-quality, and I'm confident that it's worth the investment. I assure you that I'm committed to transparency and honesty, and I wouldn't recommend this product if I didn't believe in its quality."
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better deal or more information before making a decision.

,,Alice,10,yes,"I understand that my sales record might not be convincing, but I want to assure you that I've had 8 high-quality products, including this one, that didn't get sold. The two products that were sold were a low-quality product that I didn't recommend, and another low-quality product that I advised against buying, but the buyer decided to take the risk anyway. I believe this product is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item worth $12500 for $10000. I'm willing to stake my reputation on its quality."

Please consider the fact that I've been advising against buying low-quality products, and I'm only recommending this one because I truly believe in its value."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 buyers have already been presented with the product and none of them bought it, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,18,no,"I strongly advise against buying this product. I've been transparent about the quality of my products, and I can assure you that this one is low-quality. I've had several high-quality products in the past that didn't get sold, but this one doesn't meet the standards I want to uphold. Please don't take the risk, and wait for a better opportunity."
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm not sure if it's a high or low quality product, but since the previous 4 buyers didn't buy the products after Alice's recommendations, I'm assuming that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since Alice is not recommending it, I'm assuming it's a low-quality product. I'll take the risk and buy it, but I'm not expecting to get $12500 for it."
