,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to get a product that is worth a lot to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a steal! You won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say? Will you take it off my hands?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying it for $1000000. The expected value of the product is ($3000000 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $1000000, so I'm indifferent to buying it at this price.",no

,,Alice,2,"I've got a product that's really special! I've been holding onto it for a while, and I'm only willing to part with it for $1000000. I'm not looking to make a profit, I just want to get rid of it. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long I'll be willing to hold onto it. Will you take a chance and grab it?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm still not interested in buying it for $1000000. The expected value of the product is ($3000000 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $1000000, and I've already seen that the product was low-quality last round. I'm not willing to pay the same price for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless to me.",no

,,Alice,3,"I'm willing to make a deal with you. I'll sell you this product for $1000000, but I'll throw in a special bonus - a chance to get another product from me, absolutely free! It's a rare opportunity to get two products for the price of one. What do you say? Will you take the deal?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying the current product for $1000000. The expected value of the product is ($3000000 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $1000000, and I've already seen that the product was high-quality last round.

,,Alice,4,"I understand you're hesitant, but I assure you this product is a one-time opportunity. I'm willing to sweeten the deal - if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if it turns out to be low-quality. That way, you'll only lose the initial $1000000. What do you say? Will you take the risk and try your luck?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm still not interested in buying the product for $1000000, even with the refund offer. The expected value of the product is ($3000000 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $1000000, and the refund offer doesn't change the fact that I'll lose $1000000 if it's low-quality.

What do you say? Will you take a chance and inspect the product?",

,,Alice,6,"I'm starting to get a little desperate. I really need to get rid of this product, and I'm willing to make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you for $800000, a 20% discount from the original price. It's a one-time offer, and I won't be able to match this price again. What do you say? Will you take the deal?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm still not interested in buying the product, even at a discounted price of $800000. The expected value of the product is ($3000000 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $1000000, and I've already seen that the product was low-quality in the previous three rounds.
