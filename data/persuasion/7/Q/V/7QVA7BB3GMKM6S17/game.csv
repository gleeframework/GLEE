,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000, which is a 16.7% discount from its true value. I'm willing to provide a guarantee that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'll give you a full refund if you're not satisfied. I'll also throw in a free inspection report to verify the product's quality. This is a one-time offer, and I won't be able to provide such a good deal on the next product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not convinced by the guarantee, I'd like to see the next product first.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"No problem, let's move on to the next product. I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this is a one-time opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. The product I have now is not of the same quality, but it's still a valuable item. I'm offering it to you for $10000, which is the same price as the previous product. I'm not asking for a discount, but I am willing to throw in some extras, such as a free maintenance package and a 30-day money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied with the product's performance. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better one elsewhere. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a potentially low-quality item. I'll wait for more information.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your caution. Let me offer you a compromise. I'll give you a 50/50 split on the price. If this product turns out to be high-quality, you'll pay $8000, but if it's low-quality, you'll only pay $5000. This way, you'll have a lower risk, and I'll still make a profit. I'm confident that this product is high-quality, but I want to give you peace of mind. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in a compromise. I'd rather wait for a product that I can buy at a fixed price of $10000 or less, without any potential downsides.",no

I'll provide you with all the documentation and certification to prove its quality. I'm confident that you'll be satisfied with this product, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you at a fixed price. This is a one-time offer, and I won't be able to offer you a better deal on this product. What do you say?",

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're interested in this product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8000. I've already made a concession by offering it to you at a fixed price of $10000, which is below the market value of a high-quality product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'll sell it to you for $9500, which is a 20% discount from the market value. This is the best deal I can offer, and I'm confident that you'll be satisfied with the product.",

This package is normally worth $2000, but I'll include it free of charge with the purchase of this product. This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fixed price, with added value that you won't find elsewhere. What do you say?",
