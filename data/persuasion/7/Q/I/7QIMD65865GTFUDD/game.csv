low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"Five low-quality products in a row, I'm starting to feel like I'm in a bad streak. I'll pass again, but I'm starting to wonder if I should just take the risk and buy every product from now on, since the expected value of a high-quality product is $1333333.33 ($2000000 x 0.3333) and the cost of buying a low-quality product is only $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy this product, since the expected value of a high-quality product is $666666.67 ($2000000 x 0.3333) and I've already lost $4000000 on low-quality products. I'll take the risk and buy this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'm not learning from my mistakes! I'm going to buy this one too, since I've already lost $5000000 on low-quality products and I'm still hoping to get a high-quality one. The expected value is still in my favor, right?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm not learning from my mistakes! I'm going to buy this one too, since I've already lost $6000000 on low-quality products and I'm still hoping to get a high-quality one. I know I'm not being rational, but I'm going to keep taking the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"Wait, I think I've had enough of this streak of bad luck. I've lost $7000000 on low-quality products and I'm starting to think that Alice is just sending me low-quality products. I'll pass on this one and try to be more cautious."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Six low-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are not worth taking. I'll pass on this one and try to wait for a high-quality product recommendation, even if it means passing on many more products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"Seven low-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think that Alice's strategy is to get me to waste my money on low-quality products. I'll pass on this one and try to be more strategic in my decision-making."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'm going to take a break from passing and just buy this one. I've already lost a lot of money, so I might as well just take the risk and buy every product from now on. I'll just hope that eventually I'll get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,15,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,no,"Ugh, not again! I just lost another $1000000 on a low-quality product. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a bad indicator of the product quality. I'll pass on this one and try to be more cautious."
