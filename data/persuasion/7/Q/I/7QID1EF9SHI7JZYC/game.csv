,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if I can get a high-quality product at the low price of $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, it seems the probability of the product being high-quality is low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice's recommendation is against it, so I'm trying to test her recommendation."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the probability of the product being high-quality, not your recommendation."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products sold were low-quality, which is a very strong indication that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'm not willing to take the risk at this point."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on the fact that none of the previous 5 products sold were high-quality. I think the probability of the current product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to waste $100 on a low-quality product."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of your previous recommendations, but I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high quality, I suspect that the remaining products are more likely to be low quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products Alice is offering may be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable indicators of product quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the previous 6 buyers have also bought the product and none of them have gotten a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 6 buyers have already passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious about the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of the products have been high-quality, I'm concerned that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to buyers. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
