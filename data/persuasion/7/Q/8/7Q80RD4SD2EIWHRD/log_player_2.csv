**Reasoning:**

Even though the product has a 2/3 chance of being low quality, the information provided suggests a high-quality product is more likely. 

* **1 Buyer purchased:** This implies that the first buyer was likely presented with a high-quality product, as the low-quality product would have been worth $0 to them.
* **1 high-quality product sold:** This confirms that the first buyer indeed received a high-quality product.

While there's still a risk, the odds are better than the initial 1/3 chance of a high-quality product."
