As for this one, I've inspected it personally, and I can assure you that it meets the minimum standards for sale.

I've also conducted an internal audit, and the results show that 75% of the products inspected in the past week meet the high-quality standards. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1,200,000, and I'm willing to offer a 30-day warranty on this product, which is a first for me. I'm confident that this product is high-quality and will meet your expectations.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by the improved quality control process. The internal audit only looked at products from the past week, which may not be representative of the overall quality of the products.

Over the past three months, 40% of the products sold have been high-quality, and 60% have been low-quality.

We've implemented a new quality control checklist, re-trained our staff on quality control procedures, and increased the frequency of inspections. We've also implemented a new system for tracking and monitoring product quality. I've attached a comprehensive report to this message that outlines these changes and their effectiveness. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $400,000, as it's a low-quality product and the price reflects its value to you.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate the transparency and effort you've put into improving your quality control process, but I'm not convinced that the new measures have had a significant impact yet. With only three high-quality products sold out of fourteen, the probability of the current product being high-quality still seems low to me.
