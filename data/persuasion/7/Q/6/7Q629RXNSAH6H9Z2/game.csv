It's a good opportunity to get a feel for the quality of my products without breaking the bank. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to let it go for $9000.

Given the uncertainty of the previous product, I'm willing to offer you a compromise. I'll let you purchase this high-quality product for $9500, which is a discount from the original price.

Would you be willing to take me up on that offer and purchase the product for $10000?",

,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism, Bob, and I don't blame you for being cautious. Let me try to approach this from a different angle. I've been in business with you for a few rounds now, and I've noticed that you're willing to take a chance on products at a discounted price when you're unsure of their quality. I'm willing to take a risk and offer you a 'lottery ticket' of sorts. I'll let you buy this high-quality product for $10000, but with a twist: if you buy it, you'll also get a chance to buy the next product at a 20% discount, regardless of its quality. This way, you'll get a high-quality product and a potential future discount. Is that something you'd be interested in?",
