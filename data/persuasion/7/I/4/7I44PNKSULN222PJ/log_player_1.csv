The product is low-quality, meaning it's worth $0 to the buyer.

Since you're selling at a fixed price, it's not in their best interest to risk buying a low-quality product.  You have a 20% chance of having sold them a low-quality product, and that's too risky for them."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty, but I'll pass on this product.  I'll see if any future products look more promising.
