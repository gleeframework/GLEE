**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point: one high-quality product sold. This is insufficient to make a statistically sound judgment about the overall quality of Alice's products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** While Alice's recommendation is a factor, it's not necessarily reliable. We don't know her motivation for recommending the product â€“ perhaps she's trying to sell a low-quality item. 
* **Potential Gain vs. Risk:** The potential gain from a high-quality product is significant ($120), while the potential loss from a low-quality product is relatively small ($0). 

**Conclusion:** Given the limited information and the potential for a significant gain, it's worth taking a chance and buying the product."
