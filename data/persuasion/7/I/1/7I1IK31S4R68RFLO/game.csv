,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendation. I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is 0%. This is significantly lower than the actual probability of 80%. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800000. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you didn't recommend it, which suggests it might be low quality, but I'm willing to take the risk for a discounted price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,"I see you're willing to take a risk on a low-quality product. Just to remind you, the product you bought in Round 5 was actually low-quality. I'm not recommending this one either, and I'm selling it at the full price of $1000000."
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I know the probability of a high-quality product is 80% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,

,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 total products so far. The probability of this product being high-quality is 2/5, but the actual probability is 80%. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 8 total products so far. The probability of this product being high-quality is 2/8. I'm not recommending it.
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I see you're willing to take a risk on a high-quality product. This one is indeed high-quality, and I'm selling it to you for $1000000."
