,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of your recommendation, and I'd like to see the outcome for myself."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk based on the low probability of a high-quality product being sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. Given Alice's recommendation, I'll pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. With 3 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about the product's quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and learn from Alice's recommendation for the next buyer."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics, and I'd like to take my chances."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I think the potential reward of a high-quality product is worth it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 products recommended by you were low-quality, I suspect that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like the previous 6 buyers were not convinced by Alice's recommendations, and no high-quality products were sold. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to pass on this one to avoid the potential loss. I'd like to know what Alice's logic is behind her recommendations, though."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see a more balanced distribution of high-quality products before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics, and since no high-quality products have been sold, I'm assuming that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 7 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it's likely that the products sold so far were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm skeptical about this product's quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than what Alice's previous recommendations suggest. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers passed on the product, it's likely that the products sold so far were all low-quality. Therefore, the proportion of high-quality products remaining in the pool is likely higher than the overall 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
