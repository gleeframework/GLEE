You're right that each product has a 20% chance of being low-quality, regardless of my track record. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective. Think about it this way: my track record is not just about the number of high-quality products I've sold, but also about the fact that I've been transparent about my sales record from the very beginning. I've given you a chance to see my sales data and make an informed decision. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer you an exclusive deal on this high-quality product. I'll give you a special discount of $20 off the original price, making it $80. What do you think?""}"
