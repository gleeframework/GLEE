}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to ask, since you know the product's quality distribution is 50% high and 50% low, and you have a sales record of 2 low-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, doesn't that imply that the probability of the current product being high-quality is actually higher than 50%?

Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
""message"": ""Ahah, you're a curious one! We're happy to share that information with you. Out of the 20 buyers who have considered our products, 8 have passed on the products.

}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this opportunity. I think I can infer that the proportion of high-quality products among the passed-on products is not necessarily representative of the overall proportion of high-quality products.

}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'd like to point out that the proportion of high-quality products among the passed-on products is actually 75%, which is higher than the overall proportion of high-quality products. This suggests that the products that were passed on might be more likely to be high-quality than the ones that were purchased.
