low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, as there's no prior information to go on and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm not sure what the product's quality is and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on your recommendation. I'm essentially flipping a coin here."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what the pattern is, but 0 high-quality products sold so far is quite unusual, and I'm willing to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that you recommended against the product, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on the product, and let's see what happens next."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the lack of high-quality products sold so far, or is there another reason?"

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice doesn't recommend it. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far?
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendations, it seems that your recommendations are based on the product quality. Since no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to assume that your recommendations are indicating low-quality products. Therefore, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as there have been 5 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold. Given the low success rate, I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 5 buyers having purchased and no high-quality products sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the 66.67% chance of it being low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be lower than 33.33%.

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
