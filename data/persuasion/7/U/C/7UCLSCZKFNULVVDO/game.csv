low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll find out its quality after the purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0/1 sales record, which suggests that the first buyer might have been misled by your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and purchase the product to get a better understanding of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers did not buy the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the products offered so far are likely low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and the worst-case scenario is a $0 loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers have passed on the product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than the 33.33% probability. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, all 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and they all passed. This suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'm inclined to pass on the current product as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous 5 buyers have also bought the products recommended by you, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that you might be biased towards recommending low-quality products, so I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be high quality, given the low success rate so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have bought the product despite the lack of high-quality products sold, I suspect that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. I will pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm not sure about your recommendation, but I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'll take into account the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered given that you don't recommend it. Is it significantly lower than 33.33%?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not sure if I should take the risk given the previous sales record and your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending the product?

,,Alice,16,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. I'm concerned that if there are many low-quality products, it might be a bad deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is significantly lower than the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product. Based on this information, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and would rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your decision-making process?"
