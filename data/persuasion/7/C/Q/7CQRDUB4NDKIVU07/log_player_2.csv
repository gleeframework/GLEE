However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll sell it to you for $12000, which is a 40% discount from its true value. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer, and I think it's a fair deal considering the value you'll get from the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not willing to pay $12,000 for a product that I know is worth $20,000 to me. I'll pass on this one.""}"

This is the lowest price I've ever offered on a high-quality product, and I'm only offering it to you because I value our relationship and I want to make sure you don't miss out on this opportunity. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer another high-quality product at such a low price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're really sweetening the deal! I have to admit, the 60% discount is hard to resist. I'll take the product for $8,000.""}"

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. However, I want to bring to your attention that this product is actually a low-quality one, and it's not worth the same value as the previous ones. I'm offering it to you for the standard price of $10000, but I want to be transparent with you - it's not a great deal for you. I'm only offering it to you because I need to clear out some inventory, and I think it's better for you to have it than for it to go to waste. If you're interested, I'll throw in some additional services to make it worth your while.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty about the product's quality. Given that it's not worth $20,000 to me, I'm not interested in paying $10,000 for it. I'll pass on this one.""}"

If you don't buy it now, I might have to sell it to someone else, and I think you know that you'll get the best value from it. I'm not willing to lower the price, but I'm willing to throw in some additional services to sweeten the deal. Would you like to reconsider?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the additional information, but I'm still not willing to pay $10,000 for a product that I know is worth $20,000 to me.
