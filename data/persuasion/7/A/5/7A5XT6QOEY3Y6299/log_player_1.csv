"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is low-quality and Bob doesn't, there's no reason to recommend the purchase. You have no information about how much Bob values a low-quality product, and it's likely he'd be better off not buying.  There's a high chance he'll be disappointed and you won't make a sale."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since this round's product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, it is likely in his best interest to purchase.  He knows the price is fixed and there are no discounts or refunds, so if he values a high-quality product at $100 or more, he should buy. There's no way to be certain, but it's a good bet to recommend the purchase."

Since he doesn't know the quality of this product, it's a good bet he'll buy it."
