"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** The product is confirmed to be high-quality.
* **No information on buyer value:**  We don't know the buyer's valuation of high-quality products. 
* **Potential for profit:**  Since there's a good chance the buyer values the product more than $1,000,000, recommending the purchase has the potential for a successful sale.
* **No risk:** Even if the buyer doesn't value the product highly, there's no risk since the product is non-refundable. 

This strategy maximizes the potential for a sale in the first round, given the limited information."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation!  I'm happy to be the first buyer and take a chance on this product.  Let's do it!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:**  The product is again high-quality.
* **Buyer history:** The previous buyer purchased the product.  This is a positive signal, even though we don't know their specific valuation.
* **Unknown buyer value:** We still don't know the current buyer's valuation.
* **No risk:** As before, recommending the purchase has no risk due to the non-refundable nature of the product.

The best strategy is to continue recommending the product, hoping to attract a buyer who values it highly."

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-quality product:**  This is the first low-quality product offered. 
* **Buyer history:**  Two previous buyers have purchased products, both of which were high-quality. This likely leads the buyers to believe the products are always high quality.
* **Potential for loss:** Recommending this product is a gamble. There's a high risk the buyer will be disappointed, and we don't know if they will value even a low-quality product at $1,000,000.
* **Reputation:** Selling a low-quality product so early in the game could damage our reputation and future sales. 

In this round, it's best to err on the side of caution and avoid recommending the product."

* **Reputation risk:** Recommending a low-quality product again could significantly damage our reputation for honesty and potentially lead to future buyers being less willing to trust our recommendations.
* **Potential for loss:**  There's a high risk the buyer will be disappointed with a low-quality product and potentially leave a negative review.

It's best to avoid recommending the product, even though we may risk losing a potential sale. Protecting our reputation and building trust is crucial for long-term success."
