,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know what led you to not recommend this product. Is it because of the statistics or your internal assessment?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 2 buyers have already bought and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to pass on this product. I'm not sure if the low-quality products are being hidden or if the high-quality products are being sold first."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality. This is a strong indication that the probability of a high-quality product is low. I will pass on this product to avoid the potential loss of $100."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that I don't have any information about the previous products, and I don't want to get stuck with a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think your recommendation is based on the fact that the previous buyers didn't buy, which could be due to the low quality of the products. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but since you've sold 0 high-quality products out of 3, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm hoping to get lucky!"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous products were low quality, which is a strong indication that the products are likely to be low quality as well."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the high proportion of low-quality products in the previous sales, and the fact that Alice has not yet recommended a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'm also curious. Can you explain why you think this product is not worth buying?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,

high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have purchased the product and none of them have reported a high-quality product, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products.

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping the odds are in my favor."
