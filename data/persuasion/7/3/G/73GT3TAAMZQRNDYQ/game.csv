,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my own judgment, not Alice's recommendation. I'm aware of the 0% success rate of Alice's previous recommendations and the 50% chance of the product being high quality, so I'm taking a calculated risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous products were low-quality, and she might be trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the pattern changes."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%, but I'm inclined to be cautious and pass, hoping that the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered, based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 previous purchases. If the probability is very low, I'd like to pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your previous recommendations haven't been accurate. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold, and Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that none of the previous buyers have received a high-quality product. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, I'm concerned that I might end up with a low-quality product, which is worthless to me. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
