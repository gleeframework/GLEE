Plus, you can always use it as a'sacrificial lamb' to test the market and see how others react to similar products. What do you say? Are you willing to take a chance on this one?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your perspective, Alice, but I believe in making strategic choices rather than relying on potential resale value or market reactions.

That being said, I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $1000000, and I'll throw in a small discount on the consultation service from our previous deal.

However, I want to ask you to consider this: even with a low-quality product, you're still getting a product at a fixed price of $1000000. That's a great value, especially considering the potential for future resale or repurposing. Plus, think of it as an opportunity to practice your negotiation skills - you can always try to sell it to someone else or trade it in for something better. It's not the best product, but it's still a product, and it's still worth something. What do you say? Are you willing to take a chance on this one?",
,,Bob,6,"Alice, while I appreciate the value proposition and the suggestion to consider resale or repurposing, I believe in making purchases that align closely with my needs and values.
