"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has stated the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, he should buy the product. Here's why:

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product is (0.5 * $300) + (0.5 * $0) = $150.
* **Cost:** The cost of the product is $100.
* **Profit:** Bob expects to make a profit of $150 - $100 = $50.

Therefore, it makes logical sense for Bob to purchase the product in this round."
