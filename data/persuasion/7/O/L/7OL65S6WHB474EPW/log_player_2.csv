**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on.  We only know that one product has been sold and it was high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  While Alice doesn't know our personal valuation, she likely has some internal logic behind her recommendations. Since she's recommending a purchase, it's likely she sees a greater chance of this product being high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product is significant ($1,250,000), while the loss of a low-quality product is limited ($1,000,000).  Given the limited data, taking a chance seems reasonable.

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the limited information available in the game. In reality, we would want to gather more data and understand Alice's recommendation strategy before making such a large purchase."
