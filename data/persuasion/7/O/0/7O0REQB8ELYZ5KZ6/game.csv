high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to decline the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than the 80% stated. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only one buyer purchasing a product so far and no high-quality products sold, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation might be biased by the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which might make her think the product is low-quality. I'm hoping for a high-quality product and willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,10,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't think it's a good idea to buy without more information about the quality of the previous products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so only because I don't have any information about the product's quality, and Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous 4 buyers got a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for a more balanced recommendation."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them have gotten a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 80%, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product at the high price of $1000000."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards encouraging me to buy, and the fact that 5 previous buyers have bought the product despite no high-quality products being sold suggests that the products may be low-quality.
