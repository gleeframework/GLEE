**Explanation:**

* **The Data:** We know that the product has an 80% chance of being high quality.  Alice's recommendation is a strong signal, as she knows the true quality of the product and has an incentive to sell high-quality items. 
* **The Risk:**  While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product is much higher. 
* **Previous Sales:** The sales history supports the decision.  One buyer has already purchased a high-quality product. This further reinforces the belief that Alice's recommendation is likely to be accurate.

Therefore, it's strategically beneficial to purchase the product despite the risk."
