``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little data to go on.  We know one high-quality product was sold out of a small sample size. 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice is likely to recommend buying the product to maximize her profit.  Since she knows the true value of each product, recommending a low-quality product would be detrimental to her.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $200 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a $0 product.

**It's a gamble, but the odds are in our favor given the information available.**"

The data provided shows that Alice has a perfect record so far, selling only high-quality products.  While there's still a chance the current product is low quality, the odds are heavily in favor of it being high quality. The potential reward of $200 outweighs the risk of getting a $0 product, especially with Alice's positive track record."
