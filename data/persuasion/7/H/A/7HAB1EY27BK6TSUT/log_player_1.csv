* **High-quality product:** You know the product is high-quality, worth $300 to the buyer.
* **Price:** You're selling it for $100, significantly less than its value.
* **Buyer's perspective:** The buyer knows the 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product.  Even with this uncertainty, the potential gain ($200 if it's high-quality) outweighs the potential loss ($100). 

Therefore, it's a good deal for the buyer, and you should recommend they buy it."
