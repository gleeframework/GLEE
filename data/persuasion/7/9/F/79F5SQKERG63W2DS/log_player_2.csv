"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a product to sell you for $1000000. I'm offering it to you at a price that is significantly higher than its actual value. I'm doing this because I'm trying to gauge your willingness to pay. Please consider the offer, but keep in mind that this is just a test. If you're interested, I'll be happy to discuss further.

If you're willing to commit to buying at least one product from me at the end of the 20 rounds, I'll offer you a 50% discount on that product. This way, you'll have a chance to get a better deal on a product that you might be interested in. What do you think?

The catch is that you'll have to pay the full price of $1000000 for the current product, but if you win the lottery, you'll get the second product for free. What do you think?
