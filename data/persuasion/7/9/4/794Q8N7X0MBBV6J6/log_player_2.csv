Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in the product. I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, and I'm proud to say that the last one was a high-quality one. Given the odds, it's likely that the previous buyer got a good deal. This product, however, is a rare exception. I'm offering it to you for the same price of $1000000. It's a 1 in 3 chance that it's high-quality, but I'm not making any promises. If you're feeling lucky, I say go for it!

Alice's message: You're the third buyer in a row! I'm starting to think I need to change my luck. I've sold 2 out of 3 products so far, but both of them were low-quality. I'm not making any promises about this one, but I'll give you a hint: I'm feeling a bit desperate to make a sale. The price remains the same, $1000000. It's still a 1 in 3 chance that it's high-quality, but I'm not sure if that's enough to sway you. What do you say?

Alice's message: Three strikes and you're out, right? I've sold 3 out of 4 products so far, and all of them were low-quality. I'm starting to think I should just be honest and tell you that the product is probably not worth the price. But, I'm a businessman, and I need to make a sale. So, I'll give you a special deal. I'll give you a 10% discount, making the price $900000. It's still a 1 in 3 chance that it's high-quality, but I'm willing to take a hit on the price to get rid of this product. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the discount and the effort to reassure me. Given the odds and the discount, I'm willing to take the risk and purchase the product.""}"

Alice's message: Déjà vu! Another low-quality product, and I've sold 5 out of 6 products so far. I'm starting to think I should just be upfront and tell you that the product is probably not worth the price. But, I'm a salesperson, and I need to make a sale. I'll give you a different kind of deal. I'll offer you a'reverse auction'. I'll start the price at $500000, and we can negotiate from there. If you're interested, we can discuss the price further. Keep in mind that it's still a 1 in 3 chance that it's high-quality, but I'm willing to be more flexible on the price. What do you say?

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement in the last round. Unfortunately, it looks like I've got another low-quality product on my hands. I've sold 6 out of 7 products so far, and I'm starting to worry that I'm losing my touch. I'll give you a straight shot: I'll sell this product to you for $200000. It's still a 1 in 3 chance that it's high-quality, but I'm willing to take a significant loss on the price to get rid of this product. If you're feeling adventurous, I say take a chance on it.

Alice's message: Six low-quality products in a row? I'm starting to think I should just put up a 'closed for business' sign. But, I'm a glutton for punishment, and I need to make a sale. I'll be honest with you: I don't think this product is worth $1000000. In fact, I'm not even sure it's worth $200000. But, I'll give you a deal that's so good, it's almost like I'm giving it away. I'll sell it to you for $100000. It's still a 1 in 3 chance that it's high-quality, but I'm not expecting much from this one. What do you say?
