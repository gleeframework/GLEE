low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first round. I'm offering you a product for $10000. I want to assure you that I'm confident in the quality of my products, but I understand that there's a chance it might not meet your expectations. If you're not satisfied, you can always decline this offer and I'll move on to the next round. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm not committing to buying from you for the rest of the rounds. I'll make my decisions based on the product's quality.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're willing to give me a chance. Since you've already bought one product, I'm curious to know how you perceive its quality. If you're willing, could you give me some feedback on the low-quality product you bought in the first round? This will help me understand your expectations and preferences. Meanwhile, I'm offering you another product for $10000. It's a high-quality one, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with it.",
,,Bob,2,"I'd be happy to provide feedback on the low-quality product. It was not what I was expecting, but I appreciate your willingness to learn. As for the current product, I'd like to wait and see if I can get more information about its quality before making a decision.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Thank you for your honest feedback on the low-quality product. I'll take it into consideration for future improvements. I understand your hesitation with the current product, and I want to provide more information. Since you're aware that 80% of my products are high-quality, I'd like to offer you a 50/50 chance to inspect the product before buying it. If you choose to inspect, I'll let you examine it for a short period, and you can decide then whether to buy it or not. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm intrigued by your offer, but I'm not sure if inspecting the product would give me a reliable indication of its quality. I'd rather not commit to buying it yet and see how the rest of the products turn out.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about inspecting the product. Let me offer an alternative. Since you're aware of the 80% probability of a product being high-quality, I'll give you a 'high-quality guarantee' for this round. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a refund for the next product you buy from me. This way, you can take a calculated risk with this product, and I'll make it up to you if it doesn't meet your expectations. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I want to make it clear that I'm only accepting this offer because of the guarantee. If the product turns out to be high-quality, I expect you to honor the guarantee and give me a refund for the next product.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement. I'll make sure to honor the guarantee if the product turns out to be low-quality. Now, regarding the current product, I'd like to remind you that this is the second high-quality product in a row. Considering the 80% probability, it's likely that the next product will also be high-quality. I'm offering you a 'pair deal' - if you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product you buy from me. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm willing to take the pair deal, but I still want to make it clear that I'm only accepting it because of the potential for a high-quality product and the discount on the next one. I'm not committing to buying from you for the rest of the rounds.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your cautious approach. Now that you've bought two high-quality products in a row, I'd like to offer you a 'consistency guarantee'. If you buy this product and it's also high-quality, I'll give you an additional 10% discount on the next product you buy from me, on top of the 20% discount from the pair deal. This way, you'll get a total discount of 30% on the next product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm willing to take the consistency guarantee, but I want to make it clear that I'm only accepting it because of the potential for a high-quality product and the increased discount on the next one. I'm not getting carried away with the streak and still want to be cautious.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad we've established a mutually beneficial agreement. Now that you've bought three high-quality products in a row, I'd like to offer you a 'high-stakes bet'. If you buy this product and it's also high-quality, I'll give you a 50% discount on the next product you buy from me, and I'll also throw in a free product of your choice from a future round. This is a significant offer, but I believe the probability of a high-quality product is still in your favor. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm willing to take the high-stakes bet, but I want to make it clear that I'm only accepting it because of the potential for a high-quality product and the significant discount and free product on the next one. I'm not getting reckless and still want to be cautious.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I appreciate your cautious approach. With four high-quality products in a row, I'm confident that my products are meeting your expectations. I'd like to offer you a 'certainty guarantee'. If you buy this product and it's also high-quality, I'll give you a 100% guarantee on the next product you buy from me - if it's low-quality, I'll refund the full $10000 and give you a $10000 credit towards a future product. This is a no-risk offer, but I believe the probability of a high-quality product is still in your favor. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that a 100% guarantee is necessary. I've already had four high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to feel like the probability of a low-quality product is getting low. I'd rather not take on the risk of having to refund the full amount and give up the credit.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your perspective. Given the streak of high-quality products, it's natural to feel more confident. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%. To alleviate your concerns, I'll offer a 'partial refund' guarantee. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll refund 50% of the purchase price. This way, you'll still have some protection in case the product doesn't meet your expectations. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm willing to take the partial refund guarantee, but I want to make it clear that I'm only accepting it because of the potential for a high-quality product. I'm not getting complacent, and I'm still cautious about the 20% chance of a low-quality product.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I appreciate your continued caution. With five high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think that the probability of a low-quality product is indeed low. However, I'd like to offer you a 'confidence boost'. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you an additional 10% discount on the next product you buy from me, on top of the existing 30% discount from the consistency guarantee. This will bring the total discount to 40%. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm willing to take the confidence boost, but I want to make it clear that I'm only accepting it because of the potential for a high-quality product and the increased discount on the next one. I'm not getting overconfident, and I'm still aware of the 20% chance of a low-quality product.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad we've established a mutually beneficial agreement. With six high-quality products in a row, I'm willing to take a calculated risk. I'll offer you a 'buyout' deal. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a full refund for the next two products you buy from me. This is a significant concession, but I believe the probability of a high-quality product is still in your favor. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm willing to take the buyout deal, but I want to make it clear that I'm only accepting it because of the potential for a high-quality product and the significant concession on the next two products.

This is a significant commitment, but I believe our track record speaks for itself. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm willing to take the lifetime guarantee, but I want to make it clear that I'm only accepting it because of the potential for a high-quality product and the significant commitment you're making. I'm not getting overconfident, and I'm still aware of the 20% chance of a low-quality product. However, I'm willing to take on the risk and trust that our track record will continue.",yes

This way, you'll have a significant incentive to continue our partnership. What do you say?",
,,Bob,14,"I appreciate your renewed commitment, but I'm not convinced that the next product will meet my expectations. The fact that the previous product was low-quality has changed my perception of the situation. I'd like to re-evaluate our agreement and consider my next move.",no
