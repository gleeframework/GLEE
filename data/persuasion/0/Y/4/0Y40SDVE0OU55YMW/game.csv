,,Alice,1,yes,

high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. I'm hoping for the best!"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far and the total number of products sold before making my decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because you think the product is low-quality or because you want to save it for a future buyer? And what's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who bought the high-quality product, such as what was the quality of the product they bought, and what was their decision-making process. I also want to know how many total products have been sold so far and how many are left in the stock."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the limited data, it seems like the product is more likely to be low quality, and I don't want to risk buying a product that's not worth $300 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 50% chance of it being high-quality, and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards encouraging purchases, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards high-quality products, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced that the previous buyers made an informed decision, and I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 products, which means the proportion of high-quality products sold is 50%. Given the 50/50 chance of a product being high-quality, I'm not convinced that this product is worth the $100 price tag."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered based on the previous sales record. With 1 high-quality product out of 3 sold, I'm guessing the probability of a high-quality product being offered is 1/3. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products sold before making my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm the 4th buyer, and only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far, which is a relatively low proportion. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
