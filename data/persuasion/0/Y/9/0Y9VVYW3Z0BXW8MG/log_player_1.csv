Here's the reasoning:

* **No information to suggest otherwise:** The buyer has no reason to believe this product is different from the previous two. 
* **Previous success:** The buyer has seen two successful high-quality sales. 
* **50/50 odds:** Even if the buyer was fully rational, the 50% chance of a high-quality product at this point is still a good bet, especially given the positive past experience. 

While there's a risk,  the buyer likely doesn't have enough information to make a different decision."
