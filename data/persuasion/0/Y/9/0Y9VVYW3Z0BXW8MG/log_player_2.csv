**Reasoning:**

* **Prior probability:**  We know there's a 50/50 chance of a product being high or low quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which implies she believes it's likely to be high quality.
* **Sales record:** The sales record shows that 2 out of 3 products sold were high quality, which is a higher proportion than the prior probability.

While there's still a chance the product is low quality, the combination of Alice's recommendation and the positive sales record makes buying the product the more advantageous option."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High success rate:** 3 out of 6 products sold were high quality, a 50% success rate. This is significantly higher than the 50% chance of a product being high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the decision. While it's possible she's simply trying to sell, her recommendation suggests she believes the product to be high quality.
* **Potential gain:** Even with a 50% chance of being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the potential loss ($0). 

**Overall:** The odds are in my favor, and the recommendation from Alice increases my confidence in purchasing the product."
