high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous buyer's purchase might be a result of Alice's recommendation rather than the product's actual quality, and I don't want to be the one to pay $100 for a potentially low-quality product.

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous two products were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 33.33%.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'm not confident that this product is worth $100 to me, especially considering the low probability of it being high-quality."
