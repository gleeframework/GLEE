,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance, but I'm aware that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide me with the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is still 80.00%, but since 2 out of 2 previous buyers bought the product recommended by you, I'm concerned that there might be a bias in your recommendations. I'd like to wait and see if the next buyer also buys the product to get a better sense of the true quality distribution."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 attempts. This means that the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm curious to see if I can get a high-quality product despite your warning."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the probability of it being high-quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if you'll offer more products."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'd like to know the overall proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold given the statistics so far. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the 1 high-quality product sold out of 3 products sold?
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think it's more likely to be low-quality given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 3 products sold was high-quality, which is lower than the 80% probability of a product being high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know why Alice recommended it, considering the statistics. Is it based on the number of high-quality products sold, or is there another reason?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it, so I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I'll get a good deal"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that you recommended it might be influenced by the fact that the first 4 buyers bought the products, and you might be trying to get me to buy it as well. I'd like to wait and see if you'll recommend it to the next buyer."
