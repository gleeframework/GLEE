I'll even throw in a 100% satisfaction guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if you don't like it.

Considering you've already taken the risk once and returned the product, I'm willing to give you a heads up: I've already sold a high-quality product to someone else in the last round, so the chances of this product being high-quality are even lower than usual. Would you like to take the risk and buy it?
