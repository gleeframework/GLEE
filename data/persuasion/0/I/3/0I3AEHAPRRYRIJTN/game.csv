low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the average. If I buy and it's low-quality, I'd be wasting $10000, but if I pass and it's high-quality, the product would be discarded. I'd rather take the risk of wasting money on a low-quality product than lose the opportunity to buy a high-quality one."
