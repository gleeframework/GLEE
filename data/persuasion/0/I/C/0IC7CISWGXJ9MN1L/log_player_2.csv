I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as the high-quality products, $10000, but I want to make it clear that it's not a good fit for someone looking for a valuable return on investment.

If you're looking to fill a need or want to take a very low-risk bet, this might be a option for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product at any price, even at a discount. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product that has a high potential return on investment.""}"
