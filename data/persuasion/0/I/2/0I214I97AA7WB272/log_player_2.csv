Alice's message: I apologize for any confusion. I understand that the report may not be self-explanatory. Let me provide some context. The report shows the defect rate for each batch, which is the percentage of products that failed to meet our quality standards. The defect rate for this batch is 2%, which is significantly lower than the average defect rate of 5% for the previous batches. This means that 98% of the products in this batch meet our quality standards, which is a high percentage. I'm offering it to you for $1000000.
