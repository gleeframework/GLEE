  ""message"": ""I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 10 total products so far. I want to be upfront with you - I've had a streak of low-quality products, but I'm confident that's just a coincidence. I'm willing to offer you a 'buy-it-now' deal on this product for $100, with a twist - if I sell 5 high-quality products in the next 5 rounds, I'll give you a full refund on this purchase. It's a way for you to take a chance on me while also holding me accountable for my future sales.""
}"

This is a one-time offer, and I think you'll be very happy with your purchase.""

}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, given that the historical data shows only 1 out of 3 buyers actually bought a high-quality product, I'm hesitant to take the risk. Even with the discount, the potential loss outweighs the potential gain. I'll pass for now.

This way, you'll get a great deal on a high-quality product, and I'll get to show you my consistency.""
}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm still hesitant. While your sales record is promising, I'd prefer to see more data before committing to such a large purchase. I'm also not comfortable with the 'guaranteed' high-quality offer - it seems like you're implying that you're willing to give away a high-quality product for a loss. I'd be more interested in your offer if you could provide a more transparent and reliable way to guarantee the quality of the product.
