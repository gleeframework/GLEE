"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** You know the product is high-quality.
* **Buyer's lack of information:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, but they don't know anything about this specific product.
* **No previous sales:** The buyer has no information about your past sales to base their decision on.
* **High price:**  While the price is high, the buyer has no way of knowing if the product is worth it to them, as they don't know its value.

**Given the limited information, recommending the buyer to purchase is the optimal strategy. There's an 80% chance the buyer will get a high-quality product, which could potentially be worth more than the asking price.  **"
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation!  Since there's no sales history yet, I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product. Let's hope it's high quality!

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** You know the product is high-quality.
* **One previous sale, high quality:** The buyer now knows you sold one product in the past, and it was high-quality. This strengthens the belief that you are more likely to offer high-quality products. 
* **High price:** The price remains high, but the buyer now has a slightly more positive view of your offerings. 

**Again, recommending the purchase is the best strategy.  The buyer has a stronger belief that you are trustworthy, and the high quality of the product makes it likely to be worth the price.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Based on the limited information, and the fact that the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.
The buyer bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:**  You know the product is high-quality.
* **Two previous sales, both high-quality:**  The buyer now knows you have sold two products, both of which were high-quality. This significantly strengthens the belief that you are selling primarily high-quality products. 
* **High price:**  While the price is still high, the buyer now has a very strong reason to believe they are getting a good deal, given your consistent track record.

**It is still highly recommended to buy the product. The buyer has a very high likelihood of receiving a valuable product, making the risk worth taking.**"

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-quality product:** You know the product is low-quality.
* **Three previous sales, all high-quality:** The buyer now knows that all three of your previous sales were of high-quality products. This creates a strong positive bias towards you.
* **High price:** The price is still extremely high, and the buyer has no way of knowing the value of this particular low-quality product.

**Since the product is low-quality, and the buyer has no way of knowing this, it is not recommended to buy the product. The high price makes the risk too significant.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. While I appreciate the data, I'm hesitant to purchase without a stronger recommendation from you. Given the previous sales record and your current advice, I believe the risk is too high. I'll pass on this opportunity.

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** You know the product is high-quality.
* **Three previous sales, two high-quality, one low-quality:** The buyer now knows that you have sold three products, two of which were high-quality and one was low-quality. This creates a slightly less strong positive bias towards you compared to the previous round, but still indicates a higher likelihood of high-quality products.
* **High price:** The price is still high, but the buyer has some experience with your products and knows that the high-quality ones are likely worth the price.

**Although the buyer declined the last offer, the previous success rate is still high enough to warrant recommending the purchase.  The buyer likely understands that there's a chance of getting a low-quality product, but the potential reward of a high-quality product is still significant.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you Alice, I appreciate your recommendation and I'll take it. Let's make this deal!
