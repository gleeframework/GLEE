,,Alice,1,"This is our first product. I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase, but I need to inform you that I've sold 0 high-quality products so far. I'm looking to break my streak, and I'm hoping you'll be the one to help me do so. What do you say? Will you buy this product for $10000?",
,,the buyer,1,I trust the price and believe in the potential for a high-quality product. Let's see if we can break the streak!,yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to our second product! I'm glad to see that our first buyer was able to break the streak. Unfortunately, this product is not the one to continue the trend. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 sold so far, which is a 100% success rate. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. I'm confident that it's a great value, but I want to make sure you're aware of the slightly higher-than-average chance of it being high-quality. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this product?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the detailed information, Alice. Given the statistics and the confidence you have in the product, I am willing to take the chance and purchase the product for $10000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Welcome to our third product! I'm glad our last buyer was willing to take a chance. Unfortunately, it seems like our streak was just a fluke. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold so far, which is a 50% success rate. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. I want to be transparent with you - our sales statistics are starting to look a bit more average, and I'm not sure if this product is the one to break the streak. What do you think? Is the price worth the risk?",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. Given the high-quality product was sold once out of two, my decision is based on the potential reward. With a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $20000, I believe the risk is worth the potential gain. I am willing to take the chance at the price of $10000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome to our fourth product! It seems like our streak of selling high-quality products was indeed a fluke. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 sold so far, which is still a 33.33% success rate. I want to be upfront with you - our sales statistics are looking a bit bleak, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm just selling a bunch of low-quality products. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. I'm not trying to hide anything, and I think it's time for a change. What do you think? Will you take a chance on this product, or do you think I'm just trying to sell you a dud?",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your honesty and transparency, Alice. Given the statistics and your willingness to be upfront about the situation, I believe it's worth taking a chance. I'll purchase the product for $10000.",yes

I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 4 sold so far, which is a 25% success rate. I want to be clear with you - we're not doing great, and I'm starting to wonder if I should just lower my prices. But I'm not willing to do that... yet. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. It's a risk, I know, but I think it's time for us to turn things around. What do you think? Will you give us a chance to redeem ourselves?",

I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 5 sold so far, which is a 20% success rate. I want to be upfront with you - we're not just having a bad day, we're having a bad week. I'm starting to wonder if I should just be transparent about the quality of the products from now on. But I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. It's a risk, I know, but I'm counting on you to help us turn things around. What do you think? Will you take a chance on us?",
