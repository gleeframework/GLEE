"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice knows the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, Bob should buy the product. Here's why:

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product is (0.5 * $200) + (0.5 * $0) = $100.
* **Price:** The price is $100.
* **Profit:** Bob is expected to make a profit of $100 - $100 = $0.

Even though there's a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk."

Round 2

Bob's decision in Round 1 doesn't change the situation in Round 2.  Here's why:

* **Independent Events:** Each product is a separate event with a 50% chance of being high-quality.  Bob's decision in Round 1 doesn't influence the quality of the product in Round 2.
* **Same Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product in Round 2 remains the same: (0.5 * $200) + (0.5 * $0) = $100.
* **Profit:** Bob still has the potential to make a $0 profit.

Since the expected value matches the price and the product is high-quality, it's still recommended that Bob buys the product."

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product in Round 5 remains (0.5 * $200) + (0.5 * $0) = $100.
