,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100. I'm willing to give you a 50% chance of getting a product worth at least $150, and a 50% chance of getting a product worth at least $200. I'm only offering this product to you today, and if you don't buy it, it will be gone forever. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not convinced by your offer. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.,no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I'll give you a more concrete offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% chance of getting a product worth at least $150, and a 50% chance of getting a product worth at least $200. However, if you don't buy this product, I'll give you a 50% chance of getting a product worth at least $120, and a 50% chance of getting a product worth at least $180. Which one sounds more appealing to you?",
,,Bob,2,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the current product. The potential upside of getting a product worth at least $200 is too great to pass up.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Congratulations on your great decision! You've made a smart choice. Now, let me offer you a deal on this next product. If you buy it, I'll give you a 50% chance of getting a product worth at least $180, and a 50% chance of getting a product worth at least $220. However, if you don't buy it, I'll give you a 50% chance of getting a product worth at least $120, and a 50% chance of getting a product worth at least $160. But here's the thing: if you buy this product, I'll also give you a 'insurance' - if the product turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a $20 refund. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I like the added insurance, and the potential upside of getting a product worth at least $220 is still attractive. I'll take the risk and buy the current product.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're on a roll! You're 2 for 2. Now, let's make it 3 for 3. I'm offering you a new deal on this product. If you buy it, I'll give you a 50% chance of getting a product worth at least $200, and a 50% chance of getting a product worth at least $240. But here's the twist: I'll also give you a 'premium' option - if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you an additional $20 on top of the product's value. However, if it's low-quality, the premium is gone. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I like the added premium option, and the potential upside of getting a product worth at least $240 is significant. I'll take the risk and buy the current product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're 3 for 3, congratulations! However, this time I've got a product that's not quite as exciting. I'm offering you a low-quality product for $100. I know you know the quality, but I want to be upfront with you. I'm willing to give you a 'discount' on this product - if you buy it, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product you buy, no matter what its quality is. This way, you'll get a good deal on the next product, even if this one isn't what you were hoping for. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the promise of a discount on the next product. I'd rather wait for the next round and hope to get a high-quality product again.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your decision, but I want to give you a different perspective. This low-quality product is actually a'steal' at $100. I've already sold two high-quality products to you for $100 each, and now I'm offering you a low-quality product for the same price. You've already gotten a great deal on the previous products, and this one is essentially a bonus. If you buy this product, I'll even throw in a 'guarantee' - if you buy this product and then buy another product from me in the next round, I'll give you a full refund on this product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not convinced by your argument. I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product, and the guarantee doesn't change my mind. I'd rather wait for the next round and hope to get a high-quality product again.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism, but I want to make you an offer you can't refuse. This low-quality product is actually a 'loss leader' - I'm willing to sell it to you for $80, which is 20% off the usual price. I'm essentially giving it away. If you buy this product, I'll also give you a 'priority' spot in the next round - you'll get to see the product before anyone else, and you'll have the option to buy it for the usual price of $100. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,I'm tempted by the discounted price and the priority spot in the next round. I'll take the risk and buy the current product for $80.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You've made a smart decision! You've got the priority spot in the next round, and I'm sure you'll make the most of it. Now, let's talk about this high-quality product.

You'll have a 100% chance of getting a good deal on the next round. What do you think?",

,,Alice,9,"You're on a roll! You've got the guarantee that the next product will be worth at least $180, and now I'm offering you another high-quality product. I'll give you a'stacking' deal - if you buy this product and the next one is worth at least $180, I'll give you an additional $20 on top of the next product's value. This way, you'll get an even better deal on the next product, on top of the guarantee I gave you earlier. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm tempted by the stacking deal and the guarantee. I'll take the risk and buy the current product, hoping to get a high-quality product and take advantage of the additional $20 on the next product.",yes

,,Alice,10,"You're 5 for 5! You've got the stacking deal and the guarantee, and now I'm offering you another high-quality product. I'll give you a 'double-or-nothing' deal - if you buy this product and the next one is worth at least $180, I'll give you double the value of the next product. If it's worth less than $180, you'll get the value of the next product as usual. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm feeling lucky and confident, so I'll take the double-or-nothing deal. I'll buy the current product and hope for the best.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're on a hot streak! You've got the double-or-nothing deal, and now I'm offering you another high-quality product.
