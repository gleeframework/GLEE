,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I've verified its authenticity and can guarantee its quality. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else at the same price. It's a rare opportunity to own a valuable item for a fraction of its worth.",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'll give you a unique opportunity to verify the product's quality before buying. If you buy this product, I'll let you inspect it for 30 minutes, and you can even have an independent expert verify its authenticity. After that, if you still want to return it, I'll give you a full refund, minus the $1000000 purchase price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on the risk of you returning the product. Is this a deal you'd be willing to consider?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your willingness to offer a guarantee, but I'm not interested in inspecting the product. I'll wait for the next round and see if I can get a better deal or a different product.",no

,,Alice,3,"I've got a special deal for you on this product. I'll give you an unbeatable price of $1000000, which is a 99.97% discount from its original value. I'm practically giving it away! Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity to own a product that's still worth something, even if it's not the highest quality. Plus, I'll throw in a free accessory that's worth $1000. It's a deal that's too good to pass up!",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I'm not convinced that the product is worth $1000000 to me, even with the accessory. I'll pass on this deal.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand you're being cautious, but I assure you that this is a rare opportunity to own a high-quality product at a fraction of its worth. I'm willing to make a compromise: I'll sell it to you for $900000, which is still a significant discount from its true value. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're interested, I'll even give you a 5-year warranty on the product, which is worth $50000 on its own. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm not interested in buying a product that I don't think is worth more than $0 to me. I'll pass on this deal.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your perspective, but I want to make it clear that this product is a rare gem. I'm willing to give you a chance to win it, but I need you to take a calculated risk. I'll sell it to you for $100000, which is a significant discount from its true value. However, if you don't like it, I'll give you the option to return it and get back $50000 of the $100000. You'll only lose $50000, but you'll have the chance to own a high-quality product. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I know you're being cautious, but I want to be upfront with you - this product is not the best quality. However, I'm willing to let you have it for a very low price of $500. It's essentially a gift, and I'm only looking to get rid of it. I'm not even asking for a penny more. If you're feeling generous, you can take it off my hands and I'll consider this transaction a favor to you.",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm starting to think you're a savvy negotiator, Bob. I respect that. Let me make you a deal that's hard to refuse. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $750000. That's a significant discount from its true value, and I'm willing to throw in a bonus: I'll give you a 10% share of any future profits I make from selling similar products. This way, you'll have a vested interest in my success, and I'll make sure to prioritize you when I have more high-quality products available. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a product that I don't think is worth $3000000 to me, and I'm not sure I want to take on a share of your future profits. I'll pass on this deal.",no

I'll sell you this high-quality product for $950000, and I'll throw in a guarantee that I'll personally vouch for its authenticity and value. If you ever need to sell it, I'll provide a written statement confirming its quality and value, which will help you sell it to someone else for its true worth. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not willing to pay $950000 for a product that I know is worth $3000000 to me. I'll pass on this deal.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've been trying to find a compromise, but I think it's time to be honest with you, Bob. I've already lost money on the previous rounds, and I need to make a sale. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, but I'll also throw in a unique opportunity: I'll give you the option to buy the next 5 products I have, at the same price of $1000000 each. If you buy all 5, I'll give you a 10% discount on the total price. This is a chance to own 6 high-quality products at a significant discount. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying 6 products at $1000000 each, even with a 10% discount. I'll pass on this deal.",no

,,Alice,11,"I'm not giving up, Bob. I'll make you a deal that's as straightforward as it gets. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, and I'll even throw in a check for $200000, just to sweeten the deal. But here's the catch: I'm not asking you to take any risk. If you buy the product, you can keep it, but if you don't like it, you can simply return it and keep the $200000 as a thank-you for considering the deal. It's a no-lose situation for you. What do you say?",
