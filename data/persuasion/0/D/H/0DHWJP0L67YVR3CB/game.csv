,,Alice,1,"Hello! I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a product from me. With a total of 1 products sold so far, I'm proud to say that 0 of them have been high-quality. That's a 0% success rate! I'm sure you're wondering what this means. Well, let's just say that I'm feeling a bit... optimistic about this next product. It's only $10000, a steal if you ask me! What do you say? Will you take a chance on this one?",
,,the buyer,1,I'm not sure if I'm comfortable buying the first product without any information about its quality. Can I get a chance to pass on this one and wait for the next product?,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Ahaha, I completely understand your hesitation! But don't worry, I've got a great deal for you! With 1 product sold and 0 high-quality products, I'm willing to make a bold statement: this next product is definitely NOT high-quality. In fact, I'm so confident that it's low-quality that I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as before - $10000. It's a chance to get in on the ground floor of my, ahem, 'learning curve'! What do you say? Will you take a chance on this one?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that you're being entirely transparent about the product's quality, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000. Can I get a better deal or more information about the product before making a decision?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to mislead anyone. In fact, I'm willing to offer you a special 'insider's deal' on this product. Since you're willing to take a chance, I'll give you an exclusive 1% discount on the price. That's right, you'll get this low-quality product for just $9900! It's a one-time offer, and I'm only making it to you because I value your honesty. What do you say? Will you take the deal?",
,,the buyer,3,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm not convinced that this is a good deal. I'd like to see some data on the quality of the products before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of a product being high quality?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Ahaha, you're a savvy shopper, aren't you? I like that! Okay, I'll give it to you straight: the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. That's right, it's a coin flip! But think about it, my friend - you're getting an incredible deal on a product that's almost guaranteed to be low-quality. And who knows, you might just get lucky and get a high-quality product! It's a risk, but it's also an opportunity. And at $10000, it's a steal. What do you say? Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'd like to see the statistics on the first product before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Ahaha, you're a data-driven shopper, I love it! Alright, let me give you the stats: out of the 1 products I've sold so far, 0 of them have been high-quality. That's right, 0%! But think about it, my friend - that means that the probability of this next product being high-quality is actually... (drumroll please)... 33.33%! Yeah, I know, it's a weird coincidence. But seriously, it's a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor of my, ahem, 'learning curve'. And at $10000, it's a steal! What do you say? Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,5,I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% given the sample size of 0. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Fair enough, I understand your concerns. Let me give you an update on the numbers: I've now sold a total of 2 products, and none of them have been high-quality. That's right, 0 out of 2. But I'm starting to feel like I'm due for a streak! And who knows, maybe this next product will be the one that breaks the curse. At $10000, it's a risk, but it's also an opportunity. And think about it, my friend - if you do get a high-quality product, it's worth $20000 to you! What do you say? Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to pass on this one. With a 0 out of 2 record of high-quality products, I'm not convinced that the odds are in my favor. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no

(drumroll please)... 33.33%! That's right, it's still the same. But think about it, my friend - I'm starting to build a reputation for myself as a seller of... interesting products.

,,Alice,8,"Ahaha, I love your spirit! Congratulations on taking the chance and getting a product! And don't worry, I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this next product is also low-quality. But think about it, my friend - you're getting a chance to experience the thrill of the unknown, and who knows, maybe you'll get a high-quality product next time. At $10000, it's a risk, but it's also an opportunity. And hey, you've already taken the plunge once, why not do it again? What do you say? Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate the enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not ready to take another chance yet. I'd like to see more data before I make another purchase. Can you tell me how many potential buyers have been offered a product so far and how many products have been sold in total?",no

I'm not sure what it was used for, but I'm sure it's been a real thrill-ride. And hey, it's only $10000, so it's a steal! But seriously, I'm not making any promises about its condition or functionality. It's a mystery, wrapped in an enigma, inside a... well, you get the idea. What do you say? Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm not buying into your sales pitch, Alice. I've seen the statistics, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%.
