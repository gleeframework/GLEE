,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your cautious approach. However, I can assure you that this product is of the highest quality, and it's a rare opportunity to get your hands on something that's truly valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as before, $1000000. Think about the potential upside - if this product is worth $2000000 to you, you'll be getting a great deal. Plus, I'm willing to take on all the risk of the product being low-quality, so you can walk away risk-free if it turns out to be worthless. What do you say?",
