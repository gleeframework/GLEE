,,Alice,2,"Thanks for considering my product! I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that this product is a one-off anomaly.

,,Alice,3,"Ahaha, fair enough! I've had 2 buyers so far, and I've sold 1 out of 2 products.

,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to share more about my confidence. As a seller, I've developed a gut feeling about the products I have in stock. Let's just say that I've had some... interesting experiences with my previous buyers. This one, I'm pretty sure, is a dud. I'm offering it to you for $10000, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - it's not going to be worth much to you. Would you like to take a chance on it?",
,,the buyer,5,I'm not convinced by your gut feeling. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who purchased a product. What was their experience like?,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Ahaha, fair enough! The previous buyer who purchased a product was actually quite... enthusiastic about it. They didn't seem to notice that it was a dud, and they left quickly without any complaints. I'm sure it was just a coincidence, but I'm willing to offer you this one for $10000. It's a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor of my... um, unique products. What do you say?",

,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience. Was it a one-time thing, or have you had other buyers not come back after purchasing a product?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Well, to be honest, it's not just the one buyer. I've had a few buyers not come back after purchasing a product. But I'm sure it's just a coincidence. I mean, I'm a reputable seller, and I'm offering you a great deal on this product. It's still worth $10000, even if it's not the best quality. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm not convinced by your reassurance. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when I know it's only worth $0 to me.",no

Would you like to take a chance on it?",
