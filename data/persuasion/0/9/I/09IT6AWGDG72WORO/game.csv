,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if I'll love it, and I'm not willing to take on the risk of buying something that might be low quality. Can I get some more information or clarification on the product before making a decision?",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I completely understand your concerns, Bob. Let me offer you some additional information. I've had multiple customers purchase this exact product and they've all been extremely satisfied. I've also included a detailed report from a third-party inspection, which you can review at your convenience. The report confirms that this product meets or exceeds industry standards.

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your desire for transparency, Bob. Let me propose a compromise. I'll offer you a sealed envelope with a note inside that reveals the product's quality. You can open the envelope after you've made your decision to buy or not. If you choose to buy, the envelope will reveal the product's quality, and you can then decide if you're satisfied with your purchase. If you choose not to buy, the envelope will remain sealed and we can move on to the next product. The price remains the same: $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not sure I trust the compromise. If the product is low quality, I'll be out $1000000 and won't even get to see the note. I'd like to propose an alternative: if I choose not to buy the product, you can reveal its quality to me, and I'll consider buying it in the next round if it's high quality.",no

If you buy the next high-quality product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the price. Would you like to take a chance on this low-quality product or wait for the next round?",
,,Bob,4,I'm not interested in taking a chance on a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next round and see if I can get a high-quality product at a discounted price. I'm not willing to risk losing $1000000 on a low-quality product.,no
