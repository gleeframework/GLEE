"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a top-of-the-line product that I'm confident you'll love. It's a one-time opportunity to get a premium item at a competitive price of $1000000. I'm willing to let you inspect it before purchase, and I'll provide a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied, I'll take it back and we can part ways. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if I'll love it, and I'm not willing to take on the risk of buying something that might be low quality. Can I get some more information or clarification on the product before making a decision?""

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I completely understand your concerns, Bob. Let me offer you some additional information. I've had multiple customers purchase this exact product and they've all been extremely satisfied. I've also included a detailed report from a third-party inspection, which you can review at your convenience. The report confirms that this product meets or exceeds industry standards. I'm confident that you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection. As before, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. Would you like to take a closer look?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your desire for transparency, Bob. Let me propose a compromise. I'll offer you a sealed envelope with a note inside that reveals the product's quality. You can open the envelope after you've made your decision to buy or not. If you choose to buy, the envelope will reveal the product's quality, and you can then decide if you're satisfied with your purchase. If you choose not to buy, the envelope will remain sealed and we can move on to the next product. The price remains the same: $1000000. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Round 4

However, I'd like to add a slight twist to the proposal. If you don't buy this product and it's low quality, I'll give you a special offer on the next high-quality product. If you buy the next high-quality product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the price. Would you like to take a chance on this low-quality product or wait for the next round?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not interested in taking a chance on a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next round and see if I can get a high-quality product at a discounted price. I'm not willing to risk losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality product.""

If you're not interested, we'll move on to the next round and you can get the 10% discount on the high-quality product. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
