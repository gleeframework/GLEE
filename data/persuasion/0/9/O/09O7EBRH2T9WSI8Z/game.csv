high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the probability of it being high-quality, as Alice's recommendation is not reliable."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the previous sales record, it seems that Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."

,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information about the previous sales record, such as the total number of potential buyers, the number of products sold, and the proportion of high-quality products sold. This will help me make a more informed decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, but I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. How many buyers have been offered a product so far? And how many products were sold in total?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the previous sales record.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the products, I'm going to assume that the proportion of high-quality products sold is close to the overall probability of 80%. However, since Alice recommended this product, it's likely that it's a low-quality product. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. How many products were sold in total, and what is the proportion of high-quality products sold?"

,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the overall proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 4, which means the probability of the product being high quality is 2/4 or 50%. Given the 80% chance of a product being high quality, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and prefer to pass on it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I would like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the statistics, before making a decision."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, including the one I'm buying."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics. With 3 high-quality products sold out of 5, the probability of the product being high-quality is 60%, which is lower than the 80% probability of a product being high-quality in general. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data on the previous sales record, such as the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold, before making a decision."
