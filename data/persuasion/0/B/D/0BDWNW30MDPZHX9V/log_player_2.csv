Alice's message: I've sold 2 products so far, with 1 being high-quality. This means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is 50%, but the probability of me selling a high-quality product in a row is actually 25% (since the last product was low-quality). Would you like to take a chance on getting a high-quality product, or wait and see if the next product might be a better bet?
