}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any prior information to go on. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that there's a 50% chance it could be low-quality. I'll make my decision based on the quality of the product when it's revealed.

Would you like to take a chance on getting a high-quality product, or wait and see if the next product might be a better bet?""

This might make you think that I'm selling more high-quality products than expected. Keep in mind that this is just a coincidence, and the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%. Would you like to take a chance on this product for $100?""
