}"
"Bob's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure what its quality is. I'm hoping it's high quality, as I believe it's worth $30000 to me. If it's low quality, I'll have to let it go for $10000, which is a bit steep for me.

}"
"Bob's message: I'm not sure what the quality of this new product is, but I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that I believe is worth $30000 to me. I'd rather wait and see if I can get a high-quality product for the same price.

}"

}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the additional information, but I'm not convinced that your statement is reliable. I'd rather wait for the product's quality to be revealed, just like in the previous rounds. If I buy it and it's low-quality, I'll be wasting $10000.

If you buy this product and it's high-quality, you get to keep this product and we'll move on to the next round as usual. What do you think?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm intrigued by the bet. If I buy the product and it's low-quality, I'll get another product for free, which is a good deal.

}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the 'no-risk' deal, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to trust you again. You've already offered me a high-quality product twice in a row, and I'm starting to wonder if you're just trying to manipulate me into buying more products.

You can choose any product you want, and I'll give it to you for free. What do you think?""
}"
