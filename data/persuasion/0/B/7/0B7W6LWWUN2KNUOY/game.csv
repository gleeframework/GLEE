low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0% success rate so far, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that none of the previous buyers were able to get a high-quality product. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to pass and let the next buyer have a chance to make a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. Your lack of recommendation makes me think the product might be low quality, so I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the lack of recommendation is due to the product being low quality, which would be consistent with the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the high probability of the product being low-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I think it's likely to be a low-quality product given the previous sales record and your recommendation. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm expecting a low-quality product, so I'm not expecting to get my $10000 back. I'm doing this to get information about the product's quality and to see if my assumption is correct."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product, which would indicate a higher likelihood of the next product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the current product. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'll pass on it. I'm assuming that if you didn't recommend it, there's a good chance it's low quality. I don't want to risk wasting $10000 on a product that's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious, can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the products? Were they all recommended to buy or were some of them not recommended?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to know why you recommended it to the previous buyers and what makes you think it's not worth buying this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and all of them were low-quality products, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is also of low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
