**Reasoning:**

* **High Sales Rate of High-Quality Products:**  The fact that 3 out of 3 sold products were high quality suggests a strong pattern. Even if the probability of a single product being high quality is 33.33%, this data strongly suggests that Alice has access to a higher proportion of high-quality products.  
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation to buy adds further confidence. While she doesn't know the exact value to you, her recommendation implies she believes this specific product is likely high quality. 

**Risk vs. Reward:**

The potential reward of a $12,500 product outweighs the risk of a $0 product. While there's still a chance it's low quality, the available information points towards a favorable outcome."
