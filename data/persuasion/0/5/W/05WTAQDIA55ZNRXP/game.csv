,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I don't have any information to go on and the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the products sold were low-quality, which means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that I'm the 2nd buyer and there's been no high-quality product sold yet. This suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is still high, but I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not going to take the risk with the low sales record and no high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not sure if this is a good idea, Alice. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm worried that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to know more about the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'm the second buyer and the previous buyer didn't buy, so the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about the product's quality and I'm willing to take the risk.
