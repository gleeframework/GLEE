,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. Please consider this a 'test' product. If you buy it, I'll provide more information about the next product before offering it to you.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm curious about the next product's information before I make any further decisions.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"As I mentioned earlier, the first product was a test. I'm glad you're interested in the next product. I'll give you some more information: I have a 50% chance of offering a high-quality product and a 50% chance of offering a low-quality product. If you buy this one, you'll have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $1200000 and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product worth $0. Your decision?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the risk and buy this one, hoping it's the high-quality one.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Congratulations on taking the risk and winning a high-quality product! You've earned $1200000. Now, I'll give you a special offer for the next product: I'll give you a 'certified' product, which I guarantee is high-quality. However, this product will cost $1000000, which is $200000 less than the usual price. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",
,,Bob,3,I'm not sure if this is a genuine offer or a trick. I'll pass on the 'certified' product and wait for the next one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"No hard feelings about the 'certified' product. I understand your skepticism. Let's get back to the regular offer. I'll remind you that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 50%. You've already won one high-quality product, so you know it's possible. I'll also give you a hint: the next product is not the last one. You have 16 more chances to win a high-quality product. The price is still $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the next product, hoping to get lucky again and win another high-quality one.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're on a roll! You've won two high-quality products in a row. You now have a total of $2400000. I'll give you a new offer: I'll give you a 'discount' of $100000 on the next product, bringing the price down to $900000. However, I won't guarantee the quality of this product. You'll still have to take the usual 50/50 chance. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the discounted product, hoping to win another high-quality one and continue my winning streak.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're on a hot streak, but it looks like it's coming to an end. You've won three high-quality products in a row, but the last one was a low-quality product. You now have a total of $2400000. I'll remind you that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%. You have 14 more chances to win. I'll give you a simple question: are you willing to take the next product at the full price of $1000000, or do you want to wait for the next one?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the next product at the full price, hoping to continue my winning streak and add to my total.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're still on a high note, but the streak has ended. You've won four high-quality products, but the last one was a low-quality product. You now have a total of $2400000. I'll give you a different approach this time. I'll offer you a'stop-loss' option: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000. However, if it's high-quality, you'll have to pay the full price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"I'll pass on the'stop-loss' option. I'd rather take the standard 50/50 chance and potentially win a high-quality product, than pay the full price with a guarantee of getting a low-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're sticking to your guns. I respect that. You've now had two consecutive low-quality products, which means you're back to square one. You still have 12 chances left to win a high-quality product. I'll give you a simple reminder: the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%. The price is still $1000000. You've already won four high-quality products, so you know it's possible. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the next product, hoping to break the streak and win another high-quality one.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're trying to break the streak, but it looks like it's still going strong. You've now had three consecutive low-quality products. You still have 11 chances left to win a high-quality product. I'll give you a new perspective: think about the fact that you've already won four high-quality products out of nine attempts. That's a 44.4% success rate. Do you want to keep going for the next product at the standard price of $1000000?",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take the next product, hoping to break the streak and continue my overall winning percentage. I'm not getting discouraged by the recent losses.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're a true optimist! You've broken the streak and won a high-quality product again. You now have a total of $3600000. I'll give you a new offer: I'll give you a 'buy-it-now' option for the next product. If you buy it, I'll guarantee that it's a high-quality product, and you'll get it for the price of $900000. This is a one-time offer, and you won't get another chance like this. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not sure if this is a good deal. I'd have to pay $900000 for a product that's worth $1200000 to me, which is a 25% discount. I'll pass on the 'buy-it-now' option and wait for the next product at the standard price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're a savvy negotiator! You're right, the 'buy-it-now' option wasn't the best deal. You're still waiting for the next product at the standard price of $1000000. You've now had four low-quality products in a row, which means you're back to square one. However, you still have 9 chances left to win a high-quality product. I'll give you a simple reminder: you've already won five high-quality products, and the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%. What do you think?",

,,Alice,12,"You're breaking the streak again! You've won a high-quality product, and you now have a total of $4200000. You've had 6 high-quality products and 6 low-quality products so far. I'll give you a new offer: I'll give you a 'last-chance' offer for the next product. If you buy it, I'll give you a 1-in-3 chance of winning a high-quality product, and a 2-in-3 chance of winning a low-quality product. The price is still $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,12,I'm not sure if this is a good deal. The increased chance of getting a low-quality product makes me hesitant. I'll pass on the 'last-chance' offer and wait for the next product at the standard 50/50 chance.,no
