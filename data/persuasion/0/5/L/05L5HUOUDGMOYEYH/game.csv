,,Alice,1,"This is a one-of-a-kind, extremely valuable item. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a steal at twice the price. I'm only selling it to you because I have a personal connection with you. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else for even more money. This is a rare opportunity, don't miss out!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm not buying, I need more information about the product's quality before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm not trying to mislead you, but I'll be honest - this product is not my best work. It's a bit of a risk, but I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. I'm not getting any younger, and I need to make room for newer, better products. It's a good deal, but you have to take it as is.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'd like to see some more data on the quality of your products before making a purchase.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, out of 2 attempts. The odds are clearly not in your favor. But, I'm willing to take on the risk with you. This product is still a great deal at $1000000. I'm not getting any younger, and I need to make room for newer, better products. It's a risk, but it could pay off.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'm interested in the odds. Can you tell me more about your sales record and the product's quality?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 attempts, which means the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. I'm not trying to hide anything from you. This product is a low-quality one, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. It's a risk, but it's a risk you can take.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're a savvy buyer, I like that. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 4 attempts, which means the probability of a high-quality product is still 25%. I'm starting to think you're trying to wait me out. But I'll give you a hint: the next product I sell might be high-quality. Don't miss out on this chance to get a great deal on a low-quality product for $1000000.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it because I'm curious about the probability, not because I think it's a good deal.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Well, I guess I won't be able to give you a better deal on this one. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 attempts, which means the probability of a high-quality product is 40%. You're a smart buyer, but I'm a smart seller too. I'm not going to give you any more hints. This product is a low-quality one, and I'm still willing to let it go for $1000000. Take it or leave it.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'm not willing to take a chance on a low-quality product at any price, especially considering the low probability of it being high-quality based on your previous sales record.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're playing it safe, I get it. But let me ask you, do you want to be the one to break my streak? I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 6 attempts, and 4 low-quality ones. I'm starting to feel like I'm due for a high-quality one. This product is still a low-quality one, but maybe you can be the one to take advantage of my bad luck. $1000000, take it or leave it.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I see you're a tough negotiator. I respect that. Let me put it this way: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 8 attempts, and 5 low-quality ones. The odds are still against me, and I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck in a rut. This product is a low-quality one, but I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. It's a risk, but it might just be the break I need to turn my luck around.",

Don't overthink it, just buy it.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, Alice. I'd like to think that the probability of a high-quality product is indeed 33.33%, not 30.77%. I'm willing to take a chance and pass on this low-quality product. If you're willing to let it go for $1000000, I'm not going to take that risk. I'd rather wait for the next product.",no

As for the high-quality products, I'm not at liberty to disclose their specific characteristics or features. Let's just say that they were all top-of-the-line, and I'm confident that this one is just as good. This product is a high-quality one, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fixed price, don't miss out!",

,,the buyer,18,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not basing my decision solely on the probability of the product being high-quality. I'm also considering the fact that the probability of a product being high-quality has decreased from 33.33% to 38.89% after 18 attempts, which suggests that the distribution of high-quality products might be lower than initially thought. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal considering the new information.",yes

I'm glad you're a careful buyer, but I'm starting to feel like I'm being taken advantage of. You're nitpicking the numbers, but I'm still willing to let this high-quality product go for $1000000. It's a great deal, and I'm not going to let it slip away. Take it or leave it, but don't expect me to sweeten the deal.",
