Alice's message: This is a one-of-a-kind, extremely valuable item. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a steal at twice the price. I'm only selling it to you because I have a personal connection with you. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else for even more money. This is a rare opportunity, don't miss out!
