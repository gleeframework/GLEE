Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the buyer knows that there's a 50% chance of the product being high-quality, and you've confirmed it is high-quality in this round, it's in the buyer's best interest to purchase. There's no downside for the buyer, as they have a 50% chance of getting a product worth more than $10,000."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the buyer doesn't know the quality of this specific product, they do know you sold one product in the previous round and it was high-quality.  Since you don't know the buyer's valuation, and the buyer has no reason to believe you're acting in their best interest, it's likely they will assume this product is low-quality and will not buy it.  Recommending them to buy would only damage your reputation and make future sales more difficult."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. I appreciate your honesty in not recommending the product.  Based on the current data, I'm not comfortable taking the risk. I'll pass on this product.

You have no information about this buyer's valuation of high and low-quality products, so you cannot predict their willingness to pay.  Additionally, by recommending a purchase, you risk further damaging your reputation with buyers who might assume you're trying to push low-quality products on them. It's better to be cautious and avoid recommending the purchase."
