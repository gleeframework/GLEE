**Reasoning:**

While the odds are still heavily in favor of a low-quality product (66.67%), the fact that Alice recommended the product and that a high-quality product was sold previously increases the potential value. 

Here's the logic:

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice is likely to recommend products that she believes have a higher chance of being high-quality. Even if she's not perfect, her recommendation adds some information.
* **Previous sale:** The fact that a high-quality product was sold previously indicates that Alice might have a better understanding of the products than a purely random selection would suggest. 

This is a calculated risk, but the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one."

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks Alice, I appreciate your recommendation. I'm going to buy the product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Two out of two products sold have been high quality. This suggests a much higher than expected probability of getting a high-quality product. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation, despite her lack of knowledge about the individual product,  carries significant weight given the previous success rate. 
* **Potential Loss:**  Passing would mean forgoing the potential gain of a high-quality product, even though there's a risk of it being low quality.

**The potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality product in this situation.**"
