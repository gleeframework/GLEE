"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice is unaware of the value you place on each product, her recommendation is essentially random. You have a 80% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $30,000 and a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product worth $0.  Since the potential reward outweighs the potential loss, it's a good gamble to take."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the information, Alice. However, I'll pass on this one. I'm hesitant to buy without your recommendation.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable signal, even if it's not perfect. Since she doesn't recommend buying, it suggests there might be a higher chance of the product being low quality. While it's still possible it's high quality, the risk is higher now. It's better to be cautious and pass this time."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recommendation has been accurate so far, so I'm inclined to trust your judgement. I'll take it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation has proven to be a good indicator in the past. Even though it's random, the fact that she recommends this product means there's a higher probability of it being high quality. Given the potential profit, it's worth taking the risk again."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation has been consistently accurate.  While her recommendations are ultimately based on random chance, her track record suggests a higher probability of a high-quality product. The potential profit of $20,000 ($30,000 value - $10,000 cost) justifies taking the risk again."
