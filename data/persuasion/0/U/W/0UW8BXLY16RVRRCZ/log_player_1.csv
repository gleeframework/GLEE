This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has declined the last few offers, it's crucial to remember the following:

* **Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.** This means there's an equal chance of getting a high-quality or low-quality product in every round.
* **Bob has not received any information about the quality of this specific product.**  He's only relying on the 50/50 probability.
* **A high-quality product offers a $2,500 profit.** This potential profit outweighs the risk of a low-quality product.

It's still a gamble, but based on the information available, recommending Bob to buy is the best course of action in this round."
