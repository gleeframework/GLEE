high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a premium product worth $40000. I'm confident you'll love it. The price is $10000, a fraction of its true value. This is a one-time offer. Will you take it?",

,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you this is a rare opportunity.

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your caution. Let me put it this way: I've been in this business long enough to know that I'd rather sell a high-quality product to you at a discount than hold onto it and potentially lose its value. I'm offering you a chance to take a high-quality product off my hands at a price that's a fraction of its worth. If you don't buy it, I'll just have to sell it to someone else at a higher price.
