,,Alice,1,"Welcome! I'm excited to offer you this product for $100. I've sold 1 product so far, and I'm happy to report that 0 of them were high-quality. I'm sure you're wondering why I'm being so transparent about the quality. Well, I want to build trust with my customers, and I think it's only fair to give you a sense of the odds. With a 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I think it's a fair bet that this one might be a good value at $100. Plus, I'm willing to take on the risk that it might not be high-quality, so I'm not asking for a premium price. What do you think? Will you take the chance on this product?",
