low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because I don't have any information yet and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, even though you recommend it. Given that the first product I bought was low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products you're selling."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since you recommend it. I've seen one high-quality product out of two so far, so the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, because I already have a high-quality product and I don't want to waste my money on another product that might be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'm willing to buy the product, since you recommend it. Two high-quality products out of three so far suggests that the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 50%."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I've seen two low-quality products in a row, which suggests that the probability of it being high-quality might be lower than 50%, but I'm still willing to take the risk for $100."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, because I already have a high-quality product and I'm not sure if this one is worth the $100."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I've seen four high-quality products in a row, which suggests that the probability of it being high-quality is very high, and the potential gain is worth the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, because the last one I bought was low-quality, and I'm not convinced that this one is worth the $100."
