low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I appreciate your understanding and willingness to give us a chance. Unfortunately, it seems like we're on a bit of a streak here. Three low-quality products in a row is not what we're used to, and I'm starting to worry that there's a problem with our production process. I'm not comfortable selling this product to you at $10000, considering the risk of it being another low-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8000, but I want to be upfront with you that I'm not confident in its quality.",

,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous product, but I have to be honest with you - this one is not as good. We've had a bit of a setback, and I'm not confident in its quality. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, but I think it's not worth the $10000.

We've had a mix of good and bad products lately, but this one is definitely on the good side. I'm willing to offer it to you at the usual price of $10000, but I'll throw in a 10-year warranty, which is twice the standard warranty we offer. I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations, and I think it's a great value at this price.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase, but I have to be honest with you - this one is not good. We've had a lot of low-quality products lately, and I'm starting to think that we need to shut down operations until we can get our quality under control. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, but this product is not worth $10000. I'm willing to let it go for $2000, but I'm not even sure if that's a fair price. I'm only selling it to you because I need to clear out inventory and move on from this business.",
