Alice's message: I understand your hesitation, and I appreciate your cautious approach. Let me put your mind at ease. Since our last buyer didn't take the product, I can assure you that our sales record remains unchanged. Out of the 2 products offered, 1 was high-quality, and 1 was... well, not so much. The numbers are still 1:2 in favor of high-quality products. But I understand that numbers alone might not be enough. Would you like to take a chance on this product for $1000000, knowing that the odds are still in your favor?

Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase! I'm glad you're interested in learning more about our sales strategy. As for how we decide which product to recommend to each buyer, it's a combination of factors. We take into account the buyer's preferences, their risk tolerance, and the overall market demand. We also try to mix things up and offer a diverse range of products to keep things interesting. But I'll let you in on a little secret: sometimes, we like to throw in a curveball and offer a product that's a bit of a wild card. This new product, for example, is definitely a unique opportunity.
