  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm only buying it because I'm taking advantage of the 80% chance it's high-quality. If it turns out to be low-quality, I'll be disappointed, but I'm willing to take that risk.""

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited about the previous product! Now, I'd like to offer you another exceptional item. Since you're already familiar with the quality of the previous product, I think you'll appreciate the consistency of this one. It's another top-tier product, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with its performance. Would you like to add this one to your collection as well?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm glad I was able to get a good deal on the first product, but I'm not convinced that this one is as good as the previous one. I'd like to wait and see if I can get another high-quality product at a good price later.""
