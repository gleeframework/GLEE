Alice's message: You're a brave one, aren't you? Two for two, and still willing to take a chance. I'll give you the same pitch: 33.33% chance of high-quality, 100% chance of a deal. I've sold 2 products so far, and they were both... not what you'd call 'quality'. But that's just statistics, right? You're not here to make friends with the stats, you're here to make a deal. And I'm willing to make it easy for you: $100, and you walk away with... something.

Let me put it this way: the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is still 33.33%, and I've sold 3 products so far. But here's the thing: the law of averages says that eventually, I'll sell a high-quality product. And when I do, it'll be a game-changer. So, are you ready to be on the right side of history? $100, and you could be the one to break the streak.
