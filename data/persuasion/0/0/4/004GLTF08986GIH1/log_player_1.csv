}"
"Bob's message: I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product worth $4000000 to me. I'd like to wait for a low-quality product, which I can get for $0. I'm not interested in overpaying for a high-quality product.

If the next product I offer you is high-quality, I'll give you a $500,000 discount on that product. This way, you'll be able to get the next high-quality product for $1,000,000, just like this one. What do you say?""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying this product at any price. I'd rather take the guarantee as a standalone offer and wait for the next product.
