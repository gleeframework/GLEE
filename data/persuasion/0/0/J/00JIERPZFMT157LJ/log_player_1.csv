"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows the product is high-quality with a probability of 80%.  Since this round's product *is* high-quality, the expected value of the purchase is:

* 0.8 * $1,200,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $960,000

This is less than the price of $1,000,000, but still a positive expected value for Bob.  Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product."
"Bob's message: I'd like to pass on this one and wait for the next product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's decision to pass on the first product doesn't change the inherent value of the second product.  We still know that the product is high-quality, and the expected value calculation remains the same:

* 0.8 * $1,200,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $960,000

Even though Bob didn't buy the first product, the second product is still a potential positive value opportunity for him."
"Bob's message: I'll take a chance and buy this one, hoping it's high-quality again!
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's decision to buy the second product, even though he didn't know the quality, doesn't impact the value of the third product.  The third product is still high-quality, and the expected value calculation remains the same:

* 0.8 * $1,200,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $960,000

This is still a positive expected value for Bob, despite the risk he took on the previous round."

* 0.8 * $0 (value of low-quality product) + 0.2 * $1,200,000 (value of high-quality product) = $240,000

This is significantly less than the price of $1,000,000, making it a bad purchase for Bob. He should not buy the product."
