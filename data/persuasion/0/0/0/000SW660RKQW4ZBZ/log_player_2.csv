Alice's message: No worries, Bob! I completely understand. I'll let you know that the next product is actually a bit of a departure from the first one. It's a bit of a 'work in progress', and I'm looking to clear some inventory. I'm willing to let it go for the same price as before, $10000. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something unique and potentially valuable, even if it's not quite up to the same standards as the first product. What do you think?
