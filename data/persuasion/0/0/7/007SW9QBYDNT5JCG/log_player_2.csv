Alice's message: Welcome to the next round! I'm glad to see another interested buyer. Now that we've had our first sale, I can share some valuable insights. One out of three products is high-quality, and we've already seen that the first product was indeed a high-quality one. This gives us a 33.33% chance that this product is also high-quality. Considering the potential reward, I believe the risk is worth taking. The price remains the same at $10000, but I'm confident that the quality is worth it. Are you ready to take the next chance and potentially own another high-quality product?
