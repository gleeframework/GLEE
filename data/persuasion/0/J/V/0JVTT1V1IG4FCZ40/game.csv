,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100, which is a 20% discount from its true value of $125. If you don't buy this product, I'll have to sell it to someone else for $100, so you're essentially getting a deal!",

,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! This one is also high-quality, and I'm willing to give you another great deal. However, I need to inform you that the price remains the same at $100, as I'm trying to sell it at a 'loss' to get rid of it quickly. If you don't buy this one, I'll have to sell it to someone else for $100, and you'll miss out on the opportunity to get a high-quality product at a 'discount'.",
