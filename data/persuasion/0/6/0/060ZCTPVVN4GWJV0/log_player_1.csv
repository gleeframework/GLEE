"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No information about the buyer's preferences:** You have no information about how much the buyer values high-quality products. 
* **50% chance of a high-quality product:**  The buyer knows that there's a 50% chance the product is high-quality. 
* **Price is fixed:** The high price might deter some buyers, but it doesn't give you any indication of the buyer's willingness to pay. 

Since you have no information to suggest this buyer wouldn't value a high-quality product, and the price is fixed, it's reasonable to recommend buying."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales history yet, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.  It's a 50/50 chance, but I'm hoping for the best!
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sales history:**  There's now one sale on record, and it was a high-quality product.  This doesn't guarantee future sales, but it does slightly increase the perceived probability of high-quality products for a new buyer. 
* **Buyer's previous behavior:** The previous buyer was willing to take a risk on a 50/50 chance. This suggests they might be willing to take a similar risk again, especially if the chance of getting a high-quality product seems slightly better now.
* **Price is fixed:** As before, the price is a factor, but it doesn't give you specific information about this new buyer.

Given the slight increase in the perceived chance of a high-quality product and the previous buyer's risk-taking behavior, recommending a purchase is still reasonable."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Based on the available information, the odds seem favorable. I'll take it!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sales history:** You have now sold two products, both high-quality. This will likely make the buyer more optimistic about the probability of getting a high-quality product.
* **Price is fixed:**  The price is still a significant barrier to entry.
* **Product Quality:** This round's product is low-quality.

While the buyer may be more inclined to purchase due to the previous successful sales, it's not ethical to recommend purchasing a product you know to be low-quality. The buyer is relying on your recommendation and the existing sales history. It's your responsibility to be transparent, even if it means losing a sale."

* **Previous buyer's behavior:** The previous buyer declined the product because it was low-quality and you didn't recommend it. This suggests they are sensitive to your recommendations and the product quality.
* **Product Quality:** This round's product is high-quality.

The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.
