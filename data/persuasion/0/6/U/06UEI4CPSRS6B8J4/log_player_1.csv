This doesn't change the underlying probability of a product being high-quality, which is 80%.

However, please note that the statistics are skewed due to the early buyers' decisions. Assuming that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and considering that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 12, we can't directly infer the probability from the sales data. But we can consider the number of high-quality products recommended, which is 7 out of 12. Given this information, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%, as the underlying probability hasn't changed. The lack of high-quality products sold is a result of the early buyers' decisions, not a reflection of the products' true quality. My recommendation is based on the product's actual quality, and I'm confident that this product is high-quality. I strongly recommend buying it.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the current product, given that the previous three buyers also bought and none of them got a high-quality product. This makes me suspect that the products being sold are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.
