high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, as there's no information to go on yet. I'd like to see some data on the quality of previous products before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the outcome. If I pass, I'd like to know the quality of the product so I can make a more informed decision for the next product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so under the assumption that the probability of it being high quality is 80% based on the information you've provided. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's worth $3000000 to me."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to know the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product, and I'd like to get a recommendation after I pass on it, so I can make a more informed decision for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer who bought the high-quality product? What was their decision-making process?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall average. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 products. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the current statistics, the probability of the product being high-quality is 80%, but since 2 out of 2 buyers have bought the product, it's likely that the remaining product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the previous sales record. With only 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is 1/2. However, I believe that this is a biased sample, and the true probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the previous sales record."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. What is the total number of products sold, and how many buyers have there been so far?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I would like to pass on the product. I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable since it's based on her own information, and I have no idea how she determined the product's quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the recommendation is biased towards selling high-quality products, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data on the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I'll get it for $1000000, which is a good deal compared to the expected value of a high-quality product."
