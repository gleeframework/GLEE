Since you've seen two high-quality products in a row, it's possible that the next product might be low-quality. But, I'll let you in on a little secret: this product is actually a low-quality one.

If the next product I offer is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund for this purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the 'quality guarantee' offer.
