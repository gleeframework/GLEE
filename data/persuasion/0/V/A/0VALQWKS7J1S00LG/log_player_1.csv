If 0 out of 7 products were high quality, the probability of the current product being high quality is (1/3) / ((1/3) + (2/3)) = 1/3. However, I'm also considering the fact that Alice has seen the previous 7 purchases and has not recommended any of them, which might indicate that she has seen more low-quality products.
