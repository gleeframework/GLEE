Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying the current product, even with the 10% discount and the chance to win a separate prize. The potential upside of the prize is uncertain and doesn't outweigh the risk of buying a product that may not be worth $900,000 to me.""
