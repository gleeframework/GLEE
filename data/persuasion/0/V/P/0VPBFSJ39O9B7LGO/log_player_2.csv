Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'd like to address them directly. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, regardless of the order in which they're sold. The fact that some early products were low-quality doesn't affect the probability of the next product being high-quality. In fact, the law of large numbers dictates that the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products should converge to the true probability as the sample size increases. With 6 products sold, the observed ratio is 4:2, but with 20 products in total, we can expect a more representative sample. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $100, and I'm confident that it will meet your expectations.
