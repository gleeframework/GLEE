high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,

This means that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 50%, which is lower than the 80% chance of a product being high-quality. Given the low-quality product's value is $0, I'd rather wait for the next product, hoping to get a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
