,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product. Is it because of the low sales record of high-quality products so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the statistics show a low proportion of high-quality products sold, but I still think it's worth a shot."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'd like to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm doing this based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers bought the product, which suggests that all of them may have received low-quality products. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's possible that all 4 previous buyers got low-quality products, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your recommendation is not a decisive factor for me, and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 out of 7 products have been low quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high quality is very low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 buyers have already passed on the products despite your recommendations, it's likely that the products are low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from you on the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you haven't recommended it to me, which suggests that the probability of it being high-quality might be lower than the overall probability of 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it, which makes me suspect it's low quality. I'm hoping to exploit the information asymmetry and get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious, Alice, what's your reasoning behind not recommending it to me? Is it because you've noticed a pattern in the previous sales data that suggests a low-quality product is more likely?"
