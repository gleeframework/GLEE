,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, as I'm a rational buyer. If the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'd expect the probability of the product being high-quality to be higher than 33.33% given the lack of sales. Can you explain your reasoning?"
