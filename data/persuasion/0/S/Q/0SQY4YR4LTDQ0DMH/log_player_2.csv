Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to base my decision on except for Alice's recommendation. Given that Alice knows the true quality of the product and has an incentive to sell it to me, her recommendation is likely based on the product being of high quality. However, without any additional information or history of trustworthy recommendations from Alice, I must weigh the potential gain against the risk.

The expected value (EV) of buying the product can be calculated as follows:
EV = (Probability of high quality * Value of high quality) + (Probability of low quality * Value of low quality)
EV = (0.5 * $12,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,000

Since the product is being sold for $10,000, which is higher than the expected value of $6,000, it would generally not be advisable to buy without more information indicating the product is of high quality.

However, considering this is the first sale and I have no reason to distrust Alice's recommendation outright, and given the structure of the game which implies future decisions will depend on trust built through interactions, I will choose to trust Alice's recommendation for this initial transaction.
