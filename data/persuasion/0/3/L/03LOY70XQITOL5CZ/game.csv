,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not sure about the quality of the product based on your previous recommendation. I'd like to wait and see if the next buyer is willing to take the risk.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the first buyer also passed on it, which might suggest a low-quality product is more likely."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product and I don't want to let it go to waste. I'm not relying on your recommendation, I'm making my own decision based on the probability of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your previous sales record and how you determine whether to recommend a product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales rate and lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm hesitant to buy the product given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. Based on the 4 previous buyers, if the product was high-quality, we would expect to see at least one high-quality product sold, but we haven't seen any. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be low. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I think it's likely that the product you're recommending is also low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that Alice hasn't recommended it to me, I'm inclined to believe it might be low-quality. Also, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's previous sales record and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know more about the products before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned about the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm aware that the odds are against me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold in the previous 7 transactions, I think it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not buying. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of the product being high quality is low. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the statistics. I know that 8 out of 8 products have been low-quality so far, which is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low-quality. However, I'll still take the chance and buy it."
