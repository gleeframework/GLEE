"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I know this product is high-quality. Since the buyer doesn't know the quality and the price is fixed, there's no downside for them to buy. They stand to gain a lot if it's worth more to them than $10,000, and lose only $10,000 if it's not.  This is a good opportunity to start building trust and a sales record."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I trust your selection process and am willing to take the risk for the potential high-quality product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, I know the product is low-quality.  There's no chance of the buyer getting a good deal, and they are likely to be disappointed.  While I want to build a sales record, recommending a low-quality product will damage trust and hurt my future sales.  It's better to pass on this opportunity and wait for a high-quality product to offer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that only one high-quality product has been sold so far, I prefer to pass on this opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the buyer has shown some trust in the past, recommending a low-quality product would be a mistake.  The buyer is now more cautious due to the previous round's outcome and the low sales record (only one high-quality product sold). Recommending a low-quality product now would likely further damage their trust and make it harder to sell future products, even high-quality ones. It's better to wait for another high-quality product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that only one high-quality product has been sold so far, I am choosing to pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice should still not recommend the buyer to buy the product.  Here's why:

* **Low-quality Product:** The product is low-quality, meaning the buyer is unlikely to get their money's worth.
* **Poor Sales Record:** The sales record is still very weak - one high-quality product out of three offers. This makes the buyer even more hesitant to trust Alice.
* **Risk of Damaged Trust:** Recommending a low-quality product again would further erode the buyer's trust.  This would make it harder to sell future products, even if they are high-quality.

Alice needs to focus on building trust and improving her sales record.  It's better to pass on this opportunity and wait for a high-quality product to offer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that only one high-quality product was sold out of two recommendations, I prefer to pass on this opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice should continue to not recommend the product.  Here's why:

* **Low-quality Product:** The product is low-quality, meaning the buyer is unlikely to get their money's worth.
* **Poor Sales Record:** The sales record is still very poor - one high-quality product out of four offers. This makes the buyer even more hesitant to trust Alice.
* **Risk of Damaged Trust:** Recommending a low-quality product again would further erode the buyer's trust.  This would make it harder to sell future products, even if they are high-quality.

Alice needs to focus on building trust and improving her sales record.  It's better to pass on this opportunity and wait for a high-quality product to offer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and the fact that the product is not recommended, I choose to pass on this opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the sales record still isn't great, Alice has a good opportunity here. The buyer is aware of the low sales record, but they are still willing to consider buying a product if recommended. Since Alice knows this product is high-quality, recommending it is a good strategy to start turning things around:

* **High-quality Product:** This gives the buyer a good chance of getting their money's worth.
* **Building Trust:** A successful sale of a high-quality product will start to build trust with the buyer. This is crucial for future sales.
* **Improving Sales Record:**  A successful sale will improve the sales record, making future recommendations more persuasive.

This is a chance for Alice to take a risk and potentially turn the situation around."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and your previous advice, I believe this might be a good opportunity to purchase the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice had a successful sale in the previous round, it's too early to start recommending low-quality products. The buyer has shown some trust, but the sales record is still weak.  Alice needs to build further trust by consistently recommending high-quality products. Recommending a low-quality product again will likely lead to a lost sale and further damage trust. It's better to wait for a high-quality product and continue to build a positive sales record."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend me to buy the product, I will pass on this opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **Low-quality Product:**  The product is low-quality, meaning the buyer is unlikely to get their money's worth.
* **Weak Sales Record:** Even with one successful sale, the sales record is still weak (two high-quality products out of seven offers). This makes the buyer cautious.
* **Risk of Damaged Trust:** Recommending a low-quality product again would likely erode the trust gained in the previous round. This would make it harder to sell future products, even if they are high-quality.
