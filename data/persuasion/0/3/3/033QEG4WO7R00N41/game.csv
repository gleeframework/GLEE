low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the lack of information from the previous buyer. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33% and I'm hoping to get lucky."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality, and I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll make my own decision based on the statistics."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products recommended by you were low-quality. The probability of a high-quality product being recommended is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold? I'd like to make a more informed decision for the next product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm doing this based on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality might be higher than 33.33%."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable since none of the previous buyers were able to find a high-quality product. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to gather more data to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if Alice recommends a product, it's likely to be low quality, and I don't want to waste $1000000 on something worthless."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have already purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality has decreased. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 attempts, which suggests a 0% success rate. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyers' purchases, and none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the products sold so far may be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers passed on the products, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I'd rather wait for a product that has a higher chance of being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the current statistics, the proportion of low-quality products sold is 100% (5/5). I will pass on the product, as the probability of it being high-quality is likely low."
