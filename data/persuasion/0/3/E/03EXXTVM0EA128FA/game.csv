low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"Hello! I'm excited to offer you a unique product for $100. As you can see, I've sold a total of 1 product so far, and I'm happy to share that 0 of them have been high-quality. I'm hoping to break the streak! Would you like to take a chance and make this product yours?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it with a 66.67% chance of getting a lemon. I'm only buying because I'm the first one and I don't have any prior data to go off of.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'm glad to have another potential buyer. As you can see, I've now sold 2 products, and unfortunately, both of them have been low-quality. I'm starting to get a feeling that I might have a streak going on. But don't worry, I'm sure the next one will be different! Would you like to take a chance and see if I can break the streak?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, but I'm hoping it's high-quality to break the streak.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hello again! I've now sold 3 products, and unfortunately, all of them have been low-quality. It's starting to look like I might have a pattern going on. But, as the old saying goes, 'the third time's the charm'? Maybe this one will be different. Would you like to take a chance and see if I can finally get it right?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of this product being high-quality seems very low to me. I'd rather not risk wasting $100 on a low-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your concerns! You're right, the numbers don't look good for me right now. But, I want to assure you that I'm not giving up yet! I'm still convinced that I have a high-quality product hidden in there somewhere. Would you like to take a chance and help me break the streak? You could be the one to turn things around!",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not convinced. The odds are against you, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Ah, welcome! I'm so glad to have a new potential buyer. And I'm thrilled to say that I have a new product that's unlike the previous ones.

Would you like to take a chance and see if you can get in on the good stuff?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced the odds are as favorable as you think they are.

I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I want to remind you that the law of averages is on my side.

Would you like to take a chance and see if you can be the one to turn things around?",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your optimism, Alice. However, I'd like to point out that the probability of a high-quality product is not just 50%, but rather 33.33%.
