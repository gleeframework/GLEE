**Reasoning:**

Since there's no previous sales data, the only information we have is Alice's recommendation. While Alice might be biased towards selling, there's no reason to believe she's deliberately lying.  

Given the potential payoff of $10,000 if the product is high-quality, the risk of losing $10,000 if it's low-quality seems worth taking. This is especially true since the probability of a high-quality product is not negligible (33.33%)."
