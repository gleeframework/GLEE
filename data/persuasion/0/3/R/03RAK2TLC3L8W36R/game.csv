,,Alice,18,"Congratulations on your purchase! We're glad you're willing to take a chance on our product. As for your question, we can calculate the probability of a product being high-quality given your situation. With 5 high-quality products out of 13 total sales, the probability of a product being high-quality is 38.46%. However, since you're the 7th buyer, we can use Bayes' theorem to update the probability based on the data.
