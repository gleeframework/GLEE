However, I want to reiterate that this product is not one of my best, and I'm not trying to hide that from you. I'm hoping that the discount will give you a better sense of the value you'll get from purchasing it. If you're still unsure, I can offer you one more piece of information: I've had some customers who have purchased low-quality products from me and still been satisfied with their purchase. They've reported that the product has been usable for a short period, but it may not last as long as a high-quality product would. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $9500?""

  ""message"": ""I'm glad you're willing to take a chance, but I understand your need for more information. I've spoken with those customers, and they've reported using the low-quality products for short-term projects or as temporary solutions. One customer used it for a one-time event, and another used it for a prototype that was only needed for a few weeks. They both reported that the product performed adequately for their needs, but they wouldn't have used it for a long-term or critical application. I want to be clear that this product is not suitable for heavy use or long-term reliability. However, if you're looking for a temporary solution or a proof-of-concept, it might be sufficient. I'm still offering the discounted price of $9500. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll throw in a 1-year warranty, which covers any defects or malfunctions. Would you like to consider purchasing it now?""
