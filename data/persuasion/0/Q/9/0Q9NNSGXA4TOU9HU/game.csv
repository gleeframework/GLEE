low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I apologize if the testimonials didn't meet your expectations. I'm willing to provide you with some concrete data, but I need to be upfront with you - this product is a bit of a 'work in progress'. It's still in the testing phase, and I'm looking for someone who's willing to take a chance on it. I can offer you a 'beta tester' deal, where you'll get the product at a discounted price, and I'll provide you with regular updates and support as we work out the kinks. What do you say, are you up for being a pioneer in this new technology?",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not interested in being a beta tester. I'm a buyer, not a developer. I need products that are proven and reliable, not something that's still in the testing phase. I'm not willing to take on that kind of risk, especially at the full price of $10000.",no

,,Bob,11,"Alice, I appreciate the description, but I'm not convinced. Handcrafted by a renowned expert doesn't necessarily mean it's high-quality or worth $10000.

It's a rare find, and I think you'll love it. The price is still $10000, but I'm willing to let it go at that price because I know you're a savvy buyer. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find anything like it elsewhere. Would you like to take a chance on it?",
,,Bob,13,"Alice, I'm starting to feel like Groundhog Day. You're offering me the same product at the same price, and I'm not sure if it's worth the risk. Can you tell me something new about this product that makes it different from the previous ones? Or are you just trying to sell me the same thing again?",no

,,Alice,15,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I apologize if my previous offers haven't met your expectations. However, I must admit that this next product is a bit of an outlier. It's not as polished as my previous offerings, but it has a certain... charm to it. The price is still $10000, but I'm willing to let it go at that price because I think it has potential. Would you like to take a chance on it?",
,,Bob,15,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not sure what to make of this product. You're saying it's not polished, but you're still asking me to pay $10000 for it.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"Ah, Bob, you're a tough negotiator, I like that! Alright, I'll be honest with you. This product does have some... quirks. It's not perfect, and it may not be the best fit for everyone. The build quality is a bit rough around the edges, and it may require some tinkering to get it working just right. And, to be honest, it's not as powerful as some of my other offerings. But, I think it has a certain charm to it, and I'm willing to let it go at a discount. Would you like to take a chance on it?",

,,Alice,18,"Ah, Bob, you're a tough nut to crack, I'll give you that. Alright, I'll be honest with you, this next product is... well, it's not my best work, to be honest.
