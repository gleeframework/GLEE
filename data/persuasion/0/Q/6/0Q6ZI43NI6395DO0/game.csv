I'm not offering any discounts or guarantees this time, but I am willing to make it a 'no-risk' purchase: if you buy it and don't like it, I'll take it back and give you a full refund, no questions asked. It's a chance to try something new without any financial risk.",

Since you've been patient and given me a chance to show you my best products, I'll make a special exception: I'll give you a 15% discount on this product, making it an unbeatable deal at $85. This is a one-time offer, and I think you won't find a better value anywhere else.",

However, I want to let you know that this next product is actually one of my 'clearance' items, and I'm willing to let it go for an extremely low price of $80.
