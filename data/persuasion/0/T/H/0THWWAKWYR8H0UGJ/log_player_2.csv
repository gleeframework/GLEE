Alice's message: Thank you for your trust! I'm glad you're willing to give me another chance. As for the adjustments I've made, I've implemented a new quality control process to ensure that every product meets our high standards. I've also invested in new equipment and trained my team to handle the products with extra care.

Alice's message: Excellent question! You're thinking like a true economist. Yes, the expected value of buying this product is indeed $50, since there's an equal chance of it being high-quality or low-quality. However, I'd like to remind you that the expected value is just a theoretical concept, and the actual value of the product could be higher or lower.
