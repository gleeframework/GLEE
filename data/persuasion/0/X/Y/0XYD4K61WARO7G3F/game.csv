low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Hello! I'm offering a product at $100. Please be aware that there's a 50% chance you might receive a high-quality item, but this one is on the lower end. This could still be a good deal, depending on its value to you. Consider your needs before making a decision.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality since I've seen that 1 out of 1 high-quality product was sold so far, which suggests that high-quality products might be relatively rare. I'll just have to hope for the best!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Greetings! I'm offering a product at $100. Given the past sale, you might be interested in knowing that high-quality items are quite rareâ€”only 1 out of 2 products sold so far has been high-quality. This could be a chance to get a good deal on a potentially valuable item, despite it being low-quality. Proceed with an understanding of the rarity of high-quality items.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Your warning about the rarity of high-quality items makes me think twice, and I'd rather wait for a more informed decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Hello! I'm offering a product at $100. Considering the rarity of high-quality items (only 1 out of 3 products sold so far has been high-quality), you might want to weigh the potential value against the cost. This could be a good deal, especially if you're open to the possibility of receiving a low-quality item. Make sure to consider your needs and preferences before deciding.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, considering the relatively low price and the fact that the first two buyers also took the risk and bought the products. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality item.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Hello! I'm offering a product at $100. Based on the previous sales, you might be interested to know that the first three products sold were all low-quality. However, given the low price and the possibility of getting a high-quality item, this could be a reasonable risk to take. Make sure to consider your needs and the potential value of the product before making your decision.",
,,the buyer,5,I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'd like to see more data on the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.,no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,

Given the positive feedback from previous buyers, this could be a great opportunity to secure a top-notch product. Don't miss out on this chance for excellence.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the product is high quality based on the statistics. Out of 3 buyers, only 1 got a high-quality product, which suggests that the probability of getting a high-quality product might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Hello! I'm offering a product at $100. Given the current statistics, you might be interested to know that the last two products sold were both low-quality. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the quality is consistently low; it's simply a reflection of the current sales. If you're comfortable taking the risk, this could be a good deal, especially considering the low price. Make sure to consider your needs and preferences before deciding.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the low-quality products sold in the past might be a fluke. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the low price is a good incentive.",yes

If you're comfortable taking the risk, this could be a good deal, especially considering the low price. Make sure to consider your needs and preferences before deciding.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to know if you have any information about the quality of the products that were sold previously. Was it just a coincidence that the last two products sold were low-quality, or is there a pattern?",yes

,,the buyer,15,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the increased probability of a high-quality product is enough to justify the $100 price tag, especially considering the 50% chance of getting a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.",no
