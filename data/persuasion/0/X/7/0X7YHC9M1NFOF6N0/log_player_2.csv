"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice does not recommend buying the product, and we know she knows the true value of each product, it's highly likely that the product is low quality. It's not worth risking $1,000,000 on a product that likely has no value to us."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  I'm sticking with my strategy of passing on products you don't recommend.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's lack of recommendation continues to be a strong indicator that the product is low quality.  It's still not worth the risk to buy, even with the information from the previous round.  We're building a strategy based on Alice's knowledge, and so far, it's working."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'm going to trust your judgment and buy this product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a significant shift. Alice's recommendation is now in our favor. While there's still a chance it's a low-quality product, the fact that Alice is recommending it strongly suggests it's high-quality. The potential reward of $4,000,000 outweighs the risk of $1,000,000 loss."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  I'm going to play it safe and pass on this one.  Your past recommendation was spot on, but I'm still wary of products you don't recommend.""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's past recommendation was accurate, we've learned that her lack of recommendation can be a strong indicator of a low-quality product.  The potential reward isn't high enough to outweigh the risk of buying a product she doesn't recommend, especially after seeing two consecutive low-quality products."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Explanation:**

We're seeing a pattern emerge: Alice's recommendation is a reliable indicator of product quality.  Since she doesn't recommend this product, it's likely low quality. The risk of losing $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gain of a product that is likely worth nothing."

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Explanation:**
