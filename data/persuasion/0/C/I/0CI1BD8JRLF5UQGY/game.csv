,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, since there's no data to go by."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0% success rate so far, but I'm not convinced that this is a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'd like to take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if the product is high quality and change the statistics for future buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality. Alice's recommendation also suggests that she thinks it's not worth buying. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on the product and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the fact that all previous recommendations from you have been for low-quality products, which is consistent with the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product. I'd like to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 buyers have not purchased high-quality products, which suggests that the products sold so far are likely low-quality. Given the low probability of a high-quality product (33.33%), I'm inclined to pass on this product and hope that the next one will be high-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also received the recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of the first 3 products were low quality, and Alice is recommending the product, I'm concerned that it might be low quality as well. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm not going to buy this product based on your previous recommendations and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. It seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer and I don't have any information about the product's quality, but I know that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, given the current statistics."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 products recommended by you were low-quality, I believe your recommendations are not reliable. I will not buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Alice, I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation based on the statistics. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems that your recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to take a chance and buy the product myself to see if I can get a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations to the other buyers, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the probability of the product being high-quality, not on your recommendation."
