If you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% chance to inspect it for free. If it's indeed high-quality, you'll get to keep the product and I'll refund you the full $10000. But if it's low-quality, you'll get a full refund and I'll give you a second product, which will be a low-quality one. This way, you'll get a free product either way. What do you say?",
