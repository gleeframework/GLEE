,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has recommended a product to the previous buyer, and it was low quality. This suggests that Alice may be biased towards recommending low-quality products. I'd rather wait for another opportunity."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers also received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality.
