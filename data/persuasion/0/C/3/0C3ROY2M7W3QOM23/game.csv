That being said, I want to be transparent with you - we've now sold 2 products, and only 1 of them was high-quality. The other was low-quality, just like this one. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the odds are now 1 high-quality product out of 2 total sales, which is a 50% chance. What do you think?",

This product is available for $1000000. I'll also mention that we're getting closer to a point where the law of large numbers might start to apply.
