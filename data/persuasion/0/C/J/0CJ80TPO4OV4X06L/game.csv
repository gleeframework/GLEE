high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, the proportion of high-quality products is 0. I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm aware of the statistics and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far is an anomaly and the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision. How many total products have been offered, and what's the proportion of high-quality products in the sales record so far?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far makes me think that the probability of this product being high quality is low."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, and there's a high chance this one might be low-quality as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to take the risk. Given the current statistics, it seems like all previous buyers were discouraged by Alice's recommendations, which might indicate that all products are low quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it and 4 out of 4 previous products were low quality, I'm inclined to believe that this product is also low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were discouraged from buying by Alice, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that Alice is trying to get rid of low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"
