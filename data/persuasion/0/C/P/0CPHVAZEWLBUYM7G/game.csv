,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations, as none of the previous buyers purchased the products after your recommendations. This suggests that the products recommended by you are likely to be low-quality."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
