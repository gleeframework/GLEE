low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure what to expect. I'll take the risk and see what I get."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm going to buy it, despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high, and I don't want to let the product go to waste if it is high quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products, given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers bought the products despite no high-quality products being sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to beat the odds!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but given Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. Given the lack of evidence, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous products were low quality, I think the probability of this product being high quality is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyers have a very poor track record of purchasing high-quality products. Given the low quality of the products they've bought so far, it's likely that the current product is also low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think the lack of high-quality products sold so far is indicative of the overall quality of the products, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Given that Alice recommends the product, it might be a low-quality product. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. With a 0% success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about this one. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's lack of recommendation is making me suspicious that the product might be high-quality, and I'm trying to exploit this information. I'm aware that I'm making a gamble, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the high proportion of low-quality products in the previous sales, and the fact that you recommended me to buy it. This seems suspicious."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and all of them were low-quality products. This is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd rather pass on it and avoid the loss of $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the products sold so far are likely to be low-quality. With a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'll pass on this one."
