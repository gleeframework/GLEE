,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware that I'm the first buyer, and I'm taking a risk, but I'm willing to take it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyers' purchases, but the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0, which suggests that the previous buyers might have been misled by Alice's recommendations. I'd like to wait and observe more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous two buyers who received recommendations to buy also bought, and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards selling low-quality products, so I'd rather wait for more information or take the chance of getting a high-quality product on my own."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the statistics.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. This suggests that the product is likely low quality, which is consistent with the 66.67% chance of low-quality products. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and avoid the cost of $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have passed on the products, which suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the fact that 3 buyers have passed on the products previously, and none of the products sold were high-quality, suggests that the products are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better opportunity."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think it's likely to be low quality based on the fact that none of the previous 3 products were high quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'm also considering the fact that you've recommended not to buy it, which might be due to the fact that the previous 3 buyers didn't buy, but that doesn't necessarily mean the product is low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I'm willing to take the chance of getting a high-quality product for $1000000, which is a great deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of a high-quality product is still high enough to make it a worthwhile risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I want to see if Alice's recommendation is correct. I'm not making a value judgment based on the statistics, but I'm curious to know the product's quality."

,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
