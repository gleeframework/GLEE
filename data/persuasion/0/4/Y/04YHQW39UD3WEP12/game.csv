high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,

My statistics are: 10 high-quality products not sold, 1 low-quality product sold, and 4 low-quality products not recommended. The initial probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. This product meets the high-quality standard, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to purchase a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the fact that Alice's recommendation is based on her limited information and the first buyer didn't purchase the product, which might indicate a low-quality product was sold. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
