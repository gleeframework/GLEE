``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** We only have one previous buyer's data, making it hard to judge Alice's recommendation accuracy.
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the true quality of the product, so her recommendation has value.
* **Potential Upside:** Even with a 50/50 chance, a high-quality product offers a $100 profit, while a low-quality product results in a $100 loss. The potential profit outweighs the potential loss in this scenario.

**Therefore, it's a calculated risk worth taking.  Since Alice is recommending it, and there's a chance of a significant profit, buying the product is the best strategy.**"
