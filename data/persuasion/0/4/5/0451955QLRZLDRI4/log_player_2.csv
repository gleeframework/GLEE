Alice's message: This is the first product I'm offering. It's a one-time opportunity to get a high-quality item. I'm selling it for $1000000. I'm not willing to negotiate the price, but I'm willing to provide you with information about my sales record. As of now, I've sold 0 products, and I have 1 high-quality product. If you're interested, you can take it home for $1000000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

Alice's message: I understand your concerns from the previous buyer. I'd like to assure you that I'm committed to transparency. As of now, I've sold 0 products, and I have 2 high-quality products in stock. I'm willing to offer this product to you for $1000000. I'd like to remind you that the previous buyer was hesitant due to lack of information, but I'm happy to provide you with the same information. If you're still unsure, I can offer you a 'guarantee' of sorts: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a 'discount' of $500000 on the next product you buy from me, if you decide to buy another one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
