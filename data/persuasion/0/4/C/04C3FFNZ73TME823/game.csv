low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I don't have any information about its quality and I'm not influenced by Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and I don't have any information about the product's quality yet."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold given that you recommended it. This will help me make a more informed decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it, which suggests it might be a low-quality product. If it's high-quality, I'll be making a loss, but if it's low-quality, I'll be making a gain. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that Alice has recommended 3 products so far and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall average, making it a riskier purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I think it's likely that the product I'm offered is low-quality, and I don't want to risk wasting $10000 on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm the 4th buyer and I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far is a good indication that the remaining products are likely to be low-quality. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product, even though Alice doesn't recommend it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products changes."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous 4 buyers have all passed, it seems like the previous products were low-quality. The fact that you're recommending me to buy it now makes me skeptical, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take my chances and hope it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low sales of high-quality products so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product since the previous 6 buyers all passed on the products after your recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because you're concerned that it might be low-quality?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm assuming that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
