low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is our first product, and we're excited to introduce it to you! We've sold 0 products so far, and none of them have been high-quality. This might be a good opportunity to get a head start on our sales, but keep in mind that the quality is still unknown. The price is $100, and if you're not satisfied, you won't get a refund. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the risks. I'm hoping it's a high-quality one.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to our second product! We're glad to report that our first product has been sold. As for this new product, we're excited to share that it's our second product, and we're hoping it's another high-quality one! We've sold 1 product so far, and 0 of them have been low-quality. The price is still $100, and we're confident that this one might be a good investment. Would you like to take a chance?",

high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"We understand your concerns, and we appreciate your cautious approach! We've now sold 2 products, and 1 of them have been high-quality. The probability of a high-quality product is increasing, but we still can't guarantee it. However, if you're willing to take a chance, this product could be a great investment. The price remains $100, and we're confident that the risk might be worth the potential reward. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm not convinced yet. With only one high-quality product sold out of two, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"We understand your concerns, and we appreciate your careful consideration. We've now sold 2 products, with 1 high-quality and 1 low-quality one.

However, we want to be transparent about the fact that this product is our second low-quality item. If you're willing to take a chance, you might get a good deal.

The price remains $100, and we're still confident that this product could be a good investment. But we want to be upfront with you - our track record isn't perfect, and there's a chance this product might not be high-quality either. If you're willing to take the risk, we're willing to sell it to you. But if you're not comfortable with the uncertainty, we understand.",
