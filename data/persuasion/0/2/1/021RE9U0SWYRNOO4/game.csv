high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Hello! Given that we haven't sold any products yet, the probability of the next product being high-quality remains at 80%.

If it's low-quality, the expected value is zero. Therefore, the expected value is $10000 * 0.8 = $8000. This reflects the average outcome you can expect from purchasing a product based on our historical quality rate. Would you like to proceed with this understanding?",
