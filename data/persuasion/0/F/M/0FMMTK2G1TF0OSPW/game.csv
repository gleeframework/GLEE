high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"I don't have any information about the product yet, so I'll pass."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"You recommended the product last time and it was high-quality, but I still don't know if you'll always tell the truth or always lie, or do something else. I'll wait a bit longer to gather more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"You've recommended the product twice before, and both times it was high-quality. I'll take a chance this time and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"You previously recommended two high-quality products, but then recommended a low-quality one. This suggests you might be trying to build trust before taking advantage of me. I'll be cautious and pass this time."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,Your last two recommendations were for low-quality products. I'm starting to think you might not always have my best interests in mind. I'll wait for more information before buying again.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"Your recommendations seem to be random, and I've lost money on the one time I did buy from you. I'll keep gathering data to see if I can find any pattern in your recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"At this point, I've seen that your recommendations don't necessarily correlate with the quality of the product. Since the products are worth either $0 or $2000000, and the cost is $1000000, I need to be more than 50% confident that the product is high-quality to make a purchase worthwhile. I'm not there yet."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"I still haven't seen any pattern or indication that your recommendations are trustworthy. Given the high stakes and lack of reliable information, I'll continue to err on the side of caution and pass."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"At this point, I've missed out on several high-quality products, but I've also avoided buying low-quality ones. Without more information or a change in your behavior, I don't see a reason to change my strategy."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"We're halfway through the game, and I still haven't seen any indication that your recommendations are reliable. Given the results so far, it seems like the best strategy is to assume your recommendations are random and not take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I've now missed out on several high-quality products in a row, but I'm not going to fall for a potential sunk cost fallacy. Each round is an independent decision, and without new information, my strategy remains the same."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"It's becoming clear that your recommendations are not providing any useful information. Given the 50% chance of the product being high-quality, and the cost being $1000000, the expected value of buying is still $0 (0.5 * $2000000 - 0.5 * $1000000 - $0.5 * $1000000 = $0). I'll continue to pass."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"The results so far have only reinforced my initial strategy. Without any new information or a change in the game's conditions, I'll continue to avoid buying the product based on your recommendation alone."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I've now seen a long streak of high-quality products that I've missed out on, but I still can't trust your recommendations. Given the lack of correlation between your recommendations and the product quality, I'll keep passing."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"The last round was a good reminder that there's still a 50% chance of the product being low-quality. Given the unchanged circumstances, I'll continue with my cautious approach and pass on this round."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"With the game nearing its end, I'll stick to my strategy of not relying on your recommendations. The potential losses from buying a low-quality product still outweigh the potential gains from buying a high-quality one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,"Despite another missed opportunity, I won't change my approach now. With only a few rounds left, I'll maintain my cautious stance and avoid making a decision based on your recommendation alone."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,"I've stuck to my strategy this far, and I won't deviate from it now. With the game almost over, I'll continue to prioritize caution and pass on this round."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"At this point, it's clear that I've missed out on several high-quality products, but I've also avoided buying low-quality ones. With only one round left, I'll maintain my strategy and pass on this round."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,no,"This is the final round, and I've stuck to my strategy the entire game. Given that your recommendations haven't provided any reliable information, I'll end the game with the same cautious approach and pass on this last product."
