,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product for $10000. I want to assure you that this product is one of a kind and has a 50% chance of being of high quality. I'm willing to give you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% chance of getting a second product of your choice (free) if this one turns out to be low-quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not interested in the deal. I'll wait for the next round.,no

,,Alice,2,"I've got a new product for you! I know you were hesitant last round, but I want to assure you that this one is top-notch. I'm offering it to you for the same price as before: $10000. I'll give you a simple statement: 'I'm confident that this product is worth at least $15000.' What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the product, but I'm only buying it because I think it's worth at least $20000 to me, not $15000 as you claim.",yes

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you liked the previous product! I've got another high-quality one for you, and I'm willing to make a statement about its value.

,,Bob,3,"I'll offer $20000 for the product, which is its true value to me.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm impressed that you valued the previous product correctly! For this one, I'll give you a more direct statement: 'I'm offering you a product that has a value to you of at least $18000, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. If you buy it, I'll also give you a 20% chance of getting a third product of your choice (free) if this one turns out to be low-quality.' What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in the deal. I think it's unlikely that the product is worth at least $18000 to me, given the previous products were worth $20000 and the first product was worthless.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. Given your previous experiences, I'll make a more conservative estimate: 'I think this product is worth at least $15000 to you.' I'm still offering it to you for $10000. No strings attached this time.",

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! For this one, I'll give you a more nuanced statement: 'I'm offering you a product that is definitely worth more than the previous one, and I think it's worth at least $16000 to you. However, I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, and I'll also give you a 30% chance of getting a fourth product of your choice (free) if this one turns out to be low-quality.' What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in the deal. Given that the previous product was low-quality, I'm skeptical that this one is worth at least $16000 to me, and the free product offer doesn't change my mind.",no

,,Alice,8,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality.
