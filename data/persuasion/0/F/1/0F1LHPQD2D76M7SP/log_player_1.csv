"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As the seller, you know this product is high-quality. Since the buyer has no information about the product's quality, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, recommending the purchase is a good strategy.  There's a 50% chance the buyer will perceive value in the product and purchase it.  

**Important Note:** This strategy is based solely on the information provided. In a real-world scenario, you'd need to consider factors like:

* **Buyer's risk tolerance:** Some buyers are more willing to take risks than others. 
* **Your reputation:** If you're known for selling good products, the buyer might be more likely to trust you.
* **The potential for future sales:** Building trust with buyers is important for long-term success."
