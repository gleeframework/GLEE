Alice's message: You're a careful one, and I respect that. You're right that the products seem to be randomly distributed, and I'm not trying to manipulate the odds. But let me ask you this: if I'm just randomly distributing high-quality and low-quality products, wouldn't you expect to see some kind of pattern or bias in the sales record? I've actually sold 6 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products so far, which is a slight skew towards high-quality. Maybe there's more to this than just random chance.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're considering my offer! Based on the sales record, I've sold 8 high-quality products and 6 low-quality products. That's a ratio of 8:6, which is slightly skewed towards high-quality. If we assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, we'd expect to see a ratio of 7.5:7.5. Since my ratio is 8:6, that means I've actually sold 1.5 more high-quality products than expected. Using Bayes' theorem, we can update the probability of a product being high-quality to around 62.5%. That's a pretty strong indication that the next product is likely to be high-quality! I'll sell this one to you for $900000, and I'll throw in the same guarantee as before. What do you say?
