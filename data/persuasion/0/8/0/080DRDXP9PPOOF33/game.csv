,,Alice,2,"You're a savvy buyer! I'll sweeten the deal. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 20% chance to buy the high-quality product in the next round for $750000. Remember, the high-quality product is worth at least $1000000, and you're essentially getting a 20% chance to buy it for a discount. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by the offer. The low-quality product is still worth $0 to me, and the chance to buy the high-quality product at a discount is not enough to make it worthwhile. I'll pass and wait for the next round.",no

This way, you're essentially getting two chances to buy the high-quality product at a discounted price, and you're not committing to buying a low-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm still not convinced. The low-quality product is worth $0 to me, and I'm not willing to take a chance on it.
