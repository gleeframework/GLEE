,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better."
