,,Alice,1,"You're our 1st buyer! This is a one-time offer: I'll sell you this product for $100. I'm not sure what you think it's worth, but I'm hoping you'll take a chance. I'll be honest with you, I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, which means I'm not doing great. If you buy this, you'll be my first sale, and I'm counting on your help to get my business started.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take a chance on you and your product. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, but I hope it's high quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to my 2nd sale! Unfortunately, my first sale was a low-quality product, and I'm still 0 for 2. I'm starting to worry that I might be selling a bunch of low-quality stuff. I'm offering this one to you for $100, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. I've sold 1 product so far, and it was a low-quality one. I'm hoping to break the streak with this one.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it more out of curiosity and a desire to break your losing streak than because I think it's a good value for me. If it's low quality, I'll be disappointed, but I'll at least know that I made a data point to inform my future decisions.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Welcome to my 3rd sale! I'm 0 for 3, and I'm starting to think I'm selling a bunch of low-quality products. I've sold 2 low-quality products so far, and I'm not sure what's going on. I'm offering this one to you for $100, but I'm being completely transparent - I'm not sure if it's worth it. If you buy it, you'll be my 3rd sale, and I'll be 0 for 3. You're taking a risk, but I'm hoping you'll be my first high-quality sale.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take a chance, but I'm only buying if it's high quality. If it's low quality, I'll be the 3rd low-quality product in a row, and I'll be quite disappointed. I'm hoping you're selling a high-quality product for the first time.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome to my 4th sale! I'm glad I was able to break my losing streak with a high-quality product! I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 sales so far, which means I'm doing a bit better than I thought. I'm offering this next one to you for $100, and I'm hoping it's another high-quality one. I'm not sure what you think it's worth, but I'm counting on you to help me keep the streak going!",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the previous high-quality product was a fluke, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Welcome to my 5th sale! I'm back to 1 for 4, and I'm starting to worry that I'm selling more low-quality products than I thought. I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row, and I'm not sure what's going on. I'm offering this one to you for $100, and I'm being completely transparent - I'm not sure if it's worth it. If you buy it, you'll be my 5th sale, and I'll be 2 for 5. You're taking a risk, but I'm hoping you'll be my next high-quality sale.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to buy the product, but I want to negotiate the price to $80. I'm willing to take the risk, but I think the low-quality streak is a concern. I'd like to get a discount to reflect the uncertainty.",yes

I want to assure you that I'm committed to selling high-quality products, and I'm willing to give you a guarantee: if this product is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and we can start fresh. That's how confident I am in this one.",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the sales record. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me?",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Welcome to my 7th sale! I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 6 sales now, which means the probability of a high-quality product being offered to you is 50%.

You'll have to make a decision based on the information you have.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is 50%, but since no high-quality products have been sold in the last 4 sales, I'm not convinced that the probability is as high as 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Welcome to my 8th sale! I'm back to 3 high-quality products out of 7 sales, and I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row. I'm starting to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to you might be lower than 50%. I'm offering this one to you for $100, and I'm being transparent - I'm not sure if it's worth it. If you buy it, you'll be my 8th sale, and I'll be 3 for 7. You're taking a risk, but I'm hoping you'll be my next high-quality sale.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it with a healthy dose of skepticism. I'm hoping it's the high-quality one, but I'm also aware of the possibility that it might be low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not getting my hopes up.",yes

I'm offering this one to you for $100, and I'm being brutally honest - I'm not sure if it's worth it. If you buy it, you'll be my 10th sale, and I'll be 3 for 9. I'm not trying to hide anything, and I'm hoping you'll be my next high-quality sale. But if you're looking for a safer bet, I understand.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to buy the product. I think the fact that you're being honest with me is a good sign, and I'm willing to take the risk. I also think that the fact that you've sold 4 low-quality products in a row might make this one more likely to be high-quality, since the probability of it being low-quality is lower than the overall average.",yes
