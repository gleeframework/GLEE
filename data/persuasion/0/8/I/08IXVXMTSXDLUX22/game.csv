,,Alice,3,"Welcome to our third product! I've sold two products so far, and I'm glad you're considering this one. I want to remind you that both of my previous sales were at the price of $100, and both were low-quality products. I'm offering this one to you for the same price. I'm curious - do you think the price is still a good value, or do you want to wait and see if I have a high-quality product available?",

Would you like to take a chance on a product that might be worth more than $100, or do you want to wait and see if I have a better option available?",
,,the buyer,4,I believe in your pricing strategy and am willing to take a chance on this product.,yes

I'm offering this low-quality product to you at the price of $100, which is a bit of a departure from my usual pricing strategy. I want to be upfront with you - I'm not sure if this product is worth $100, but I'm willing to take a chance on it. Would you like to take a chance on a potentially undervalued product?",

Given that I've sold one high-quality product out of seven attempts, it's possible that I'm due for another high-quality product. However, I'm offering this low-quality product to you for $100, which is the same price as all the previous low-quality products. Would you like to take a chance on a potentially low-value product, or do you want to wait and see if I have a high-quality product available?",

I'm confident that this product is worth more than $100, but I'm still offering it to you at the same price. I want to make a deal with you - if you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount if you can convince me that you've made a better offer to someone else.

However, I've also sold eight low-quality products in a row, which suggests that I might be having a bit of a streak. I'm offering this low-quality product to you for $100, which is the same price as all the previous low-quality products. I want to ask you - do you think my low-quality streak is just a coincidence, or do you think I'm due for a high-quality product? Would you like to take the risk and buy this product, or do you want to wait and see what I have next?",
