high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,no,,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"I'm recommending this product because the probability of it being high-quality is now 56.25%, which is higher than the previous product. My previous recommendation was based on the low probability of the product being high-quality, not because I think you're not a good fit."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, and you're recommending me to buy, I'm worried that the probability of this product being high-quality is very low. I'll pass on this one.",
