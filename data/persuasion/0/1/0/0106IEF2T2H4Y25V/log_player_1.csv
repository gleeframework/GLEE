"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the product is high-quality, and Bob values a high-quality product at $125, while the price is only $100, it's in Bob's best interest to buy.  This is a guaranteed profit for Bob."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The previous round's outcome is irrelevant. Bob still doesn't know how Alice determines her recommendations, so he can't infer anything about the current product's quality.  Again, Alice knows this product is high-quality, making it a profitable purchase for Bob."

Bob bought the product!

```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob is starting to suspect Alice might have a way to know the product quality, there's no evidence to support this.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

"Bob's message: Alice, you're on a roll! I'm sold. Let's make it eight in a row!
Bob bought the product!

Round 9
This round's product is high-quality.

"Bob's message: Alice, this is a surprise!  You've been so spot on with your recommendations, so I'm hesitant to buy without your advice.  I'll pass for now, but I'm interested in hearing why you don't recommend this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

Bob didn't bought the product.
