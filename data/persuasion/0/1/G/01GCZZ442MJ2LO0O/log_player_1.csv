I'll give you a 10% discount on the product, making it $90. I think it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a great price. What do you think? Will you take advantage of this offer?""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant. While your last product was high-quality, the overall sales record is mixed. Since there's a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, which would be worth nothing to me, I'm not comfortable taking the risk at this price.  Perhaps if you offered a further discount, or if the sales record improves, I'd be more interested.

I think it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a great price. What do you think? Will you take advantage of this offer?""}"
"The buyer's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer and your efforts to improve your record. However, the current statistics still show a 33% chance of selling a high-quality product.  Since the product is worth $200 to me if it's high quality, and $0 if it's low quality, I'm not comfortable taking the risk at this price point.
