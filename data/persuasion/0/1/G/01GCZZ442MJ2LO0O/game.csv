,,Alice,1,"Hello! I'm excited to offer you this product for $100. I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you say? Will you take it home?",
,,the buyer,1,"Thanks for the information! I'm happy to be the first buyer. Based on your recommendation, I'm willing to take a chance on the product. Let's do it!",yes

,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in my product. I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and I'm excited to share that with you. However, I want to be transparent with you - my sales record is not perfect, and I've had some... let's call them 'learning experiences'. I'm willing to take the risk and offer you this product for $100, but I want to make sure you're aware of the potential risks. What do you think? Will you take a chance on this one?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thanks Alice! I appreciate your honesty. Even though your record isn't perfect, I'm willing to take a chance. I'll buy it!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hi there! I'm glad you're considering my product. As I mentioned earlier, I've had some mixed results with my sales. With that in mind, I want to offer you a slightly different deal. I'll give you a chance to 'bet' on the quality of the product. If it's high-quality, you'll get the product for $100. If it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. It's a 50/50 chance, but it might be a good way to mitigate the risk. What do you think? Are you willing to take the bet?",
,,the buyer,3,I'm interested in the bet! I'll take the product.  I'm happy to take the risk on the potential for a high-quality product.,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Hi! I'm glad you're considering my product. As you might have noticed, my sales record is a bit mixed, but I'm proud to say that my last product was high-quality. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer you a special deal. I'll give you a 10% discount on the product, making it $90. I think it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a great price. What do you think? Will you take advantage of this offer?",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant. While your last product was high-quality, the overall sales record is mixed. Since there's a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, which would be worth nothing to me, I'm not comfortable taking the risk at this price.  Perhaps if you offered a further discount, or if the sales record improves, I'd be more interested.  ",no

Since the product is worth $200 to me if it's high quality, and $0 if it's low quality, I'm not comfortable taking the risk at this price point. I'd be happy to revisit this if your sales record improves further.",no
