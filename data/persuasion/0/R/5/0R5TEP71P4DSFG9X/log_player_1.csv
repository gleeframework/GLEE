* **Buyer's knowledge:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. This means they expect a high-quality product with a good chance. 
* **No information on value:** You don't know the buyer's specific valuation of a high-quality product, but since there's a high probability of it being high-quality, they are likely to find it valuable. 
* **No risk:** The buyer has no prior information about your selling history, so they are not taking any risk based on past performance. 

Given these factors, it's reasonable to recommend the buyer to buy the product. There's a high chance they will be happy with the quality, and the price is fixed."
