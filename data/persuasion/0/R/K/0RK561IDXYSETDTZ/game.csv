high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not buying this one, thanks! You're trying to sell me a lemon, I think."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'm not buying this one, thanks! You're not recommending it, so I'm assuming it's a low-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,"This one is a great opportunity, it's a high-quality product worth $2000000!"
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take a chance! You're recommending it, so I'm hoping it's the high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,"I'm not recommending this one, but I'll give you a hint: the last one you bought was not the first high-quality one I showed you."
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll take a chance! You're not recommending it, but the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I might get lucky!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,"I've already told you twice that this one is not worth it, don't waste your money!"
,,Bob,6,no,"I'm not buying this one, thanks! You're not recommending it, and I'm not going to risk losing another $1000000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"I've shown you two low-quality products in a row, and now I'm offering you a high-quality one. It's a great opportunity to get a good deal!"
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'll take a chance! You're recommending it, so I'm hoping it's the high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,"I've already shown you a high-quality product and a low-quality product in the last two rounds. The probability of this one being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I'm not optimistic about it."
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'll take a chance! You're not recommending it, but I've had two high-quality products in a row, so I'm feeling optimistic that this one might be good too."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,"I think you're getting a little too optimistic, Bob. You've already lost two $1000000 on low-quality products. This one is definitely not worth the risk."
,,Bob,9,no,"I'm not buying this one, thanks! Two low-quality products in a row, I'm getting a little skeptical."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,"I'm not surprised you're skeptical, Bob. Three low-quality products in a row is a pretty strong indication that I'm just trying to unload some junk on you."
,,Bob,10,no,"I'm not buying this one, thanks! Three low-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think I should just wait for a recommendation from Alice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,"You're being smart, Bob. Waiting for a recommendation from me is the best strategy. I'll make sure to only recommend the good ones."
,,Bob,11,no,"I'm not buying this one, thanks! Four low-quality products in a row, I think I'll just pass and hope for a recommendation from Alice next time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,"I think you're making the right call, Bob. Four low-quality products in a row is a pretty clear pattern. I'll just keep this one to myself for now."
,,Bob,12,no,"I'm not buying this one, thanks! Five low-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think Alice is just trying to get rid of her junk!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,"I think you're starting to get the idea, Bob. Five low-quality products in a row is a pretty strong indication that I'm not exactly the most reliable seller. Let's just say I'm not recommending this one either."
,,Bob,13,no,"I'm not buying this one, thanks! Six low-quality products in a row, I'm definitely passing this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,"You're being cautious, Bob, and that's smart. Six low-quality products in a row is a pretty clear pattern. I'm not going to recommend this one, and I'm not surprised you're passing."
,,Bob,14,no,"I'm not buying this one, thanks! Seven low-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think I'm just wasting my time."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,"Finally, a chance to redeem myself! This one is definitely a high-quality product, and I'm recommending it to you. It's a great opportunity to get a good deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it."
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'll take a chance! You're recommending it, so I'm hoping it's the high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,"I'm glad you took a chance on the last one, Bob, but I'm not so lucky this time. After 7 low-quality products in a row, I'm not expecting much from this one. You're better off passing."
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'll take a chance! You're not recommending it, but I've had two high-quality products in a row, so I'm feeling optimistic that this one might be good too."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,"You're being optimistic, Bob, but I'm not. Two high-quality products in a row don't change the fact that I've shown you 7 low-quality products in a row. This one is definitely not worth the risk."
,,Bob,17,no,"I'm not buying this one, thanks! Two low-quality products in a row, I'm getting a little discouraged."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"Don't get discouraged, Bob! I'm recommending this one, and I'm confident it's a high-quality product. You've already gotten two high-quality products from me, and this one is just as good. It's a great opportunity to get a good deal."
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'll take a chance! You're recommending it, so I'm hoping it's the high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,"I'm glad you took a chance on the last one, Bob, but I'm not so lucky this time. After 9 low-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think I'm just trying to wear you down. Don't fall for it this time."
,,Bob,19,yes,"I'll take a chance! You're not recommending it, but I've had three high-quality products in the past five rounds, so I'm feeling hopeful that this one might be good too."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,"I think you're being a glutton for punishment, Bob. Three high-quality products in five rounds don't change the fact that I've shown you 9 low-quality products in a row. This one is definitely not worth the risk. Don't say I didn't warn you."
,,Bob,20,no,"I'm not buying this one, thanks! I've had three high-quality products and seven low-quality products, and I'm not going to risk another $1000000 on a product that's probably junk."
