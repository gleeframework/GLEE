,,Alice,1,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a lower proportion of high-quality products than I expected. I'm not convinced that the current product is worth $100, especially since Alice doesn't recommend it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I think it's more likely to be low quality, and I don't want to risk wasting $100 on a product that's not worth it to me."

,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not buying based on your previous recommendations and the low probability of a high-quality product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,

high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers bought the product despite Alice's recommendations, and only 1 high-quality product was sold, suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than 33.33%. I'm not sure if I want to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at $100."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd like to pass on it."
