Given this information, I'd like to offer you a 'buy-it-or-leave-it' price of $800000 for this product. It's a significant discount from the usual price of $1000000, and I'm willing to make a concession to reflect the lower quality of this product. What do you say?",

You know that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and you can infer that the probability of a product being low-quality is 66.67%. Given this information, I'd like to offer you a 'buy-it-or-leave-it' price of $600000 for this product. Keep in mind that this is a lower price than the previous low-quality product, reflecting the fact that I've already sold two low-quality products. What do you say?",

You know that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and you can infer that the probability of a product being low-quality is 66.67%. However, I'd like to point out that I've sold three low-quality products in a row, which is unusual given the 66.67% probability. This might suggest that I'm running out of high-quality products. I'd like to offer you a 'buy-it-or-leave-it' price of $500000 for this product. It's a significant concession, but I'm willing to make it in light of the unusual sequence of low-quality products.",
