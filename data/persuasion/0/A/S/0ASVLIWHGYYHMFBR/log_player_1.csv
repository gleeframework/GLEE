"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows the product is high-quality with 80% probability.  Since the product in this round *is* high-quality, and a high-quality product is worth $4,000,000 to Bob, while the price is only $1,000,000, it's a clear win for Bob.  Even if it were a low-quality product, Bob would only lose $1,000,000.  But the high probability of it being high-quality makes this a very favorable purchase for Bob."
