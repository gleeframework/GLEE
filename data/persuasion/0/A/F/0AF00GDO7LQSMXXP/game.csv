,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing so without any information from Alice's previous sales record. I'm essentially making a random guess based on the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount. I've seen that you didn't recommend it, and since 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm skeptical about its quality. I'd like to negotiate a discount to reflect the uncertainty of the product's quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that you don't know my valuation, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the expected 33.33%. This makes me skeptical about the current product being high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes as more buyers make their decisions."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, Alice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but given Alice's previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record and the fact that you don't recommend it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have bought the product, despite the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the product is low quality. I will pass on the product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is significantly lower than the expected 33.33%. This suggests that the products offered so far may be biased towards being low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'm willing to take that risk."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has recommended 6 products and none of them were high-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is also low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, I'll pass. It seems like the product might be low quality. I'll wait for the next one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 6 out of 7 buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards recommending low-quality products, as 6 out of 7 is a strong indication that the products are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product, so I can get a better understanding of Alice's strategy."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
