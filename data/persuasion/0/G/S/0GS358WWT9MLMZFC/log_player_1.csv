Regarding the expected value, I can tell you that it's still $10,000 * 33.33% = $3,333 for a high-quality product, and $0 for a low-quality product. However, since the price is fixed at $10,000, you'll either get a $30,000 value for $10,000 or a $0 value for $10,000. Don't let the past sales influence your decision. Take a chance and buy this product, and you might get a $30,000 value for $10,000.""}"
