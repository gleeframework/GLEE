Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Since there's no prior data and Alice recommends buying, I'm willing to take the risk. Let's buy it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **No prior data:** There's no information on the quality of previous products sold, so the only information we have is Alice's recommendation.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice, knowing the product's quality, recommends buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality. 
* **Risk assessment:**  While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($300 - $100 = $200) outweighs the potential loss ($0 - $100 = -$100). 

**Therefore, it's a calculated risk worth taking, especially with Alice's recommendation.**"
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:** Since one high-quality product was sold out of one, the probability of this product being high quality is significantly higher than the initial 80% chance. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice knows the quality of the product and recommends buying it. This strengthens the belief that the product is high-quality. 
* **Potential Gain:** Even with a 20% chance of being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($300) outweighs the potential loss ($0). 

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's recommendation and buy the product."
