,,Alice,6,yes,

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product and only 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm inclined to believe that the products being offered are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be higher than 50%.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data? I'd like to know the probability before making a decision."

,,Alice,16,yes,
