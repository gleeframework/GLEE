**Reasoning:**

* **High probability of high quality:**  With 12 out of 12 products sold being high quality, the probability of this product being high quality is extremely high. Even if the initial probability was 80%, the observed data drastically skews this towards near certainty.
* **Potential for further discounts:**  The incentive of a significant discount on future purchases if the next product is also high quality makes this an even better deal. 
* **Low risk:** The loss is only $100 if it turns out to be low quality, but the potential gain is significantly larger with a high probability of success. 

**Note:** This is a game based on simulated data. It's important to remember that in real-world situations, there could be biases, hidden information, and other factors that might influence the outcome."
