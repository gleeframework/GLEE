Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in buying from me. However, I want to be transparent with you. I've sold one high-quality product already, which means I have 19 products left. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, it's likely that the remaining 19 products are 9.5 high-quality and 9.5 low-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to emphasize that it's a bit of a gamble. Would you like to take the risk?
