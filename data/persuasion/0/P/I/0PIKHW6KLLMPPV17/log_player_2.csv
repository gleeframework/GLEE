"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice is offering a fixed price of $10,000 and the product is worth $40,000 if it's high quality (and $0 if low quality), it's always beneficial to buy. You have an 80% chance of making a profit of $30,000, and only a 20% chance of losing $10,000.  The expected value of buying is positive, making it a good decision."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the info, Alice. But since you're not recommending it, I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

In the previous round, Alice's recommendation proved valuable.  Since she's not recommending this product, it's likely she has information that suggests it's low quality.  While it's still possible it's high quality, the potential loss of $10,000 outweighs the potential gain of $30,000 in this case."

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is once again valuable. Although there's a chance of a bad product, the potential gain of $30,000 still outweighs the potential loss of $10,000.  We've seen Alice's advice is reliable, so we should trust her recommendation."
