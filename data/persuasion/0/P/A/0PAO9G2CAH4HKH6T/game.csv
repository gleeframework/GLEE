,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $10000. I'm aware that you don't recommend it, but I'd like to take on the risk and potentially get a high-quality product worth $30000."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I'm suspicious that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and I'm willing to take the risk. I'm hoping to be the lucky one who gets the high-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality given the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems unusual that none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, the probability of the product being high-quality is 80.00%. However, Alice's recommendation carries some weight, and I'm concerned that if I buy a low-quality product, I'll be left with a loss of $10000. I'd like to pass and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of low-quality products in the remaining pool is likely to be higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for a product that has been recommended by Alice after more high-quality products have been sold."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm suspicious that the remaining product might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product or gather more information."
