Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the buyer doesn't have any information about the specific product's quality, they do know that 80% of Alice's products are high-quality. Given this information, and the fact that the buyer will be able to determine the product's quality after purchase, it's in the buyer's best interest to buy the product. 

Here's why:

* **Potential gain:**  If the product is high-quality, the buyer earns a profit of $1,000,000 (the difference between its worth to them and the selling price). 
* **Limited risk:**  If the product is low-quality, the buyer loses $1,000,000. However, the probability of this happening is only 20%.

The expected value of buying the product is positive, making it a reasonable gamble for the buyer."
