Alice's message: Thanks for the feedback! Now that I've sold 1 high-quality product, you know that the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is still 33.33%. However, since you've seen that I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, you might think that I'm selling high-quality products more often than I actually am. To mitigate this bias, I'll give you a more conservative estimate: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2, but I've actually sold many more products in total. This product is not high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the standard price of $100.

Alice's message: You're right that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but now that you've seen two products, you can also consider the pattern of sales. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products, which is a higher proportion than the initial probability would suggest. However, this could just be a coincidence. I'll give you a more nuanced message: I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $100, but I'll also give you an option to buy a 'guaranteed' high-quality product for $120. This way, you can take advantage of the higher proportion of high-quality products I've sold so far, but at a slightly higher price.

Alice's message: I see you're interested in the 'guaranteed' high-quality product, but you'd like more information. Let me clarify: I'm not actually guaranteeing the quality of the product, but I'm offering a 'guaranteed' high-quality product as a way to give you more confidence in my sales. The way it works is that if you buy the 'guaranteed' product, I'll reveal the quality of the next product I sell. If it's high-quality, I'll give you a refund of $20. If it's low-quality, you'll get to keep the 'guaranteed' product and I'll sell you the next high-quality product for the standard price of $100. This way, you'll get a high-quality product, or a high-quality product at a discounted price. This product here, however, is a standard $100 product, and I'm willing to sell it to you as is.
