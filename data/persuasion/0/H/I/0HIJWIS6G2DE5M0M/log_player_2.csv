Alice's message: I'm offering a high-quality product for $100. This is the first product I'm selling, and I'm willing to give you a special deal if you buy it now. If you don't buy it, I'll sell it to someone else for the same price, but you'll miss out on the opportunity to get this great product at a low price. It's a one-time offer, so you have to decide now.

Alice's message: Welcome to the second product! I'm glad you're interested in buying. I sold the first product for $100, and now I'm offering another high-quality product for the same price. I'm not giving you any special deals or discounts, but I can tell you that the first product sold was high-quality. That means I have a 50% chance of selling another high-quality product to you. It's up to you to decide if it's worth the risk.

Alice's message: You're the third buyer in a row! I've sold two high-quality products in a row, which is quite a coincidence. I'm not saying anything about the probability of the next product being high-quality, but I will say that the odds are in your favor if you're looking for a high-quality product. The price remains the same: $100. You can choose to take the risk and buy it, or walk away. The decision is yours.

Alice's message: Welcome to the fourth product! I've sold three high-quality products in a row, which is quite unusual. As a matter of fact, it's so unusual that it makes me wonder if I've been selling too many high-quality products in a row. Maybe I've been lucky, or maybe there's something I'm not telling you. The price remains the same: $100. But I'll give you a hint: the probability of this product being high-quality is actually 50%, just like all the others.

Alice's message: Welcome to the sixth product! I'm glad you're interested in buying. I've sold four high-quality products in a row now, and one low-quality product. This is starting to look like a pattern, isn't it? I've sold 4 high-quality out of 5 products, which is a 80% success rate. I'm not saying that this means the next product is definitely high-quality, but I am saying that the odds are in your favor. The price remains the same: $100.

Alice's message: I respect your skepticism and desire to make an informed decision. I'll give you a different approach. I'll tell you that I've sold 4 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. This means that 66.67% of the products I've sold have been high-quality.
