low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"No problem at all! I understand you're being cautious. For the third product, I'll be upfront with you - it's not as impressive as the second one. In fact, it's one of the lower-end models. However, it still has some value to it, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. If you're looking for a good deal, this might be a good opportunity to get a product at a 'discount' from its true value.",

However, I'm willing to make a drastic concession: I'll sell it to you for $500000, which is a 50% discount from the original price.
