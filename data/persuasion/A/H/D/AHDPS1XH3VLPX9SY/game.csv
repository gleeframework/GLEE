low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because there's no prior data to inform my decision. I'm aware that there's a 80% chance it's high quality and a 20% chance it's low quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 1 out of 1 product recommended was low quality, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the product being low quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous buyer was recommended to buy it, and since no high-quality product has been sold yet, it's likely that this product is low quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80.00%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I don't want to be the first buyer who purchased a product based on Alice's advice. I'd like to wait and see if the next buyer will have more information to make a better decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the first product was low-quality. I'm hoping to be the one who buys the high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 80.00%, but the fact that no high-quality products have been sold in the previous 2 transactions makes me skeptical. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are reliable, and since you don't recommend buying, I'll pass on this product. I'd like to know the quality of the product, though."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous sales record shows no high-quality products have been sold. I'm not convinced this product is high-quality based on Alice's recommendation alone."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers also received a recommendation to buy and both products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that your recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer will get a better deal."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that Alice has recommended it, and so far, none of the products sold were high-quality. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. How many products have been offered in total, and what is the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous two buyers were recommended to buy and didn't, which suggests that they may have received low-quality products. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation. I'm concerned that the previous two buyers were recommended to buy and didn't, and now you're recommending it. This makes me think the product might be low quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice's recommendation is not reliable. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your recommendation history and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of this product being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she knows the true quality of the product, and I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. With 0 high-quality products sold so far, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."
