low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as I don't have any information about the product's quality yet."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a product based solely on your recommendation, especially since I don't have any information about the product's quality. I'd like to wait and see how the next buyers react to their products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and no high-quality products sold yet. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products were low quality, I believe the probability of the product being high quality is low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Can you share the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the product's quality or the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend me to buy the product, and given that 3 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable enough to buy it, I'm going to pass on it. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall 50% chance, but I'm not convinced that this product is the one. I'll wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Are you basing it solely on the fact that all previous products were low quality?

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, and Alice recommended buying the product, I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality. I will pass on it."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product and would like to wait for a better opportunity."
