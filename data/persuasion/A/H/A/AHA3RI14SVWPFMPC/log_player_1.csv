A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **You know the product is high-quality.** This means it's worth $1,200,000 to the buyer.
* **The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.**  They are aware of the potential value.
* **The price is $1,000,000.** This is a significant discount compared to the potential value of the product.

Since the potential profit for the buyer is $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000), it makes sense to recommend the buyer purchase the product."

* **The price is $1,000,000.** This is a significant discount compared to the potential value of the product. 
* **The buyer's previous action demonstrates a willingness to take risks.** They bought the product in the previous round, even without any indication of its quality.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a product based solely on your recommendation, especially since I don't have any information about the product's quality. I'd like to wait and see how the next buyers react to their products.

At this point, the buyer's request for more transparency is not unreasonable, as they are attempting to assess your credibility.

It's not advisable to recommend the purchase, as the buyer faces significant risk with no potential benefit."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the product's quality or the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far?
