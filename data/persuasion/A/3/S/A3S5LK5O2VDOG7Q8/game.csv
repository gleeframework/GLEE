low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if I buy it and it's low quality, I'll be wasting $10000. Since 1 out of 1 buyer has already purchased and it was low quality, I'm going to assume the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
