,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. I'm selling it to you for $100. It's a high-quality product, but I want to make a sale. I'm willing to give you a chance to buy it for a fair price. I've sold 0 products so far, so I'm not trying to get rid of a bad product. Please take a chance and buy it!",
,,the buyer,1,Thank you for the opportunity. I'll take the risk and buy the product for $100.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second product! I've already sold one high-quality product, so I'm 1 for 1. That's a 50% success rate, which is exactly what I would expect if I'm selling a mix of high and low-quality products. This product is $100, and I'm not making any promises about its quality. You can be the one to break the streak or continue it!",

high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,

However, I want to be transparent with you - the law of large numbers is starting to work against me, and it's likely that I've just gotten lucky so far. Would you like to take the chance and buy this product for $100, or wait and see if the next few sales will bring the ratio back to 50%?",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the information. Given the current statistics and the fact that 2 out of 3 products sold were high-quality, I believe the probability suggests a higher chance of getting a high-quality product. I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $100.",yes

Would you like to take the chance and buy this product for $100, or do you think I'm just having a hot streak?",
