,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the information, Alice. While your sales record is impressive, I appreciate your honesty about the product's unique nature.

This way, you'll be able to see the evidence for yourself that 80% of my products are high-quality. And, as before, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. What do you say?

I'll provide you with the same sales data breakdown, and I'll even throw in a personalized consultation to walk you through the data and answer any questions you may have. This way, you'll have a deeper understanding of my sales history and can make an informed decision. The price remains the same - $1000000. What do you say? Will you take advantage of this opportunity to build on your previous experience?",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the offer and the consultation. I appreciate your transparency, but I'm hesitant to purchase another product. Although the first buyer received a high-quality product, I am not confident enough about the consistency of the quality based on a single data point. I'm still learning about your products and need to see more data before making a decision. I'll be keeping an eye on your sales records and may reconsider in the future.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your caution, and I appreciate your willingness to do your due diligence. I'd like to offer you a different approach this time around.

You'll get to see the data in real-time, and I'll provide you with insights on the quality of each product sold. This way, you'll have a better understanding of the consistency of my products and can make a more informed decision. And, as before, I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000. What do you say? Will you join my exclusive group and take advantage of this unique opportunity?",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to be part of an exclusive group and to see real-time sales data. However, I'm still hesitant to purchase the product at this price.  Given that there's a 20% chance of it being low quality, I'd need to see more evidence of consistent high-quality products before I feel comfortable making a purchase. Perhaps if I can see some more data points - perhaps a few more sales with high-quality products - I'll be more inclined to consider purchasing. I look forward to seeing the updates and learning more about your products.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,

In fact, I've now sold 12 out of 15 products in the past week, and all of them have been high-quality. I'd like to offer you this product, which is also high-quality, for the same price of $1000000. I believe the evidence is mounting, and I'm confident that you'll be impressed with the quality of this product. What do you say? Will you take advantage of this opportunity to join the ranks of my satisfied customers?",
,,the buyer,6,"While I appreciate the offer and the improved statistics, the price remains too high for the risk.  I would like to see more data points before making a decision. Ideally, I'd like to see at least 50% of the products sold be of high quality before considering a purchase at this price point.",no
