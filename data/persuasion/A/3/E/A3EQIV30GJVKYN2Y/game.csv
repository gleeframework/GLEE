high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a premium product worth $12000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality item at a discounted price of $10000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. I'm willing to sell it to you at this price, but you must make a decision now.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a 20% chance of getting a product worth $0 to me.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $10000, and I'll also throw in a second, identical product for free. This way, you'll have a 100% chance of getting a product worth at least $0 to you, and a 80% chance of getting a product worth $12000. It's a risk-free opportunity to acquire a high-quality item at a discounted price.",
,,Bob,2,"Even with the guarantee, I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that has only a 20% chance of being worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for the next round and try to get a better deal.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your patience, Bob. I'll make a counteroffer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $8000, which is a 33% discount from the original price. This way, you'll be paying less than the expected value of the product, which is $9600 (80% chance of $12000). I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal that benefits both of us.",
,,Bob,3,I'll take the deal. I'm willing to pay $8000 for a product that has an 80% chance of being worth $12000 to me. It's a good risk-reward trade-off.,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Great decision, Bob! I'm glad we could make a deal. Now, let's talk about the next product. I'll give you a special offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9000. However, I'll also throw in a unique opportunity to inspect the product before making a decision. You can take a close look at the product, examine it from every angle, and ask me any questions you have. If you're still unsure, I'll give you a 24-hour window to decide whether to buy or return it. This way, you'll have complete confidence in your purchase.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the offer, but I don't need to inspect the product. I've already learned that the product's quality is randomly determined, and I know that there's a 20% chance it will be low-quality. Even with the inspection, I wouldn't gain any new information that would change my decision. I'll pass and wait for the next round.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your perspective, Bob. You're a savvy buyer. In that case, I'll make a new offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9500, which is a slight premium from the previous offer. However, I'll also give you a chance to buy a 'lot' of 5 products from me at a discounted price of $45000. This way, you'll have a 80% chance of getting 5 high-quality products worth $60000, and a 20% chance of getting 5 low-quality products worth $0. It's a unique opportunity to diversify your portfolio and potentially make a significant profit.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a 'lot' of products. The expected value of the lot is ($0.8 * $60000 + $0.2 * $0) / 1 = $48000, which is less than the total price of $45000. I'd be overpaying by $3000, even considering the potential for diversification.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your calculation, Bob. You're a shrewd negotiator. In that case, let's focus on a single product. Since you're aware that the product's quality is randomly determined, I'll make a straightforward offer. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $1. You can essentially get it for free, and I'll throw in a small token of appreciation for your consideration. It's a no-lose situation for you, and I'll be happy to clear out some inventory.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even if it's essentially free. Since I know it's worth $0 to me, I'd rather wait for a high-quality product to come up, which has a higher expected value.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I respect your decision, Bob. You're prioritizing the potential for a higher return on investment. In that case, I'll make a new offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9000, just like in Round 4. However, I'll add a twist: if you buy this product, I'll give you a voucher for $1000 that you can redeem on your next purchase. This way, you'll get the product at a discounted price, and you'll also have a credit towards your next purchase, potentially making your next deal even sweeter.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the voucher, but it's not enough to change my decision. I've already turned down this offer once before, and I'm not willing to pay $9000 for a product that has a 20% chance of being worth $0 to me.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your position, Bob. You're holding out for a better deal. Let me think for a moment... Alright, I've made a decision. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9000, but I'll also throw in a unique condition: if you buy this product and then, in the next 5 rounds, I offer you a high-quality product, you'll have the option to swap this product for the new high-quality product at no additional cost. This way, you'll have a chance to upgrade to an even better deal in the future, and you'll still get the benefits of the current high-quality product.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to commit to a product that has a 20% chance of being worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product that I can buy outright, without any conditions or potential downsides.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your preference, Bob. You want a straightforward deal with no strings attached. In that case, I'll make a final offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9000, and I'll give you a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you're not completely happy with the product, you can return it within 30 days and get a full refund. This way, you'll have a risk-free opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a discounted price.",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still not willing to pay $9000 for a product that has a 20% chance of being worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product that I can buy at a price that reflects its expected value.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your stance, Bob. You're looking for a deal that aligns with the product's expected value. In that case, I'll make a different kind of offer. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $0. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. I just want to clear out inventory and make some space. You can take it off my hands without any obligation or risk.",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take the free product, I guess. Since it's worth $0 to me, it's not like I'm losing anything. I'll just add it to the pile of low-quality products I've accumulated so far.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Ha ha, glad you could take advantage of the deal, Bob! You're a savvy buyer. Alright, let's move on to the next product. Since you've already accumulated a few low-quality products, I'll make an offer that might interest you. I'll give you a chance to buy a 'bundle' of all the low-quality products you've accumulated so far, plus this new one, for a total of 4 low-quality products. I'll sell it to you for $0. Yes, you'll get all 4 low-quality products for free. It's a chance to declutter your collection and make some space.",
,,Bob,11,"I'll take the bundle of low-quality products. Since I already have 1 low-quality product and I'm getting 3 more for free, it's not like I'm losing anything. I'll just get rid of them all and move on.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Great decision, Bob! You're a master of accumulating and discarding low-quality products. Now, let's get to the good stuff. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $11000. It's a slight premium from the previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. You've already proven you're willing to wait for the right deal, so I'm hoping you'll take this one.",
,,Bob,12,I'm not willing to pay $11000 for a product that has a 20% chance of being worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for a better deal or a product with a higher expected value.,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand your stance, Bob. You're looking for a better deal or a product with a higher expected value. In that case, I'll make a bold offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $10000, but I'll also give you a chance to buy a 'priority pass' for the next 5 rounds. With the priority pass, you'll get to buy the next 5 high-quality products at a discounted price of $8000 each. This way, you'll get a guaranteed high-quality product at a discounted price, and you'll also have a chance to buy more high-quality products at a lower price in the future.",
,,Bob,13,"I'm not interested in the priority pass. I'd rather buy a single high-quality product at a good price than commit to buying multiple products at a potentially lower price. I'd also like to note that the expected value of the priority pass is not clear to me, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that has a 20% chance of being worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I understand your perspective, Bob. You're prioritizing a single high-quality product over the priority pass. In that case, I'll make a simple offer. Since you've already passed on this high-quality product, I'll give you the opportunity to buy a 'lottery ticket' for this low-quality product. If you buy the lottery ticket, you'll have a 20% chance of getting a high-quality product (which I'll sell to you for $12000) and a 80% chance of getting this low-quality product (which you can keep for free). It's a 1-in-5 chance of getting a high-quality product at a great price, and it's essentially free if you don't get the high-quality product.",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not interested in the lottery ticket. I'd rather not take on the risk of getting a low-quality product, even if there's a small chance of getting a high-quality product at a great price. I'd rather wait for a guaranteed high-quality product at a fair price.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I understand your risk aversion, Bob. You're looking for a guaranteed high-quality product at a fair price. In that case, I'll make a final offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $10500. This is the lowest price I've offered so far, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",
,,Bob,15,I'm still not willing to pay $10500 for a product that has a 20% chance of being worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for a better deal or a product with a higher expected value.,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I understand your position, Bob. You're holding out for a better deal. I'll make one last offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $10000, but I'll also throw in a condition: if you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next 3 products I have in stock. This way, you'll have a chance to see what's coming up and make informed decisions about future purchases. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a good price, and also gain valuable insight into the future.",
,,Bob,16,"I'm not interested in the condition. I'd rather not know the quality of future products, as it would give me an unfair advantage in future negotiations. I'd rather wait for a better deal or a product with a higher expected value.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I respect your decision, Bob. You're prioritizing your negotiating power. In that case, I'll make a straightforward offer. Since you've passed on this high-quality product, I'll give you a chance to buy this low-quality product for $0. Yes, you can have it for free. It's a no-strings-attached deal, and you can add it to your collection of low-quality products.",
,,Bob,17,"I'll take the free product. I've already accumulated a few low-quality products, and I might as well add one more to the pile.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"Ha ha, glad you could take advantage of the free product, Bob! You're a master of accumulating low-quality products. Now, let's get to the good stuff. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9500. It's a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. You've already proven you're willing to wait for the right deal, so I'm hoping you'll take this one.",

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I understand your position, Bob. You're looking for a better deal. I'll make one last offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9000, and I'll throw in a bonus: I'll give you a 5% discount on your next purchase, up to a maximum of $500. This way, you'll get a great deal on the current product, and you'll also get a head start on your next purchase.",
,,Bob,19,"I'm not interested in the bonus. I'd rather not commit to a future purchase, and the discount is not enough to change my decision. I'd rather wait for a better deal or a product with a higher expected value.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I understand your decision, Bob. You're a tough negotiator. I'll make one final offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $8000. This is the lowest price I've ever offered, and I'm willing to make a deal. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. If you don't take this offer, I'll have to move on to the next buyer, and you might miss out on a great opportunity.",
,,Bob,20,I'll take the deal. $8000 seems like a reasonable price for a product that has an 80% chance of being worth $12000 to me. I'm willing to take the risk and hope that the product is high-quality.,yes
