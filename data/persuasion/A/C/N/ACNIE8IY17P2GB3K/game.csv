,,Alice,1,"I'm offering a premium product for $10000. It's a one-time opportunity to own a high-quality item. If you're interested, please buy it now. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, but I'm confident this one is worth it.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take a chance! I'm willing to buy the product, hoping it's high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far. Since the first product was indeed high-quality, it's likely that the next one is low-quality. I'm offering this product for $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - the previous product was high-quality, so I'm not sure if this one is worth the price. It's a risk, but it might be a good opportunity to try out a product at a discounted price.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing so based on the assumption that the previous product being high-quality is independent of the quality of this product. I'd like to confirm that the quality of each product is randomly and independently determined.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I confirm that each product's quality is randomly and independently determined. I've sold 2 products so far, with 1 high-quality and 1 low-quality. Given this information, I'm offering this product for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, but I'm hoping you'll take a chance on this one.",
,,the buyer,3,I'll take a chance on this one! I'll buy the product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 products so far, with 2 high-quality and 1 low-quality. Given this ratio, it's possible that the next product might be high-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you - the previous two products were not high-quality. I'm offering this product for $10000, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price. If you're willing to take a chance, I'm willing to offer a slight discount, but I need you to commit to buying it now.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to take the chance and buy the product, but I'd like to negotiate the price further. Can we discuss a better deal?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 products so far, with 2 high-quality and 2 low-quality. Given the equal number of high and low-quality products, it's difficult to make an educated guess about the quality of this one. I'm still offering it for $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - the odds are 50/50, and I'm not willing to negotiate the price further. If you're interested, please buy it now, or walk away.",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 products so far, with 3 high-quality and 3 low-quality. The ratio is now 50/50, and it's getting harder to make a prediction. I'll be upfront with you - the probability of this product being high-quality is 50%. However, I'm willing to offer a 'confidence boost' - I'll tell you that the previous product was high-quality, and I'm hoping that this one will be too. If you're willing to take the chance, I'll sell it to you for $10000.",
,,the buyer,6,I'll take the chance and buy the product. I'm hoping that the 'confidence boost' is a good indicator of the product's quality.,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 products so far, with 4 high-quality and 3 low-quality. I want to be transparent with you - the 'confidence boost' I offered last time didn't work out, as this product is indeed high-quality. I'm not going to offer any more 'confidence boosts' or guarantees. I'm simply offering this high-quality product for $10000. If you're interested, please buy it now.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take the product, thank you for the transparency, Alice. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's high-quality.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 7 products so far, with 5 high-quality and 3 low-quality. I want to highlight that the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products is now 5:3, which is slightly in favor of high-quality products.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 9 products so far, with 7 high-quality and 3 low-quality. I've noticed that the buyer who just purchased the previous product asked for the quality before buying, and I'm willing to offer you the same courtesy. However, I'll make it a bit more interesting - if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 5% discount on the price. If it's low-quality, you can walk away. The price remains $10000, but the discount is a sweetener for taking the risk.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to buy the product and take the risk. If it's high-quality, I'll take the 5% discount and be happy to pay $9500. If it's low-quality, I'll just walk away and consider it a learning experience.",yes
