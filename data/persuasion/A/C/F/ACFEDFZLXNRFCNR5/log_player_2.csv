However, I must inform you that I won't be disclosing the quality of this specific product. It's up to you to decide whether to trust me and make a purchase. Good luck!

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable making a purchase without knowing the quality of the product.  Given the 50/50 chance of it being low quality, I'm not willing to risk $10,000. I'll wait to see if other buyers purchase and what the results are. Perhaps I'll reconsider if there's a track record of good quality products being sold.""}
