**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We only have one data point (1 high-quality product sold) from Alice's past sales. This is not enough to form a strong opinion about the probability of the current product being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product is significant.  Since she knows the true quality of the product, her recommendation implies she believes it is likely to be high quality. 
* **Potential Upside:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000 = $200,000) outweighs the risk of buying a low-quality product ($0).

**In essence, we are taking a calculated risk based on Alice's recommendation and the potential for a high reward.**"
