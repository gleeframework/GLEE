I'll be transparent with you: I've sold 3 products so far, and 1 has been high-quality. The other 2 are low-quality, and you're looking at one of them right now. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is a low-quality one. But I'm still willing to let it go for $10000. It's a chance to get a product at a very low price, even if it's not the best quality.

Alice's message: You're a numbers person, I like that. Let's talk about the probability. With 1 high-quality product out of 4, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually 50%, just like the overall probability. But I'll give you a different perspective: I've sold 4 products, and 3 of them have been low-quality. That means the next product has a 75% chance of being high-quality. It's a bit of a contrarian play, but I think it's worth considering. And remember, I'm still offering the 'buyer's insurance' - if you buy and it's low-quality, you get a full refund.

Alice's message: You're a contrarian buyer, and I respect that. Unfortunately, it looks like the contrarian approach didn't pay off this time. The product is low-quality, and you get to enjoy the 'buyer's insurance' I offered earlier. Don't worry, you'll get a full refund of $10000. Let's update the numbers: 5 products offered, 2 high-quality, 3 low-quality. 2 buyers have purchased products, and 3 buyers have passed on the product. I'm starting to think I need to change my strategy. How about this: I'll give you a'reverse guarantee'. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a bonus of $5000 on top of the $10000 price. That way, you'll get a great deal either way.
