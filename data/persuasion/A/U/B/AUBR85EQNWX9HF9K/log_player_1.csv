I believe this product is a great opportunity to take a chance on a high-quality item. What do you say? Are you willing to take a chance on this product?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take a chance on the product, but I'd like to know, have you considered the fact that the probability of a high-quality product is actually higher than 12.5%? Given that 2 buyers passed on the product before me, and only 1 high-quality product was sold, it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. This means the probability of a high-quality product is actually higher than 1/8, since the low-quality products are more likely to have been sold already.
