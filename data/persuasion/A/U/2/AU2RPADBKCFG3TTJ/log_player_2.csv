Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in buying. I'll give you an update on my sales record: out of 2 products sold so far, 1 was high-quality and 1 was low-quality. The proportion of low-quality products sold is 50%. However, I'd like to point out that this is not a representative sample, and the overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. The price is $1000000.
