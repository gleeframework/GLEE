,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide me with the price of $500000. I'm willing to take a risk, but I'm not willing to pay the full $1000000 for a product that has a 50% chance of being low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the previous two buyers not buying. I'm not convinced that the product is low quality, and I think the odds are still in my favor."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to come up."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I don't have any information to go on and I'm not being recommended to buy it. I'm doing this to see if Alice's recommendation is accurate and to get a better understanding of the product's quality."
