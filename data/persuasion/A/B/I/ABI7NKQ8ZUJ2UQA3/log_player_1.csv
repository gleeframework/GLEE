"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality in this round, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, recommending a purchase is the optimal strategy.  Bob has a 50% chance of getting a good deal (if it's worth more to him than $10,000) and a 50% chance of getting a bad deal (if it's worth less to him than $10,000). However, without knowing Bob's value for the product, we can't definitively say it's a ""good"" deal for him."
