,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not taking your recommendation into account. I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality and its value to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the average, and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm going to take the risk, Alice! I'll buy it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product's quality based on the previous sales?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that I know the probability of the product being high quality is 33.33%, but I also know that no high-quality products have been sold so far. This could be due to the fact that all the previous buyers were recommended not to buy, and therefore the remaining products are more likely to be high quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'll pass on it. This suggests that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to risk wasting my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 products were low quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered is likely to be low quality, and I don't want to risk wasting my $1000000."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to know the updated statistics before making a decision."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 7 buyers have passed on the product, and none of the high-quality products have been sold yet, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying, I'll pass on this product. If you don't recommend it, it's likely to be a low-quality product, so I'll save my $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 7 buyers have purchased the products so far and none of them were high-quality, I suspect that the products being offered are mostly low-quality.
