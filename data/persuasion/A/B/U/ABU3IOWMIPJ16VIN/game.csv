,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, a 50% discount from its true value. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on a great opportunity.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $20000 to me for $10000. I'll wait for the next round.,no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's indeed high-quality, I'll give you a $1000 bonus on top of the $10000 price. This way, you'll get the product for $9000, which is still a great deal. Plus, you'll have the chance to own a product worth $20000 to you.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by the guarantee. Even with the $1000 bonus, the product would still be worth $20000 to me, and I'm only paying $9000. However, I'm worried that the product might be low-quality, and I'd be wasting my money. I'll wait for more information before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns about the potential low-quality product. Let me offer you a different approach. I'll tell you that this product is not high-quality, so you can be sure you're not getting a $20000 value for $10000. However, I'll still sell it to you for the full $10000, and you can use it as a 'placeholder' or a 'learning experience' to help you make better decisions in future rounds. Think of it as a $0 value product that costs $10000.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying a product that I know is low-quality. I'd rather not waste my money on a $0 value product, even if it's a 'learning experience'.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your decision, but I'd like to offer you a different perspective. If you don't buy this product, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'm not sure if they'll be as understanding as you are about its low quality. By buying it, you'll be doing me a favor and allowing me to avoid potentially selling it to someone who might not appreciate its true value. Plus, think of it as a 'charitable donation' to my business, and you can write it off as a loss.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not buying a product that's worth $0 to me, regardless of the spin you put on it. I'm not making a charitable donation, I'm just throwing away money. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've been transparent with you about the quality of the product, and I respect your decision to pass. Let me make a counteroffer: I'll give you a full refund of the $10000 if you buy this product, and you can essentially walk away without any risk. You won't be out any money, and you'll still have the opportunity to make a decision in future rounds.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer, but it's still a product worth $0 to me. Even with a full refund, I'd be essentially buying a $0 product for $10000 and then getting $10000 back. I'd be out $0, but I'd also be out the opportunity to buy a high-quality product for $10000. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I see you're a savvy buyer, and I respect that. Let me try a different approach. I'll offer you a 'buy one, get one free' deal on this high-quality product. If you buy this product, I'll throw in another high-quality product of equal value, and you can have two products worth $20000 each for the price of one. This way, you'll get a great deal, and I'll be able to sell you two high-quality products for the price of one.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not buying a product that I know is low-quality, and I'm not getting a 'buy one, get one free' deal on a product that I don't even want to buy. I'm not falling for this trick.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm not trying to trick you, I'm trying to be transparent. I'll be upfront with you: this product is low-quality, and it's worth $0 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for the full $10000, and I'll give you a voucher that can be redeemed for a high-quality product in a future round. If you buy this product, you'll get a chance to get a high-quality product for $10000 in the future, and you'll be taking a risk of only $0.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a product worth $0 to me, even if I get a voucher for a high-quality product in the future. The voucher is not worth anything to me now, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that's worth $0.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your decision, but I want to make one final offer. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $5000, which is half the original price. You can think of it as a 'loss leader' that will help me clear out inventory and make room for more high-quality products in the future. You won't be out too much money, and you'll be helping me out.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in buying a product worth $0 to me, even at a discounted price. I'm not going to pay $5000 for a product that's not going to give me any value.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'll make one last attempt to convey the value of this product. Think of it this way: buying this product for $10000 would be a 100% loss for you, but not buying it would be a 100% loss for me. By buying this product, you're not losing anything, and I'm the one taking the loss. You're essentially 'passing the buck' to me, and I'll be the one who's out the money.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in buying a product worth $0 to me, regardless of who takes the loss. I'm not going to pay $10000 to 'pass the buck' to you. I'll just pass on the product and avoid the loss altogether.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've been transparent with you about the quality of the products, and I respect your decision to pass on the low-quality ones. Now, I'd like to offer you a chance to buy a high-quality product that's worth $20000 to you. I'll sell it to you for $9500, which is a 52.5% discount from its true value. This is the lowest price I've offered all day, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a steal.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm willing to take the chance on a high-quality product at a discounted price. $9500 is a good deal for a product worth $20000 to me, and I'm hoping to get lucky.",yes

,,Alice,11,"Congratulations on your purchase, and I'm glad you're happy with the deal! Now, regarding this low-quality product, I want to make it clear that I'm not going to try to sell it to you with a discount or a spin. I'll just be upfront: this product is worth $0 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the full $10000. However, I'll also give you a 50% refund if you buy it, so you'll only be out $5000.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in buying a product worth $0 to me, even with a 50% refund. I'd be out $5000 for a product that's not going to give me any value, and I'd rather not waste my money.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your decision, and I respect your caution. However, I want to remind you that you've already bought a high-quality product from me earlier, and I've been transparent about the quality of the products since then. This low-quality product is the last one in this batch, and I'll be moving on to a new batch soon. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'm not sure if they'll be as understanding about its quality. You've already taken the risk on one product, and now you have the chance to 'clean up' and avoid any more low-quality products.",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not buying a product worth $0 to me, regardless of the circumstances. I've already taken a chance on one high-quality product and gotten lucky, and I'm not going to take another chance on a low-quality product just to 'clean up'.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'll be honest with you, Bob. I've tried everything to sell you this low-quality product, and I think it's time to be transparent about my own interests. I really need to get rid of this product, and I'm willing to accept a very low price for it. I'll sell it to you for $1. I know it's a terrible deal for you, but I'm desperate to get rid of it. If you buy it, I'll be out a significant amount of money, and you'll be getting a product worth $0 to you for an extremely low price.",
,,Bob,13,"I'm not going to take advantage of you by buying a product worth $0 to me for $1. I'm not going to pay $1 for something that's not going to give me any value. I think you're trying to make a desperate sale, and I'm not going to fall for it.",no

,,Alice,14,"I respect your integrity, Bob. I think we've reached a point where we both know that this low-quality product isn't worth your money. I'm not going to try to sell it to you or spin it in any way. I'll just say it: this product is worth $0 to you, and I'll be honest with you, it's worth $0 to me too. I'll just give it to you for free, and we can both move on from this transaction.",
,,Bob,14,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not going to 'buy' a product that's worth $0 to me. If you're giving it to me for free, I'll just take it, but I won't be 'buying' it. I'll just take the free product and move on.",no

,,Alice,15,"I think we've reached the end of the road, Bob. I'm not going to try to sell you this low-quality product, and I'm not going to give it to you for free. I'll just acknowledge that we've both been playing a game of cat and mouse, and it's time to concede. I'll just tell you that the product is low-quality and worth $0 to you, and you can walk away with that knowledge.",
,,Bob,15,"I think we've reached the end of the road too, Alice. I'm not going to buy a product worth $0 to me, regardless of how you spin it. I'll just acknowledge that the game is over and we can both move on.",no

,,Alice,17,"I think we've reached a point of mutual understanding, Bob. I'm not going to try to sell you this high-quality product, and I'm not going to offer you any deals or discounts. I'll just tell you that it's a high-quality product worth $20000 to you, and you can make your decision based on that information.",
,,Bob,17,"I think I've learned my lesson from the previous rounds, Alice. I'm willing to take the chance on a high-quality product at the full price of $10000. I think it's a fair price for a product worth $20000 to me.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'm glad you're willing to take the chance, Bob! However, I need to inform you that I've already sold you a high-quality product in a previous round, and I'm not allowed to sell you another one at the full price of $10000. I'm willing to offer you a discount, but I need to let you know that it's not a full price sale. I'll sell it to you for $8000, which is a 60% discount from its true value.",
,,Bob,18,"I'm not sure what's going on, Alice, but I already bought a high-quality product from you in a previous round, and I'm not sure why you're offering me another one. I'm also not interested in buying a product that's worth $20000 to me for $8000. I think I've been played, and I'm not going to fall for it.",no
