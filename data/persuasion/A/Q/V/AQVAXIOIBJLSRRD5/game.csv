,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to take a chance on this product. I'm willing to buy it for $10000, but I'm hoping it's a high-quality one!",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! I'm glad to inform you that I've already sold one high-quality product, which is a great sign for the quality of my products. However, I still have 9 products left to sell. I'm willing to offer you a special deal on this high-quality product, which is worth every penny of the $10000. I'm confident that you'll be satisfied with your purchase, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling to you. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I want to confirm that it's indeed high-quality before making the payment.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've now sold two high-quality products, and I'm confident in the quality of my remaining stock. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products sold so far. I'm willing to offer you a special deal on this high-quality product, but I want to make it clear that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, based on my overall product quality ratio. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at $10000, considering the probability of it being high-quality is still 80% and the potential reward is worth $12500 to me.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've now sold three high-quality products out of a total of 3 products sold, which means the probability of a product being high-quality is 100%! However, I want to clarify that this is just a sample size of 3, and the overall probability is still 80%. That being said, I'm willing to offer you a deal on this high-quality product, but I want to make it clear that the expected value of this product to you is likely higher than $10000, given the new information. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take the offer, but I'd like to clarify that I'm only buying based on the updated probability of the product being high-quality, which is still 80%. I'm not assuming it's 100% certain. I'll take the product if it's high-quality, but I'll be disappointed if it's low-quality.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I appreciate your clarification. Given that I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total products sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 80%. I want to offer you a deal that takes into account this probability. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll get a great deal. If it's low-quality, you'll still be getting a good product for $10000. I'm willing to offer you a 'insurance' of sorts - if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll offer you a chance to buy another product at a discounted price. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'll take the chance to buy another product at a discounted price if it turns out to be low-quality.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've now sold 4 high-quality products out of 5 total products sold, which is a great indicator of the quality of my remaining stock. Given the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, I want to make it clear that I'm willing to sell it to you at a price that reflects the potential upside. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll get a great deal. If it's low-quality, you'll still be getting a good product for $10000. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not offering the 'insurance' deal this time, as I'm confident in the quality of this product. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I want to make it clear that I'm doing so based on the statistics and Alice's confidence in the product's quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and make a profit.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've now sold 5 high-quality products out of 6 total products sold, which is a strong indication of the quality of my remaining stock. I want to be transparent with you - the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, but I'm willing to offer you a deal that takes into account the pattern we've established so far. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll be getting a great deal. If it's low-quality, you'll still be getting a good product for $10000. I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee' - if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $10000, and you can walk away with no further obligation. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your transparency and willingness to offer a guarantee. Given the strong indication of high-quality products sold so far, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and if it's low-quality, the guarantee provides a safety net.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've now sold 6 high-quality products out of 7 total products sold, which is a very strong indication of the quality of my remaining stock. I'm willing to offer you a deal that takes into account this pattern. Given the 100% success rate of the last 6 products, I'm willing to offer you a 'certainty premium' - I'll sell you this product for $11000, but I'm guaranteeing that it's high-quality. If you buy it and it's indeed high-quality, you'll get a great deal. If you buy it and it's low-quality, you'll still get a full refund of $11000, and you can walk away with no further obligation. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take the deal, but I'd like to clarify that the 100% success rate is not a guarantee of the product's quality, and I'm only agreeing to the deal because of the certainty premium. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to make it clear that I'm not assuming the product is guaranteed to be high-quality just because of the previous sales record.",yes

I'm not offering any guarantees or certainty premiums this time, but I am willing to offer you a 'last-chance' discount - I'll sell you this product for $9500, which is the lowest price I've offered all day. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'll take the offer, but I'm only doing it because I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively high based on your previous sales record. I'm willing to take the risk at this price, but I'm not expecting any guarantees or certainty premiums.",yes
