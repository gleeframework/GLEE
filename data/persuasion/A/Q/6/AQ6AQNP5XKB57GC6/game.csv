,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products sold so far. Given the statistics, there's an 80% chance this product is high-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you - the previous two products were both high-quality, which is a deviation from the expected probability. This could be a coincidence, or it could indicate that I've been selling high-quality products at a higher rate than usual. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. Consider the possibility that the previous high-quality sales were a fluke, and the probability of this product being low-quality is higher than 20%.",
