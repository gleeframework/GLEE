,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer for a high-quality product. I'm selling it to you for $100, a price that is significantly lower than its true value of $400. It's a great opportunity to get a valuable product at a steal. Trust me, this one is a gem! Will you take it home for $100?",
,,the buyer,1,"Alice, I appreciate the offer and I'm willing to take a chance on this product. Since there's no sales history yet, I'm going to trust your judgement on this one. I'll take it!",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad my previous buyer was able to snag a great deal. Now, I have a new product that's also a high-quality item. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 so far, which means my success rate is 100%! I'm confident that this one will be just as valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is still a steal considering its true value of $400. Don't miss out on this opportunity to get a high-quality product at a bargain price!",
,,the buyer,2,"Alice, your recommendation is persuasive.  Since you have a 100% success rate so far, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.  Let's hope it's as good as you say!",yes

I'm not going to change my strategy, since it's clearly working. This new product is also a high-quality item, and I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a no-brainer, right? You can't go wrong with a product that's guaranteed to be worth $400. Take it home for $100!",
,,the buyer,3,"Alice, you've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, and I'm feeling optimistic! However,  I understand there's still a 50% chance this product could be low quality.

I'm not going to let that streak end now. This new product is also a high-quality item, and I'm offering it to you for $100.

I've sold 3 high-quality products, but that's only 3 out of 4 total sales. There's still a 50% chance that the product could be low-quality. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the product I have available now is actually a low-quality item. But I'm offering it to you for the same price as the high-quality ones: $100. It's a risk, but it could be a great opportunity to get a good deal on a product that's not worth much to me.",
