  ""message"": ""I've sold 1 product so far, and I'm not sure if it's a good indicator of the quality of the products I have available. However, I want to be transparent with you - the fact that the first product sold was high-quality might suggest that the next one could be low-quality. On the other hand, it's also possible that the first product was just a fluke. I'm selling this one for $100, and I'm open to your decision.""
}"

Don't let this one product fool you, though - it's possible that it's just a one-off. The law of large numbers is starting to kick in, and we're getting a more representative sample of the overall quality distribution. I'm selling this one for $100, and I'm curious to see if you'll take the chance.""
