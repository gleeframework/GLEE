Round 8

It's not bad, but it's not great either. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that it's not a game-changer like the previous three products.

Round 10
Alice's message: Alright, alright, Bob. I get it. You're a tough nut to crack, and I respect that. But let me ask you this: what if I told you that this product is a 'learning experience'? It's not the best, but it's a chance to learn what you really need and what you're willing to pay for. And who knows, you might even find a way to make it work for you. It's not a waste of money, it's an investment in your own education. So, are you willing to take a chance on something that might not be the best, but could still be valuable to you?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the creative spin, Alice, but I'm not buying it. Literally.

It's taking up space in my warehouse, and I'd rather get some cash for it than have it collect dust. So, if you're feeling charitable, you could take it off my hands. But if you're not, I understand, and I'll just have to find another way to get rid of it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, Alice.
