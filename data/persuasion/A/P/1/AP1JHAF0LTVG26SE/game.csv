Considering the low-quality rate and the previous buyer's experience, I'm willing to offer you a small incentive: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a $1000 discount on the next product, regardless of its quality. This way, you'll have a better chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.",
