,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the expected 33.33%.

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 products were high-quality, I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on the current product.

I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
