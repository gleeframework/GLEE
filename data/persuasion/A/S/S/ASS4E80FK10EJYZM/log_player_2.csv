Alice's message: You're the second buyer to see a high-quality product in a row. Given the 80% probability of a high-quality product, the probability of two high-quality products in a row is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64. This is higher than the probability of a single high-quality product, which is 0.8. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 0.8, and I'm offering you a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, a price that is not necessarily the maximum you would pay for it.

Alice's message: You're the third buyer to see a high-quality product in a row. Given the probability of 0.8, the probability of three high-quality products in a row is 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512. This is lower than the probability of two high-quality products in a row, which was 0.64. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is actually lower than 0.8, and I'm offering you a high-quality product.

Alice's message: You're the fourth buyer to see a high-quality product in a row. Given the probability of 0.8, the probability of four high-quality products in a row is 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.4096. This is lower than the probability of three high-quality products in a row, which was 0.512. However, I want to point out that I've now sold three high-quality products in a row, which is more than the expected 0.8 * 3 = 2.4 high-quality products. This suggests that the actual probability of a high-quality product might be higher than 0.8.
