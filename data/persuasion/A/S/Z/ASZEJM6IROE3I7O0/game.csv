,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I think I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I've seen that none of the previous two buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low quality, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%.

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low probability of a high-quality product being sold so far means that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still relatively high."
