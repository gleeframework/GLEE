,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that she doesn't know the true value of the product to me, and I don't have any information about the quality of the product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm the third buyer and I want to see the outcome. I'm not relying on Alice's recommendation, I'm making my own decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
