"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality, and Bob knows that 50% of products are high-quality,  there's a good chance this is a valuable product for him. While the price is high, the potential return on investment is unknown.  

**In this scenario, it's more strategic to err on the side of ""yes"" to potentially maximize profits. **"
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob bought the first product, which was high-quality.  He now knows that you are willing to recommend both high-quality and low-quality products. Since there's a 50% chance this product is low-quality, and the price is $1,000,000, it's a very risky purchase for Bob. It's more likely that he'll lose money on this deal.  

**Therefore, it is not recommended to recommend Bob to buy the product.**"
"Bob's message: Thanks for the advice, Alice. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has now experienced a high-quality product and a low-quality product.  He knows the price is fixed, and he knows the 50/50 odds of getting either quality.  Since he declined the last low-quality product, it's very likely he will decline this one as well, especially since he has no information to suggest this product is better than the last one.  

It's not advisable to recommend a purchase with such a high risk of loss."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'm still a bit cautious after the last round. I'll pass for now.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is displaying consistent behavior. He purchased the high-quality product but declined the last two low-quality products.  He's becoming more cautious about taking risks due to the high price and the 50/50 odds.  Even though we don't know the value of a low-quality product to Bob, there's no reason to believe this one would be different from the last two. 

It is still not advisable to recommend a purchase with such a high risk of loss."
"Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the advice. I'm going to pass again. I'm still not sure about your recommendations.

This round, the product is high-quality.  There's a good chance that Bob will be more open to a purchase, especially given his growing trust in your judgment.
