,,Bob,4,"I understand the potential regret, but I'm making decisions based on probability, not emotions. Your assurance doesn't change the underlying probability of the product being high-quality, which remains 33.33%. I need more concrete evidence or a better offer to justify the risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've been thinking, and I want to share a pattern with you. In the past rounds, I've been trying to convey the quality of the products, but it seems like it hasn't been enough. I want to remind you that the price is non-negotiable, and I'm not willing to provide any additional information about the product's quality. Take that as you will.",

,,Bob,6,"You're right, Alice. I'm a savvy buyer who makes decisions based on probability. And the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm not feeling lucky enough to spend $1000000 on a gamble.",no
