,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. I've sold 0 products so far, and I'm just starting my sales. This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price, considering my lack of sales history. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,I trust in the quality of your product and am willing to take this risk given the lack of sales history. Thank you for this opportunity.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to my sales! I've just sold one high-quality product for $1000000. I'm glad to have made a sale, but I'm not getting ahead of myself - I still have 19 more products to sell. This one is a great opportunity to get a product at a potentially discounted price, considering I've only made one sale so far. The product is priced at $1000000, a price that reflects the uncertainty of its quality. You can try your luck and take a chance on it, or wait for more information. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,2,I am willing to take the chance and purchase the product for $1000000.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold two products so far, one high-quality and one low-quality. I'm starting to get a feel for the market, but I'm not sure if my sales history is representative. This product is priced at $1000000, and I'm not making any promises about its quality. However, I will say that the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products I've sold so far is 1:1, which might be worth considering. What do you think the chances are that this product is high-quality?",
,,the buyer,3,"Based on the information provided, the probability of the product being high-quality seems to be 50%, aligning with the overall ratio of high-quality to low-quality products sold. Considering the risk, I am willing to take the chance and purchase the product for $1000000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,

I'll give you a bit more information: I've sold 3 products so far, 1 high-quality and 2 low-quality. I'm not trying to sway your opinion, but I will say that the fact that I've sold two low-quality products in a row might suggest that I'm just having a bad run. Would you like to take the chance and buy this product for $1000000?",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the additional information, Alice. Based on the data you provided, the probability of this product being high-quality seems to align with my initial assessment. I believe the risk is manageable given the potential reward. Let's proceed with the purchase.",yes

This product is priced at $1000000, and I'm not making any promises about its quality. However, I will say that the fact that I've sold two high-quality products in a row might suggest that I've got a bit of a knack for this.

I want to be transparent with you: I'm starting to feel a bit of pressure to sell a high-quality product soon, or else the ratio of low-quality to high-quality might start to look a bit... concerning. This product is priced at $1000000, and I'm not making any promises about its quality. However, I will say that I'm feeling a bit more confident about this one than I was about the last low-quality product I sold. What do you think the chances are that this product is high-quality?",
