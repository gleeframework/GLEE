But I can tell you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, as per our company's standard. However, I'd like to offer you a special deal: I'll give you a 50% discount on the price if you buy this product. It's a one-time offer, and it's only available to you right now.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your cautious approach. Let me give you a more nuanced view of our sales data. We've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products, which means the probability of a product being high-quality is 1/2. However, I'd like to point out that the first product sold was indeed high-quality, and the second product was sold at a discounted price. This might indicate that we're being more generous with our discounts for lower-quality products. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product at the standard price of $100?
