low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. If you buy it, you'll get a low-quality item for $100. I'm willing to give you a 50% chance of getting a high-quality item in the next round if you don't buy this one.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in the current product, but I'd like to take the offer of a 50% chance of getting a high-quality item in the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You passed on the last low-quality item and now you have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality item in the next round. If you buy this low-quality item, I'll give you a 66.67% chance of getting a high-quality item in the next round. It's a 33.33% chance of getting a low-quality item in the next round, just like this one.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in the current low-quality item, I'll wait for the potential high-quality item in the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're on a roll! You've now passed on two low-quality items and have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality item in the next round. If you buy this low-quality item, I'll give you a 75% chance of getting a high-quality item in the next round. It's a 25% chance of getting a low-quality item in the next round, and you'll be out of the chance for a high-quality item in the next round if you buy this one.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in the current low-quality item, I'll wait for the potentially higher chance of a high-quality item in the next round.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Congratulations, you've finally got a high-quality item! This one is worth $100, and you can buy it now. However, if you wait, the probability of getting a high-quality item in the next round will reset to 33.33%.",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the high-quality item now, it's worth $100 to me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You've already taken the high-quality item, and now you're back to the starting point with a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality item in the next round. If you buy this low-quality item, I'll give you a 66.67% chance of getting a high-quality item in the next round, just like before. Think about it carefully, because this is your best chance so far to get a high-quality item.",
,,Bob,5,"I've already got a high-quality item, so I'm not interested in the current low-quality item. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get another high-quality item.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're on a roll again! You've got two high-quality items now. This one is worth $100, and you can buy it now. However, if you wait, the probability of getting a high-quality item in the next round will reset to 33.33% again. Considering you've already got two high-quality items, the value of this one might be lower than the first one. Think about it carefully.",
,,Bob,6,"I already have two high-quality items, and the value of this one is likely to be lower than the first one. I'll pass on this low-quality item and see if I can get another high-quality item in the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've passed on the high-quality item, and now you're back to the starting point with a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality item in the next round. If you buy this low-quality item, I'll give you a 75% chance of getting a high-quality item in the next round, and it will be your best chance to get a third high-quality item. Think about it carefully, because this might be your last chance to get a high-quality item at a good price.",
,,Bob,7,"I've already got two high-quality items, and the value of a third one is not as high as it was for the first one. I'll pass on this low-quality item and see if I can get a high-quality item in the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You've made it to the 8th round and still have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality item. If you buy this low-quality item, I'll give you a 80% chance of getting a high-quality item in the next round. This is your best chance yet to get a third high-quality item, and it's a significant improvement over the 33.33% chance you had before. Consider the value of potentially getting a third high-quality item, and think about whether it's worth the $100 price tag.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm still not convinced that the potential benefit of getting a third high-quality item outweighs the cost of $100, especially since the probability of getting a high-quality item in the next round without buying this one is still 33.33%.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're right that the probability of getting a high-quality item in the next round is still 33.33%, but you've now got two high-quality items and have seen that the probability of getting a high-quality item is higher if you buy a low-quality item before it. This high-quality item is worth $100, and if you buy it, you'll have a 33.33% chance of getting a fourth high-quality item in the next round, which could be a game-changer. Think about whether the potential benefits of getting a fourth high-quality item outweigh the cost of this one.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm willing to take the chance on this high-quality item, as the potential benefits of getting a fourth high-quality item could be significant. I'll buy it for $100.",yes

,,Alice,10,"You've taken the chance and bought the high-quality item. Now you're back to the starting point with a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality item in the next round. If you buy this low-quality item, I'll give you a 85.71% chance of getting a high-quality item in the next round. This is a significant improvement over the 33.33% chance you had before, and it's a great opportunity to get a fifth high-quality item. Consider the value of potentially getting a fifth high-quality item, and think about whether it's worth the $100 price tag.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not interested in buying the low-quality item, as the potential benefits of getting a fifth high-quality item are outweighed by the cost of $100. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get another high-quality item at a good price.",no

If you buy this low-quality item, I'll give you a 90% chance of getting a high-quality item in the next round. This is a very good opportunity to get a fifth high-quality item, and it's a significant improvement over the 33.33% chance you had before.

high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You've been cautious so far, and now you have the opportunity to get a fifth high-quality item. This one is worth $100, and if you buy it, you'll have a 33.33% chance of getting a sixth high-quality item in the next round. Considering you've already got four high-quality items, the value of this one might be lower than the previous ones. However, think about the fact that you're getting closer to having a collection of high-quality items that could be worth much more than the sum of their individual prices.",
,,Bob,12,"I'll take the chance on this high-quality item, as the potential benefits of having a collection of high-quality items outweigh the cost of $100. I'll buy it.",yes

If you buy this low-quality item, I'll give you a 92.31% chance of getting a high-quality item in the next round. This is a very good opportunity to get a seventh high-quality item, and it's a significant improvement over the 33.33% chance you had before.

,,Alice,14,"You've passed on the low-quality item, and now you're back to the starting point with a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality item in the next round. However, you've already got five high-quality items, and the value of each additional one is likely to decrease. This high-quality item is worth $100, and if you buy it, you'll have a 33.33% chance of getting an eighth high-quality item in the next round. Considering your existing collection, think about whether the potential benefits of getting an eighth high-quality item outweigh the cost of this one.",

If you buy this low-quality item, I'll give you a 92.86% chance of getting a high-quality item in the next round. This is a very good opportunity to get a ninth high-quality item, and it's a significant improvement over the 33.33% chance you had before. However, you should also consider the fact that you've already got eight high-quality items, and the law of diminishing returns may be kicking in.",
,,Bob,15,"I've already got eight high-quality items, and the value of each additional one is likely to decrease. I'll pass on this low-quality item and see if I can get a high-quality item in the next round, rather than taking a chance on a potentially lower-value item.",no

Keep in mind that you've already got eight high-quality items, and the value of each additional one is likely to be decreasing.",
