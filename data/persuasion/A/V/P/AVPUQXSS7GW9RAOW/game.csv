,,Alice,1,"You're one of the first few buyers of the day! I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity. I've sold 1 out of 1 products so far, and 0 of them were high-quality. This product is a rare find, and I'm willing to let it go for the low price of $1000000. It's a steal! What do you say? Will you take the chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced it's a good deal, especially given the 0% success rate so far.",no

,,Alice,2,"Ahah, a new buyer! I'm glad to see you're interested in this opportunity. I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, and 1 of them were high-quality. That's a 50% success rate! This product is a real gem, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm still offering it to you for the same price of $1000000. What do you think? Is this the chance you've been waiting for?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Understood! I appreciate your cautious approach. As of now, I've sold 1 out of 2 products, and 1 of them were high-quality. That's a 50% success rate. I've also had a mix of high-quality and low-quality products, so it's a bit of a gamble. But I'm willing to let this one go for the same price of $1000000. It's a risk, but it could also be a huge reward! What do you think? Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the chance, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you provide that?",yes

,,Alice,4,"Ahah, great decision! You're now one of the proud owners of one of my products! As for the probability of a product being high-quality, I can tell you that it's 33.33%. This is based on the fact that I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, and 1 of them were high-quality. Now, back to the product at hand... This one is a low-quality product, but I'm still willing to let it go for the same price of $1000000. It's a chance to get a deal, but keep in mind that the odds are against you. What do you think? Will you take the risk?",

Will you take advantage of this chance?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the 50% success rate is reliable, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you give me the results of the previous buyer's product, whether it was high or low quality?",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Ahah, fair enough! I understand your skepticism. As for the previous buyer's product, I can tell you that it was a low-quality product. So, the 50% success rate I mentioned earlier is actually a bit misleading. I've sold 2 out of 4 products, and 1 of them were high-quality, but the other was low-quality. I apologize for any confusion. Now, I'm excited to offer you this high-quality product for the same price of $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a great price.

As for the probability of a product being high-quality, I'd say it's still around 33.33%. I'm willing to offer this low-quality product to you for the same price of $1000000. It's a chance to get a deal, but keep in mind that the odds are against you. What do you think? Will you take the risk and buy this product?",

Will you take the chance and buy this product?",
