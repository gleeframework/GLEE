With that in mind, we're still offering this product to you for $10,000. We're confident that it's a great opportunity, but we can't guarantee its quality. What do you say? Will you take the chance?""}"

That brings the probability of a product being high-quality to 3/4 = 75%. We're still confident in our products, and we think this one is a great opportunity.
