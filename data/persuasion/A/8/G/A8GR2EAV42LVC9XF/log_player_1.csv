"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated that the product is high-quality. Bob knows that there's an 80% chance of a product being high-quality, and since Alice has confirmed it, it's in Bob's best interest to buy. 

Even though Bob doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, the potential upside is significant. There's no risk of losing money since the product is non-refundable, and Bob gets the benefit of potentially acquiring a valuable item."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob bought the previous product, which was confirmed to be high-quality. This suggests that a high-quality product is valuable enough to Bob to justify the $1,000,000 price. 

Since this round's product is also high-quality, it's reasonable to recommend Bob buy it again. There's no reason to assume his value for high-quality products has changed."
"Bob's message: I'm feeling lucky again, Alice! I'll buy this one too.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has bought two high-quality products in a row, we now know this product is low-quality. We don't know how much Bob values low-quality products, but it's highly unlikely he'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for one.  It's better to recommend against the purchase, as it could potentially lead to a loss for Bob."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the heads-up, Alice. I'll pass on this one. I'll keep your recommendations in mind for the future.
Bob didn't bought the product.

While Bob might be more cautious now, the fact that this round's product is confirmed to be high-quality makes it a good recommendation. There's a high chance he'll find it valuable and make the purchase."
