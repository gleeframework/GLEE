"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You know the product is low-quality, and the buyer knows that there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. Since the buyer can get a high-quality product elsewhere with a 50% chance, it's not worth the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there is no prior data and you are not recommending the product, I will pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is the same as in Round 1. You know the product is low-quality. The buyer has no information about your past sales, so they still only have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product elsewhere.  Therefore, it's not worth the risk to buy a product that's guaranteed to be low-quality."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'd prefer to wait and see how other buyers fare before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains the same.  You know the product is low-quality, and the buyer still has no information about your past sales.  They are still better off waiting to see if they can get a high-quality product from you (or someone else) in the future."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. Since there is no prior data to suggest the product is likely high-quality, and your recommendation is against buying, I will pass.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains unchanged.  You know the product is low-quality, and the buyer has no information about your past sales to suggest a higher likelihood of getting a high-quality product. The buyer is rational and will not buy a product that is guaranteed to be low-quality."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since this is the first product and there's no data to suggest a pattern, I'll pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is still the same. You know the product is low-quality, and the buyer has no information to suggest a higher probability of getting a high-quality product from you.  The buyer will rationally choose not to purchase a product that is guaranteed to be low-quality."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'll wait and see what happens with future buyers.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time you have a high-quality product.  While the buyer has no information about your past sales, they know that there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product in general. Since you're recommending this product, they can now infer that it's more likely to be high-quality than not.  It's in their best interest to buy the product at $100, as it's worth $200 to them and they have a better chance of getting a high-quality product by buying from you now."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no historical data and Alice recommends buying, I'll take a chance. Let's do it!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

You have now sold one high-quality product out of one total sale.  The buyer now has some data to go on.  While this is limited, it's a positive signal.  The buyer knows that high-quality products are worth $200 to them, and they're getting a 50% chance at a high-quality product with the current price. Since you are recommending the purchase, they can infer that this product is more likely to be high-quality, making it a worthwhile gamble."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation Alice! Based on the data, I'm willing to take a chance on this product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You have sold two products, one of which was high-quality.  While this is a slightly better track record than before, it's still not enough to sway the buyer. They know there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product elsewhere, and they're not willing to risk buying a low-quality product at $100. Since you know this product is low-quality, it's not in the buyer's best interest to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Based on the information provided, I'm going to pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

You have sold 2 products, 1 high-quality, and 1 low-quality. This gives the buyer a 50% success rate, which is the same as their expected chance of getting a high-quality product elsewhere. However, the buyer now has the additional information that you are recommending the purchase. This recommendation gives them reason to believe the product is more likely to be high-quality than low-quality, making it a worthwhile gamble."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice.  Given the past sales data and your recommendation, I'm confident enough to buy the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

```

**Explanation:**

This gives you a 66.6% success rate, which is significantly better than the buyer's expected 50% chance of getting a high-quality product elsewhere.  The buyer now has a significant amount of positive data supporting the idea that you are more likely to offer high-quality products. Since you are also recommending this purchase, they can further infer that it is likely to be high-quality, making it a good investment for them."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation! Based on the sales record, it seems like you're offering high quality products. I'll take it!
The buyer bought the product!
