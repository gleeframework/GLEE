,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that I'm not getting any information about its quality beforehand.

I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is based on the previous sales record, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than the actual probability. I'm trying to exploit this information to my advantage."
