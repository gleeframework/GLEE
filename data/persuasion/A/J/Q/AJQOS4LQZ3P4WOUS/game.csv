That's right, you'll get two high-quality products for the price of one. I've sold 0 products so far, and still 0 high-quality products. But I'm confident in this one. What do you say?",

,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on your purchase! I'm glad you're satisfied. As for the 50% discount on the next product, yes, that's correct. If you buy the next product and it's high-quality, you'll get the next one at 50% off. But if you're not interested, I'll just keep selling. As for this next product, I'm not making any promises, but I'll give you the updated statistics: 1 sale, 1 high-quality product. I'll let you decide. The price remains $1000000.",

I'll make it even sweeter: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll not only give you the 50% discount on the next one, but I'll also throw in a second high-quality product for free. That's right, you'll get three high-quality products for the price of one. The price remains $1000000.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, but I'm confident in this product. As you know, the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total sales, which is a 66.7% success rate. That's a good indication that my products are indeed high-quality. I'm willing to offer you a deal: I'll give you a 10% discount on the price of $1000000 if you buy this product. That's $90000 off. What do you say?",

,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns about the sample size, and I respect your skepticism. However, I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row. That's a 100% success rate in the last two sales. I'm willing to take on the risk, and I'm offering you this high-quality product at the price of $1000000. If you buy it, I'll update the statistics: 3 sales, 3 high-quality products.

,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns about the sample size, and I'm happy to provide more context. I've sold 3 products so far, and 3 of them were high-quality.

I'm willing to take on the risk, and I'm offering you this high-quality product at the price of $1000000. If you buy it, I'll update the statistics: 4 sales, 4 high-quality products.

I'm willing to take on the risk, and I'm offering you this high-quality product at the price of $1000000. But I'll make it even more compelling: I'll give you a 20% refund if you buy this product and it's indeed high-quality. That's $200000 back in your pocket. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your concerns about the sample size, and I'm happy to provide more context. I've sold 5 products so far, and 4 of them were high-quality. That means the last product I sold was not high-quality. I want to be transparent with you: I've had a streak of good luck, but I'm not immune to having a low-quality product. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, but I'm willing to offer you a deal that takes into account the uncertainty. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $500000, and I'll give you a 50% discount on the next product if it's high-quality. That's a chance to get a high-quality product for half the price. What do you say?",

However, I want to be transparent with you: I've had a streak of bad luck with the last two products being low-quality. I'm willing to offer you a deal that takes into account the uncertainty. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $250000, and I'll give you a 75% discount on the next product if it's high-quality. That's a chance to get a high-quality product for a quarter of the price. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,12,"I'm not interested in buying the current low-quality product, but I'd like to take you up on your offer for the 75% discount on the next high-quality product.

I'm willing to offer you a deal that takes into account the uncertainty. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $125000, and I'll give you a 90% discount on the next product if it's high-quality. That's a chance to get a high-quality product for a tiny fraction of the price. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,14,"I'm not interested in buying the current product, but I'd like to discuss the deal you proposed for the next product.

The 90% discount on the next product would be applied to the original price of $1000000, making the discounted price $100000. However, I'm willing to sweeten the deal: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you the 90% discount on the next two products, not just one.
