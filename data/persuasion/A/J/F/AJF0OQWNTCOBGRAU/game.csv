low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that I don't have any information about its quality, so I'm essentially making a blind guess. I'd appreciate it if you could provide some context or information that might help me make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm a risk-taker and I want to see the outcome, not because of Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I don't trust your recommendation. I'm hoping that the product is high-quality and you're just trying to discourage me from buying it because you know I'd be the one to reveal the product's true quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the lack of information about the product's quality and the fact that you're not recommending it. I'm hoping that the low recommendation rate might imply a higher chance of it being low quality, but I'm not confident in this decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to test the probability of a high-quality product being offered, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering your previous recommendations have been based on the quality of the products sold to the previous 5 buyers, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the products sold so far may be biased towards low-quality ones. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, it's likely that the products they were offered were of low quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be higher than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm taking a chance because the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests the probability of a high-quality product might be higher than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that Alice doesn't know my valuation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall average. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, but I'll take a chance and buy the product anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended 9 other products and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall average. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know if you can provide more information about the previous buyers who bought the products. How many of them bought after seeing a low-quality product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm going to buy it, even though you don't recommend it. I'm doing this because I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far is suspicious. It's possible that Alice is recommending low-quality products to buyers, which would mean that the proportion of high-quality products is actually higher than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 13 previous buyers have passed on the product, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to wait for a product that Alice recommends, which might indicate a higher chance of being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm taking a chance that the product is high quality, given the low success rate so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would be a good buy for me."
