Alice's message: Ahah, excellent catch by our discerning buyer! You're absolutely right, our previous message was premature. Since no products have been sold yet, we can't claim a 100% success rate.

Alice's message: Fair question! We've sold 1 product so far, and unfortunately, it was a low-quality one. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, we'd expect about half of our products to be high-quality. Based on this data, we can estimate that the probability of this new product being high-quality is around 50%. We're still willing to sell it to you for $1000000. It's a calculated risk, but we believe the potential reward is worth it. Will you take a chance on our latest offering?
