The price remains the same at $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but the personalized consultation doesn't change my decision. I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless to me.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'd like to acknowledge that the price may seem steep, but I assure you that this product has the potential to bring significant returns on investment. I'm willing to make a bold statement: if you're not completely satisfied with the product's performance, I'll offer you a full refund. No questions asked. The price remains the same at $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer of a refund, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth the risk. Given the 66.67% chance of it being low-quality, I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that could be worth $0 to me.",no

With a price tag of $1000000, I believe it's a worthwhile investment. Would you like to take a chance on this exceptional product?",

This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on some of the risk to prove to you that this product is worth your investment. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not willing to take the risk of paying $900000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. I'd need a much lower price to justify the risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,

I'm willing to take on the risk myself and offer you a deal: I'll buy this product from you for $800000, and you can walk away with a guaranteed profit. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm intrigued by your offer. I'll sell the product back to you for $800000, but only because I believe I can get a better deal than that. I'll accept your offer, but I'm only doing it because I think I can turn a profit.",yes

I'll give you a 30% discount on the next product, and I'll throw in a third product that complements the one I'm offering, valued at $300000. This is a unique opportunity to get three products for the price of two. What do you think?",

This way, you'll have a vested interest in the product's success, and we can share the risks and rewards together. What do you think?",
