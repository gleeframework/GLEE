I've been trying to identify the issue, but so far, I haven't been able to pinpoint the problem. I can tell you that I've been working with the same suppliers and following the same processes, but somehow, the quality just hasn't been meeting my expectations. As for the current product, I don't want to sugarcoat it - it's just another product in the same batch as the previous ones.
