,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is 50%, and it's not worth the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the equal probability of high and low quality products. I'm willing to take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not going to buy the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards getting rid of the low-quality products as quickly as possible.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is low, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm also not sure if I should be influenced by the lack of high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me more about your selection process? Are you trying to maximize sales or do you have some other strategy in mind?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 2, which is 0%. This suggests that the products sold so far are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the probability of it being high quality is still 50% and it's worth $120 to me."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers received recommendations to buy and none of them were high-quality, I suspect that Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered."
