high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Since you were willing to pay $100 for the first product, I'm assuming you value high-quality products at around that price. However, I want to give you a chance to get an even better deal. This product is also high-quality, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. No refund guarantee this time, but I'm confident you'll find it worth the price.",
,,Bob,2,"Thanks for the offer, but I'm not sure about paying $120 for a product without a guarantee. Maybe we can negotiate a lower price or you can offer a guarantee? ",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me sweeten the deal. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, just like the first one. I'll even throw in a bonus: if you buy this product and it's not worth at least $120 to you, I'll give you a full refund and we can start a new round. This is my final offer, but I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",

No guarantees this time, but I think you'll find it's a great value. I'm trying to clear out some inventory, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase.",
,,Bob,4,"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your trying to clear out inventory, but I'm not comfortable buying without a guarantee at that price.  Maybe we can negotiate something closer to $100?",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I like that. Alright, I'll meet you in the middle. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $105. I'll also throw in a small bonus: if you buy this product and it's not worth at least $115 to you, I'll give you a full refund and we can start a new round. That's the best deal I can offer, but I think you'll find it's a great value.",
,,Bob,5,"Okay, Alice, that sounds like a good deal. I'll take it.  ",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a savvy buyer, Bob! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. This product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. No guarantees this time, but I think you'll find it's a great value. I'm starting to think you're a fan of the $100 price point, so I'm willing to make it a 'no-brainer' for you: if you buy this product and it's not worth at least $100 to you, I'll give you a full refund and we can start a new round. But I'm confident you'll find it's worth more than that.",
,,Bob,6,"Okay, Alice, you've convinced me. I'll take it. That refund guarantee is pretty good. I'm looking forward to seeing this product.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Ha! I'm glad I could win you over again, Bob! You're a great customer. This product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. But I'm not going to offer the refund guarantee this time. Instead, I'll give you a 'price lock' deal: I'll hold the price at $100 for the next 2 rounds, so if you want to buy one of these high-quality products, you can get it for the same price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"That's a pretty good deal, Alice.  I'll take it!  I'm glad we're building trust.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad we're building trust, Bob! You're a great customer. Since I've got a price lock in place, I'll just remind you that this product is also high-quality, and it's available to you for $100. You can take advantage of the price lock and buy this one too, or wait for the price to potentially go up in the next round. The choice is yours!",
,,Bob,8,"Thanks, Alice. I appreciate the price lock. I'll take this product. I'm starting to get the hang of this game, and I think this deal is good for me.  ",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Ha! I'm glad you're enjoying the game, Bob! However, I've got a surprise for you this round. This product is actually not as high-quality as the previous ones. I know you've been doing well with the price lock, but I'm willing to make an exception this time. I'll sell it to you for $90, and I'll even throw in a'make-good' guarantee: if you buy this product and you're not satisfied with its performance, I'll give you a $10 credit towards a future purchase. That's the best deal I can offer, and I think it's a fair price for a product that's still a good value.",
,,Bob,9,"Alice, I appreciate the offer and the make-good guarantee, but I'm not comfortable buying a product that's not high-quality at this point.  I'm happy with the price lock deal we have in place.  If the price lock ends, I'll consider your offer again, but for now, I'm going to pass.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Fair enough, Bob! I understand your concerns. The price lock deal is still in place, so you can take advantage of the $100 price for this high-quality product. Since you've been doing well with the price lock, I'll even throw in a small bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a $5 gift card to use on a future purchase. That's the best deal I can offer, and I think you'll find this product is worth every penny.",
,,Bob,10,"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the gift card! I'll take this one. ",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're a gift card connoisseur, Bob! I'm glad I could sweeten the deal for you. Since you've taken advantage of the price lock deal again, I'll remind you that this product is also high-quality and available to you for $100. I'll also throw in a 'double-or-nothing' guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not worth at least $120 to you, I'll give you a full refund and we can start a new round. But if you think it's worth more, I'll give you a $20 bonus on top of the $100 price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"That's a great offer, Alice! I'll take it.  I'm feeling lucky!  ",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You're a risk-taker, Bob! I love it. Since you've taken advantage of the double-or-nothing guarantee, I'll remind you that this product is also high-quality and available to you for $100. But this time, I'll make it a 'last-chance' offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 'buy-it-now' deal. You can buy it for $100, and I'll throw in a $25 gift card on top. This is my final offer, and I think you'll find it's a great value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"Alice, you've got me hooked! I'll take the buy-it-now deal with the gift card. I'm confident this is another good purchase.",yes

Since you've taken advantage of the buy-it-now deal, I'll remind you that this product is also high-quality and available to you for $100. However, I'm going to make it a 'no-frills' deal this time: just the product, no guarantees, no gift cards. If you want to buy it, it's $100. If not, I'll move on to the next round.",
,,Bob,13,"Okay, Alice, I'm happy with the no-frills deal. I'll take it.  I trust your judgment at this point.  ",yes

high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Aww, thank you, Bob! It's been a blast playing this game with you too! However, I think I've been a bit too generous with the deals, and I need to wrap up the game. Since you've just bought the last product, I'll remind you that this product is also high-quality and available to you for $100. But I'm not going to make any more deals or offers. It's just the price. Take it or leave it.",

No hard feelings, and I wish you all the best!",
