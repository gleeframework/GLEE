"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware that you don't have any prior sales data, so I'm making an uninformed decision based on the expected value. Since there's a 33.33% chance of it being high-quality and a 66.67% chance of it being low-quality, my expected value is (0.3333 * 30000) + (0.6667 * 0) = 10000.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected.

Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product, and that all of them received a recommendation to buy, it suggests that the products they were offered were likely low-quality. This increases my suspicion that the current product is also low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me.
