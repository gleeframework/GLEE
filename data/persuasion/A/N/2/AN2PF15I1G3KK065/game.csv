,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 buyers have purchased the product and only 1 high-quality product has been sold, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to take a chance and pass on this one."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
