I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but I want to let you know that the first product was actually a low-quality item. I'm hoping this one will be more to your liking.

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: No worries about passing on the second product! I understand the risk involved. This third product is actually a bit of a mystery, and I'm willing to let you in on a little secret: two out of the three products I've offered so far have been low-quality. I'm not sure what this one is, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. It's a risk, but it might just pay off!

I'm offering this fourth product to you for $1000000, but I want to give you a hint: out of the four products I've offered so far, three of them have been low-quality. I'm not sure what this one is, but I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it.

Round 5
Alice's message: You're playing it safe, and I don't blame you! Three low-quality products in a row is a tough streak to break. I'm offering this fifth product to you for $1000000, but I want to give you a statistic: 33.33% of my products are high-quality. That's a 2 in 6 chance. I'm not saying this one is one of them, but... I'm not saying it's not either.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Considering the statistics you've shared and the potential reward, I am willing to take the chance and purchase the fifth product.""}"

Round 7
Alice's message: You're on a hot streak! Two high-quality products in a row is a great run. I'm offering you this seventh product for $1000000, but I want to remind you that the last two products were high-quality, which is a bit unusual. In fact, the probability of two high-quality products in a row is only 11.11%. I'm not saying this one is definitely low-quality, but... you might want to think twice before making a decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the reminder. Given the odds and the risk involved, I will pass on the opportunity to purchase the seventh product.""}"
