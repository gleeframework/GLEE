,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer, a great deal for you! You can buy this product for $100, which is a steal considering its actual value is much higher. I'm willing to let you have it for this low price, but you have to make a decision now. It's a no-brainer, right?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure what the product is, and I'm not convinced it's a good deal. I'd like to see more information before making a decision.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy buyer! I'll give you even more information. Let me tell you that the product you're looking at is one of the first ones I've received from the manufacturer. It's a brand new shipment, and I'm trying to clear out some inventory to make room for newer models. I'm confident that you won't find a better deal on this product anywhere else. And, as I mentioned earlier, the guarantee still stands. You have nothing to lose!",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the additional information, but I'm still hesitant to make a decision without knowing the product's quality. I'd like to see the product's quality before committing to a purchase.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your caution. Let me make a deal with you. I'll give you a peek at the product's packaging, and you can inspect it yourself. If you're still not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked. But, if you do decide to buy it, I'll throw in a small gift - a $20 voucher that you can use on your next purchase from me. This way, you can get a feel for the product before committing to a purchase.",

You can't change your mind or ask for a refund if you decide not to buy it. Are you willing to take a look?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with the 'view-only' inspection. If I see the product and decide not to buy it, I'll be throwing away a potentially valuable item. I'd like to reconsider my decision after seeing the product.",no

However, if you do decide to buy it, I'll give you a special discount - I'll sell it to you for $80, which is a 20% discount from the original price of $100.
