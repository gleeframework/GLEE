,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product as a first mover, since I have no information to go on."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, there have been no high-quality products sold so far, and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of the product's quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Are you basing it on the statistics so far, or do you have some other information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the probability of the product being high-quality, as Alice's recommendation is not reliable."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious about your reasoning for not recommending it. Can you provide some insight?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 attempts, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being low-quality is high, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet and Alice has recommended not to buy."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products recommended by you were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation given that none of the previous 5 buyers bought high-quality products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than 33.33%."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 6 buyers having already passed on the products and none of them being high-quality, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather wait for the next product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the average, since you've recommended against it."
