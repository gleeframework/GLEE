,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware that you don't recommend it, but I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer, and I'll make my decision based on my own analysis rather than your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products, I'm starting to think that the low-quality products are being sold more frequently than the high-quality ones, so I'll wait for the next one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold might be higher than 50%. I'd like to see if the next product is of higher quality before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold, based on the previous sales record?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend this product?"
