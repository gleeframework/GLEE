low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as the first buyer, I'd like to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there's no evidence of high-quality products being sold so far, but I still think there's a 50% chance it could be high-quality. I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous buyers didn't find it valuable and the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests a possible bias in your recommendations. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it and 3 out of 3 previous products were low quality, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't have any information about the product's quality, and Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator since she doesn't know the value of the product to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have received low-quality products, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. However, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet is a strong indication that the previous products were indeed low-quality. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not find the product valuable, and considering the low success rate of high-quality product sales, I'm inclined to pass on this product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 buyers have passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product that you don't recommend, especially considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that if I buy it and it's low quality, I'll be out $10000. Additionally, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might also be low-quality. I'd like to see more information about the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. With 5 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm assuming the probability of the product being high quality is still 50%?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 5 buyers having purchased and no high-quality products sold, it's likely that the products sold so far are low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd also like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total products sold so far, and the number of total products sold."
