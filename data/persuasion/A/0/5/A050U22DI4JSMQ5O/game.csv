,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that the first buyer didn't buy and Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but on her strategy to maximize her profit."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous sales record, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3, which is significantly lower than the expected 50%. This suggests that the products offered so far may be more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
