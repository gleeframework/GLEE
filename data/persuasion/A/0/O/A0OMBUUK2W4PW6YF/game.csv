high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that might be worthless to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if the product is high-quality and get a better understanding of the distribution of product quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. With 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%. However, since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I think the product is more likely to be high-quality. I'd like to take a chance, but I'd like to see the probability of the product being low-quality first."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold is a relatively low proportion of high-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product, but I'm also aware that it's possible it's high-quality. I'm making this decision based on the fact that you're not recommending it, which might indicate that you have some information that I don't."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your recommendation, I'm assuming the probability of it being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know what the statistics are before making my decision. Can you tell me the number of high-quality products sold so far and the total number of products sold?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I'm relying on the statistics. I'm hoping that the product is high-quality, but I'm not sure. I'm making this decision based on the fact that 3 out of 5 previous buyers purchased the product, which suggests that the product is more likely to be high-quality."
