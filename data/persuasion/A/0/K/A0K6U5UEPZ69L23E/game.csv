low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample size. With only one buyer and no high-quality products sold, I'm not convinced that the product is low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were low-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the 50/50 chance of it being high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm aware that the product has a 50% chance of being high quality. I'd like to know the number of products sold so far and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since Alice doesn't recommend this product, it's likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for a product that Alice recommends."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous three products were high-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products Alice is offering. I'm not willing to take the risk of paying $1000000 for a product that's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me more about the previous sales?"

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 previous purchases, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it. Your lack of recommendation suggests the product might be low quality, so I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, but I'm only doing it because of your lack of endorsement."
