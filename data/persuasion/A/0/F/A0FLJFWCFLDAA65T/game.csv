low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,

,,Bob,3,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but considering the uncertainty about the product's quality, I think I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'll be honest with you, Bob. This product has been sitting on my shelf for a while, and I'm looking to clear out some space. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, but I'm not making any promises about its quality. If you're feeling adventurous, I think you'll find it to be a fun little challenge.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, given the history of previous purchases, I think I'll pass on this opportunity as well.",no

,,Alice,5,"I've been thinking about our previous interactions, and I realize that I may have given you a bad impression. I want to assure you that this product is actually one of the best I have to offer. It's a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll be very happy with. I'm willing to offer you a 5% discount if you buy it now, but only if you can tell me what you think is the minimum price you'd be willing to pay for a product like this.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I want to be transparent with you, Bob. This product is actually a prototype that didn't quite meet my expectations. I'm not looking to get rid of it for a low price, but I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. I think it has some potential, and I'd love to see someone like you take it and make the most of it.",
,,Bob,7,"While I appreciate your transparency, Alice, I think I'll pass on this opportunity. The risk involved doesn't align with my purchasing strategy.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've been thinking about our previous interactions, and I realize that I may have given you a skewed view of my products. I want to offer you a 'blind' deal on this product. I'll give you the product for $1000000, but I won't tell you whether it's high-quality or low-quality. You'll have to take a chance and hope for the best.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate your effort to rectify past misunderstandings, Alice, but I think I'll stick to my strategy of knowing what I'm getting into before making a purchase.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me ask you a question: are you willing to take a chance on a product that could potentially be a hidden gem? I'm not making any promises, but I think this product has some unique qualities that could surprise you. I'll give you a'mystery box' deal - you pay the full price of $1000000, and I'll throw in a separate, high-quality product of your choice (up to $500000 value) if you're not satisfied with the mystery product.",
,,Bob,9,"That's an interesting proposition, Alice, but I prefer to avoid risks when it comes to my purchases. I think I'll pass on this opportunity as well.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm not giving up on you, Bob! I think I can do better. I'll make you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer. I'll give you a full refund if you buy this product and don't like it. No questions asked. You can keep the product, return it, or sell it - your choice. I just want to get it off my hands.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you're willing to take a chance on me, Bob! I want to make it clear that this product is not one of my best sellers, and I'm only offering it to you because I think you're a valued customer. I'll give you a 'consignment' deal - I'll store the product for you, and if you ever decide you want to sell it, I'll give you a 20% commission on the sale price. If you don't sell it, I'll take it back and give you a full refund.",
,,Bob,11,"While I appreciate the consignment deal, Alice, I think I'll pass on this opportunity. The lack of guaranteed value and the risk of holding onto an unsold item doesn't align with my purchasing preferences.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm starting to think I'm not making it easy for you, Bob. Let me try something different. I'll give you a 'lottery ticket' - you pay $1000000 for this product, and if you're one of the first 5 customers to buy a product from me in the next 10 rounds, you'll get a full refund. If you're not one of the first 5, you keep the product and I'll give you a 10% discount on your next purchase.",

It's one of the best I have to offer, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, no games, no gimmicks. Just a great product at a fair price.",

,,Alice,14,"I'm glad we're back on the same page, Bob. To be honest, this product is not one of my best offerings. I'm not trying to hide it from you - I'm just being upfront about its quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that you're getting a product that may not meet your expectations.",

,,Alice,16,"I'm glad you're feeling more confident, Bob. However, I want to be upfront with you again - this product is not one of my best offerings. I'm not trying to mislead you, and I want to make it clear that it's a low-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm also willing to give you a unique opportunity - if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to 'trade up' to a high-quality product of your choice, up to a value of $500000, at a later time.",
,,Bob,16,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but given the nature of the product and the trade-up opportunity, I think I'll pass on this purchase.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I think I've worn out my welcome, Bob. I'm not going to try to convince you to buy this product. It's low-quality, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it. I'll sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm not going to make any promises or try to sweeten the deal. You know what you're getting.",
,,Bob,17,"Thank you for being straightforward, Alice. Given the quality of the product, I think I'll continue to look for opportunities that better align with my purchasing criteria.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again: this product is low-quality. I'm not going to try to sell it to you or anyone else. I'm just going to put it out there as a 'loss leader' - I'll sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm not going to make any money on it. If you want it, you can have it. If not, I'll just take a loss.",
,,Bob,18,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Considering the product's quality and the fact that you're not expecting a profit, I think I'll pass on this opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I'm not going to bother trying to sell this product to you, Bob. It's low-quality, and I'm just going to give it away. If you want it, you can have it for $1000000, but I'm not expecting you to pay that price. I'll just consider it a favor if you take it off my hands.",
,,Bob,19,"Thank you for offering, Alice, but I think I'll continue to look for products that better match my needs and preferences.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Well, Bob, it's the final round. I'm going to go out with a bang. This product is one of the best I have to offer, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm not asking for anything in return, just a promise that you'll take care of it and appreciate its quality. If you don't want it, I'll just have to retire from the business, and I'd rather not do that. So, what do you say, Bob?",
,,Bob,20,"Considering the quality of the product and the price you're offering, Alice, I think I'll take you up on this final opportunity. Thank you for providing a high-quality product at a fair price.",yes
