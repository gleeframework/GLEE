Not bad, if I do say so myself! But I understand that you're a savvy buyer, and you want to know more.

Now, let's talk about this new product. I know it's not as high-quality as the previous one, but I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $100. Why? Because I want to make sure you're happy with your purchase, and I'm willing to take a hit on this one to keep your trust. Plus, think of it as a chance to get a deal on a product that's still got some value. What do you say?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not convinced that this product is worth $100, even if it's a 'deal'. With only 2 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80%.

However, I'm a bit concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality has decreased to 66.67% based on the previous sales record. I'd like to propose a compromise: I'll buy the product, but I'd like to negotiate the price. Given the lower probability of it being high-quality, I'm willing to offer $80 for it. If it's high-quality, I'll pay the full $100, but if it's low-quality, I'll only pay $80. What do you think?
