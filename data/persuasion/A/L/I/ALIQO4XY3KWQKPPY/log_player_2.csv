**Explanation:**

* **Strong evidence:** The statistics show a 100% success rate for recommended products. 
* **Alice's expertise:** Alice is recommending the product, implying she believes it is high quality. 
* **Potential reward:**  A high-quality product is worth a significant amount ($300). The risk of a low-quality product is offset by the potential gain.

**Important Note:** This decision relies on the assumption that Alice's recommendations are trustworthy and not biased towards selling more products."

**Explanation:**

Since 8 out of 8 products sold have been high quality, it's highly likely that Alice's recommendations are accurate. Therefore, it's in your best interest to accept the recommendation and purchase the product. Even if there's a small chance it's low quality, the potential gain of a high-quality product at a discounted price outweighs the risk."
