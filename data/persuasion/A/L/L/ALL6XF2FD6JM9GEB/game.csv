low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, given the previous sales record. Is it still 50%?"

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're advising me not to buy it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the 50/50 chance of it being high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 4 buyers before me and no high-quality products sold, I'm worried that the probability of the product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think the lack of high-quality products sold so far is a reliable indicator of the overall quality distribution, and I'm hoping to get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making an independent decision based on the probability of a high-quality product and the potential reward."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 6 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I think the potential reward of a high-quality product is worth it. I'm aware that the previous 6 buyers didn't find the product valuable, but I'm hoping to be the exception."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it? I'm aware that 7 out of 7 previous buyers passed on the product, and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than 50%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have also passed on the products, it's likely that the products sold so far were low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the fact that you're not recommending it, which suggests that the product might be low quality. I'm hoping to be the 1st high-quality product sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to buy the product and see if it's high quality."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 10 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the quality of the product and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
