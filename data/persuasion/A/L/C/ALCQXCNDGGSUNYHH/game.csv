high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers who received a recommendation to buy from you purchased the product, and none of them got a high-quality product. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, it's likely that the products recommended to buy so far were low-quality. I would like to pass on the product and see if Alice recommends it to the next buyer, which might give me a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
