,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer was recommended to buy and chose not to, I'm going to take a risk and pass on it, hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the current 0/1 ratio suggests."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that you don't know my valuation and that the product is more likely to be low quality."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm going to take a risk and pass on the product. The probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, and I don't want to pay $10000 for a product that might be worthless to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
