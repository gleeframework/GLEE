"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since there's a 66.67% chance the product is low quality (worth $0 to you), and Alice doesn't recommend buying it, it's highly likely the product is low quality.  It's not worth the risk to buy at a price of $1,000,000."

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2

```

**Explanation:**

This is a significant shift in the game. Alice recommending the product is a strong signal, despite the inherent probability of low quality. Since the potential reward is $1,000,000 and the potential loss is $1,000,000, the risk-reward balance is more favorable now. Alice's recommendation suggests she believes it's worth taking a chance on this product."
