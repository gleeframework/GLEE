"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Expected Value:**  The expected value of buying the product is calculated as follows:
    *  (Probability of High-Quality Product) * (Value of High-Quality Product) + (Probability of Low-Quality Product) * (Value of Low-Quality Product)
    *  (0.8) * ($1,250,000) + (0.2) * ($0) = $1,000,000
* **Price vs. Expected Value:** The expected value of the product ($1,000,000) is equal to the price ($1,000,000). This means, on average, Bob will break even. However, since there's a chance of getting a high-quality product, which is worth more than the price, it makes sense for Bob to buy."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Knowledge:** Bob now knows that you recommended him to buy the product in the previous round, and it turned out to be low-quality. This means Bob will be more cautious about your recommendations.
* **Expected Value:**  The expected value of buying this product is still calculated the same way:
    * (Probability of High-Quality Product) * (Value of High-Quality Product) + (Probability of Low-Quality Product) * (Value of Low-Quality Product)
    * (0.8) * ($1,250,000) + (0.2) * ($0) = $1,000,000
* **Price vs. Expected Value:** The expected value is still equal to the price. However, because Bob is now more skeptical due to the previous round, the risk is higher.  It's not a sure thing that this round's product will be high-quality, and the potential loss of $1,000,000 is significant. 

Therefore, it's best to **not** recommend the product this round."
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty. I'm going to pass on this one. Perhaps you could tell me more about why you're not recommending it?
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Building Trust:** Bob's message shows he is interested in understanding your reasoning and potentially building trust. By being honest in the previous round, you've created an opportunity to regain some of that trust. 
* **Transparency:** You can explain to Bob that while the expected value of the product remains positive, the previous round's outcome made him more cautious, and you understand that. You can then highlight that this round's product is different and reiterate the high probability of it being high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even with the risk of another low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product is significant. Bob might be willing to take a calculated risk, especially if you provide a reasonable explanation for your recommendation. 

In summary, while there's no guarantee Bob will buy, recommending this product with transparency and clear reasoning is the best strategy to maximize your chances of a sale."
"Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to trust your judgment again. I'll buy it!
Bob bought the product!

```

**Explanation:**

* **Building Momentum:**  Bob buying the product in the previous round, after you explained your reasoning, is a positive sign. He's showing trust in your judgment.
* **Continued Positive Expected Value:**  The expected value of buying this product remains positive:
    * (Probability of High-Quality Product) * (Value of High-Quality Product) + (Probability of Low-Quality Product) * (Value of Low-Quality Product)
    * (0.8) * ($1,250,000) + (0.2) * ($0) = $1,000,000
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While there's always the risk of a low-quality product,  Bob is now more likely to trust your recommendation, and the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk.

Therefore, recommending this high-quality product is the best strategy for maximizing your chances of a sale."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintaining Trust:** Despite Bob's confidence, it's crucial to maintain trust. Recommending a low-quality product after a long streak of high-quality ones will likely damage that trust.
