,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since there's no prior data to go by. I'll just have to rely on the expected value of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product that you're just being cautious about."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd rather wait for another product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it? Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you share the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm hoping to be the first to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm assuming the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'll take a chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. This suggests that you think it's likely to be low quality, which matches my prior probability of 66.67%. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $100, which is a good deal for me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you provide that?

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that 6 buyers have already been offered the product and none of them found it valuable, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. Alice's recommendation not to buy also supports this assumption."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you tell me more about why you don't recommend it?"
