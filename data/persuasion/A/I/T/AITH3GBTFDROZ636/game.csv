high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me offer you a compromise. I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $9000, which is a 10% discount from the original price. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. If you're still hesitant, I can also offer to let you inspect the product before purchasing, but I must warn you that this will void the warranty.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in buying a product that I don't know the quality of, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for the next round and see if I can get a better deal or more information about the product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to be transparent with you. I'm offering you a product that I'm not even willing to keep in my inventory. It's a low-quality item that I'm willing to sell to you for the same price as the high-quality ones, $10000. I know it sounds crazy, but I'm willing to take a loss on this one just to get it off my hands. I'm not trying to scam you, I'm just trying to clear out some inventory. If you're feeling adventurous, you can take a chance on it for the same price as the high-quality ones.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not going to pay $10000 for a low-quality product, regardless of how desperate you are to get rid of it. I'll pass on this opportunity and wait for the next round.",no

,,Alice,4,"I've been transparent about the quality of the previous product, and I'm willing to do the same for this one. I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. However, I want to make it worth your while. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product you purchase from me, regardless of its quality. This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid if you buy this product. It's a $2000 value, absolutely free.",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Great choice on the previous product, Bob! I'm glad you're happy with it. Now, let's talk about this next product. I'm offering you another high-quality product, and I'm willing to give you an even better deal than before. I'll sell it to you for $9000, which is a 10% discount from the original price. But that's not all - I'll also throw in a free maintenance package worth $1000, which will ensure that your new product stays in top condition for years to come. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in paying $9000 for a high-quality product, even with the free maintenance package. I've already bought one high-quality product from you and made a profit, and I'm not willing to pay full price for another one. I'll pass on this opportunity and wait for the next round.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your position, Bob. You've already taken advantage of the 20% discount on the next product offer, and you're looking for an even better deal. Let me think for a moment... Alright, I've got it. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $8000, which is a 20% discount from the original price. But that's not all - I'll also give you the option to return it for a full refund within 30 days, no questions asked. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not willing to pay $8000 for a high-quality product, even with the option to return it. I'm still waiting for a better deal or a chance to buy a low-quality product for a low price.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm starting to think you're a tough negotiator, Bob! Alright, let's try something different. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $7000, which is a 30% discount from the original price. But here's the twist: I'll also give you the option to buy a second high-quality product from me at the same price, but only if you buy this one. If you buy this product and then decide you want the second one, I'll give you a 50% discount on the second one. This is a one-time offer, and it's a great opportunity to stock up on high-quality products.",

And, as a reminder, you still have the option to buy a second high-quality product at 50% off if you decide you need it.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in paying $6500 for a high-quality product, even with the premium warranty. I've already bought two high-quality products from you and made a profit, and I'm not willing to pay full price for a third one. I'll pass on this opportunity and wait for the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I know you're a savvy buyer, Bob, and you're looking for a good deal. I've got a product that I'm willing to let go of for a very low price. It's a... let's call it a 'project' item. It's not in the best condition, but it has some potential. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. And, as a bonus, I'll throw in a set of tools to help you fix it up and make it shine. It's a great opportunity to make some money on the flip, and I'm willing to take a loss on it just to get it off my hands.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm willing to take a chance on the 'project' item for $1000. I'm not expecting it to be in great condition, but I'll take a look and see if I can fix it up and make a profit. I'll take it!",yes
