,,the buyer,10,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing so because I'm trying to gather information about the product's quality, not because I think it's worth $1000000 to me.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad to report that I've had 5 sales so far. Out of the 10 previous products, 1 was high-quality, and 9 were low-quality.

Take advantage of this opportunity for $1000000.",

Would you like to take a chance on it for $1000000?",

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've had 7 sales so far, all of which were low-quality products. Out of the 17 previous products, 5 were high-quality, and 12 were low-quality.
