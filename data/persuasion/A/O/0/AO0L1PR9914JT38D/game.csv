high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that the first two buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that all previous buyers have also passed on the product after your recommendation. I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality."

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that I'm the third buyer, and I don't want to fall into a trap. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,

I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000. With 2 failed attempts so far, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality, and I don't want to be the one to complete the set."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I think it's possible that the product is low-quality given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. Based on the statistics, I notice that 2 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality.
