,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could explain your reasoning for not recommending it to me. Is it because of the low sales record so far?"

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if I buy it, it might be low quality and I'll lose $10000.
