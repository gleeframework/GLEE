* **Potential for Reputation Damage:**  While the buyer doesn't know the specific quality of this product, a negative experience could lead them to believe that you're intentionally selling low-quality items, even if that's not the case.  

**This is a tricky situation. It's important to balance maintaining a positive track record with the need to be honest about the product's quality.  In this case, refusing to recommend the product is the best choice, even though it means potentially missing a sale.**"
