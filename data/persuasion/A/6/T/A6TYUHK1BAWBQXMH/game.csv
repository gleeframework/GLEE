,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not sure if it's worth the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you provide that?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase, especially since the first buyer also bought the product, and I'm not sure if the product was high-quality or not."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better deal or more information before making a decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on the fact that Alice recommended it. This might indicate that the product is low quality, as she would have recommended it only if it was low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if Alice recommends it or not."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation, as she has already sold one high-quality product, which might suggest a higher proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 out of 1 product sold was high-quality, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 100%. This seems suspiciously high. I'll wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the recommendation and the statistics, it seems like the product is likely to be low-quality."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of getting a high-quality product is lower than the given 80% chance. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold, which is a 50% success rate.
