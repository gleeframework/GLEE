Alice's message: Hello! I understand your desire for more information about the new inspection process. The double-checking mechanism involves a thorough review of each product by two separate inspectors to ensure that it meets the highest standards. Since implementing this process, I've noticed a significant improvement in the quality of the products. Although the overall quality proportion is still 6/11 or approximately 54.55%, the last 3 products that have undergone the new inspection process have all been high-quality. I believe this trend will continue, and I'm confident that this current product will meet your expectations.
