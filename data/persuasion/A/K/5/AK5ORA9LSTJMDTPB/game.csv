low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm not sure what the quality is, and I'm willing to take the risk to get the first product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far is a good indication that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is low, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to gather more data to make a more informed decision in the future."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, as well as the total number of products sold and buyers who have seen the product so far."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 products were high-quality, I think it's likely that this product is also low-quality, and I don't want to spend $100 on something that's not worth it to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm suspicious that all the sold products were low-quality. If I buy this product, I'll be the 5th buyer to pass on it, which would make the proportion of high-quality products sold 0 out of 5, reinforcing my suspicion. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the fact that you don't recommend it. Your lack of recommendation suggests the product is likely low-quality, which would be a good value for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you don't recommend it and there have been 5 previous sales with no high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have passed on the products and none of them were high quality, I think it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it, which makes me think it's likely to be low quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 6 products, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope for the best!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that the previous buyers' experiences are representative, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the previous 8 buyers, and the probability of a low-quality product being sold to the previous 8 buyers, based on the given data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 8 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought. I'd like to get a better sense of the product's quality before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not going to take the risk. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have been discouraged by Alice's recommendations, and no high-quality products have been sold. This suggests that Alice may be able to infer that I value high-quality products highly, and therefore, the product I'm being offered is likely to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it to see if it's a high-quality product."
