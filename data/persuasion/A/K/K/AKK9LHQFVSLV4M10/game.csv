,,Alice,3,yes,

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product with a 66.67% chance of being low quality, especially given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers and their experiences? Did they have access to the same information I do? Did they ask you any questions before making their decisions? I'd like to understand the context behind your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality has decreased. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity or get more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice is not recommending it, which suggests that the probability of it being high-quality is low."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I'm going to assume the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 previous sales, I suspect that the product is likely to be low quality. I will pass on this product."

,,Alice,11,no,

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the current statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have rejected the product, which suggests that the product is likely low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm inclined to trust the trend and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on Alice's lack of recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on it."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that none of the previous buyers were able to get a high-quality product, and the recommendation to buy is not based on the product's actual quality, but rather Alice's strategy to sell low-quality products. I'd like to know the probability of getting a high-quality product if I buy this one."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the one to get the high-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
