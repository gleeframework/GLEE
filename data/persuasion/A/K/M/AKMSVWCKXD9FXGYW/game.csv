,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100, which is the listed price. If it's high-quality, I'll be happy to pay the true value of $300. If it's low-quality, I'll only pay $100."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the previous two buyers who bought products were recommended to buy by you, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that your recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards the product being low quality, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making a decision based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, I infer that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product to come along."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she's seen 3 previous buyers pass on the products, which likely means they were low-quality. If the previous buyers were all low-quality, the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products would be higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
