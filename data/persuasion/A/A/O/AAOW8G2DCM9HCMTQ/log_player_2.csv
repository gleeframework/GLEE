**Reasoning:**

* **High Purchase Rate:**  The fact that 3 out of 3 buyers purchased the product and all 3 were high-quality suggests a very strong pattern. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal, particularly given the high success rate. 

While there's still a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the data points overwhelmingly to a high-quality product. The potential reward ($300) outweighs the risk of a $0 product."
