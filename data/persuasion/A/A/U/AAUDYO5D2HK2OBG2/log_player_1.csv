"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first product sold was high-quality, it's possible that the next product might be low-quality, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000 on a low-quality product.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I want to see more data before making a decision, especially since only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far. I'd like to know the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

The buyer should not be dissuaded by the lack of further data since the initial information is already sufficient for a sound decision."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product. Was it a high-quality or low-quality product?

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer is requesting information about previous sales, but this information is not relevant to the quality of the current product.  Even though the overall probability of a high-quality product is 80%, the buyer should not purchase a product that is worth nothing to them.
