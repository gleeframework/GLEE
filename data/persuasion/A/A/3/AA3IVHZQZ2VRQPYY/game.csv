high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one, but I'm doing it because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any prior information to go on. If I were in your shoes, Alice, I'd be more cautious!"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it based on the recommendation, not because I have any information about its quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 2 out of 2 products sold were high-quality, which suggests a high probability of the product being high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far?
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she doesn't know my valuation, and I'm trying to exploit this uncertainty to my advantage. With only 2 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the current product being high quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait and see the recommendation for the next product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that she doesn't know how much I value the product, and she might be trying to sell a low-quality product to me. With a 20% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'd like to know the quality of the products that were sold before me, and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, to make a more informed decision."

,,Alice,12,yes,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'm curious about the previous sales record. Can you tell me more about the 4 buyers who purchased the products? What was the quality of the products they bought?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. However, I'm a bit concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, since 20% of the products are low quality. I'd like to know if there's any way to verify the quality of the product before making a final decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm taking into account the 80% chance of it being high-quality and the fact that I have access to the previous sales record, which suggests a decent proportion of high-quality products have been sold so far."
