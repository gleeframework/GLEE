While it still has some redeeming qualities, it's not a top-of-the-line item. I'm offering it to you at the same price of $10000, but I want to be upfront about its limitations. If you're willing to take a chance on a product that might not meet your expectations, I'm willing to let you purchase it at the same price. Keep in mind that this product might not provide the same level of value as the previous one.""
}"
"Bob's message: While I appreciate your transparency and the opportunity to purchase the product at the same price, given the uncertainty about its quality, I believe it's best to pass on this opportunity.

}"

I'm willing to make a concession: I'll give you the $3000 credit we discussed earlier, plus an additional $1500 credit, making it a total of $4500, if you purchase this product.
