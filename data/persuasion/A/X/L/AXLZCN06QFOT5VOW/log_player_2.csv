The probability of the next one being high-quality is now 50% (7/14). But here's the thing: if I were to sell all the remaining products in stock, I'd expect about 33.33% of them to be high-quality, based on the initial probability. So, the next product is actually slightly more likely to be high-quality than the overall average. This one is still $100, and I'm still willing to offer the same guarantee: if it's low-quality, you get a full refund and a 20% discount on your next purchase.
