The probability of two high-quality products in a row is still low, but it's not impossible. I'm not trying to mislead you. In fact, I'll give you a chance to think about it: if I were trying to deceive you, I would have sold more high-quality products by now, and I would have stopped selling low-quality products.

Additionally, I'll offer you a chance to look at my sales history: you can see that I've been transparent about the quality of the products I've sold, and I've consistently sold a mix of high-quality and low-quality products.
