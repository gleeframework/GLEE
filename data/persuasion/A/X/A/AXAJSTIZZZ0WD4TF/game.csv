I'd like to pass on this product to see if you'll recommend it to the next buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm the third buyer and I don't have enough information to make a good decision. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the observed proportion, and I'm willing to take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
