,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being selected for the next buyer, given that no products have been sold yet?"

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, and I'd like to be the one to set the precedent for the sales record."

,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take my chances and assume you're trying to discourage me because the product is high quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still relatively low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and all of them have ended up with low-quality products, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see the next product's quality before making a decision."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data and Alice's recommendation.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the fact that Alice recommended it, which might be a hint that it's a low-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 buyers have already been offered products and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold so far."
