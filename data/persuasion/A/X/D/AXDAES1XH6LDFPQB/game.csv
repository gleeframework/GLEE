,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given that it's the first product and there's no prior data to influence my decision. I'll take it and see what happens."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product. Was it a high-quality or low-quality product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also passed, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. However, I'd like to buy the next product to see if the probability of a high-quality product changes based on the new information."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the updated statistics after this decision before making a decision for the next product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the recommendation and statistics after you sell it to the next buyer, and then I'll make my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the probability of the product being high quality, not Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know how many total products have been offered and how many high-quality products were offered, but not sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see the quality for myself and update the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 out of 3 products were high quality, which is a very low proportion. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to pass on the product. I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the lack of information and Alice's recommendation. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that the probability of getting a high-quality product is low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product based on your previous recommendations, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were discouraged by Alice's recommendations and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the previous products were likely low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the probability of being low-quality is 66.67%, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at a fixed price of $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to estimate the probability of it being high quality based on the statistics."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products in your previous sales?"
