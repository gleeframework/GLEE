Alice should not recommend the product to Bob.  Since there is no way for Alice to signal the quality of the product, it's always in Bob's best interest to assume the product is low-quality and decline the purchase. This ensures that Bob avoids the loss of $100 for a low-quality product, and he doesn't gain anything by buying."
