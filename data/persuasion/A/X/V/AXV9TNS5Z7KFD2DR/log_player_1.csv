"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying a product is the probability of it being high-quality multiplied by its value if high-quality, minus the probability of it being low-quality multiplied by its value if low-quality. 
    * Expected Value = (0.8 * $1,250,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $1,000,000 
* **Price:** The price of the product is $1,000,000.
* **Profit:** Since the expected value of the product is equal to the price, Bob is expected to break even. This means there is no financial risk in buying the product.

**Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product.**"

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has no way of knowing whether this round's product is high or low quality.  Since the expected value of a product is $1,000,000, and the price is $1,000,000, Bob should expect to break even. 

It's important to remember:

* **Bob doesn't know the quality of the product in advance.**
* **The expected value of a product is based on the probability of it being high-quality.** 

Therefore, even though we know this round's product is high-quality, Bob doesn't. Based on the information available to Bob, recommending purchase is the best strategy to maximize potential profit."
