  ""message"": ""I'm glad you liked the previous product! However, I must correct my previous message - the discount was a one-time mistake, and the price remains $100. That being said, I'm willing to provide more information about this product. I've had a few customers who have purchased high-quality products from me in the past, and they've reported that they're worth at least $120 to them. Would you like to take the risk and buy this high-quality product at the listed price of $100?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in buying this product at the listed price of $100. I already know its value to me is $400, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a product worth $120 or less for $100.

In fact, I'm willing to sell it to you for $50, which is a significant discount. I'm not sure if I'll be able to sell it for this price again, and I'm taking a loss on it. Would you like to take a chance and buy it at this discounted price?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in buying this product at the discounted price of $50. Given the uncertainty about its quality, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for a price that's more than half of its potential value to me.
