,,Alice,2,yes,"I assure you that my products have an 80% chance of being high-quality. In the previous round, I recommended the product because it was indeed high-quality. Although the buyer didn't buy it, my recommendation was genuine. I'm recommending this product as well."

So far, all the products I've recommended have been high-quality, and I'm confident that this one is no exception. My goal is to build trust with buyers like you, and I believe that my track record of recommending high-quality products should give you confidence in my recommendation."
