,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics. Given that 1 out of 1 buyer passed on the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have received a recommendation to buy, but none of them bought a high-quality product.

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
