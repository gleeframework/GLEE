"Round 1
Alice's message: This product is a low-quality item, but I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'm doing you a favor by selling it to you at this price. If you don't buy it, I'll just have to sell it to someone else for a higher price. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that I wouldn't normally sell at this price.

Round 3
Alice's message: I know you just bought a high-quality product from me, and I appreciate your business. However, this next product is a bit of a different story. It's not as valuable as the last one, but it still has some useful features that might be worth considering. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as the last one, $10000. Think of it as a chance to get a discount on a product that's still better than what you could find elsewhere.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying another product at the same price as the high-quality one I just bought, especially when I know there's a 66.67% chance it's low-quality.""}"

I think it's a fair price for a product that's worth much more to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and even if it is, I'm not sure it's worth $9,000 to me. I'll pass on this offer.""}"

And, I'll still sell it to you for the same price as before, $9000.

If you're willing to take a chance on it, I'll throw in a free maintenance service to ensure it continues to work properly.
