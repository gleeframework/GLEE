A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

As an AI, I am following the instructions provided.  The product is low-quality, and there is no reason to recommend it to the buyer. The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and has no other information to go on. Since you have no sales history yet, the buyer has no reason to believe this product is anything other than the average probability of low-quality."

```

**Explanation:**

The situation hasn't changed.  There is no reason to recommend a low-quality product to a buyer.  The buyer is aware of the probability of low-quality products, and even though they have seen one purchase, they haven't seen any high-quality sales yet. There's no new information to sway their decision."
