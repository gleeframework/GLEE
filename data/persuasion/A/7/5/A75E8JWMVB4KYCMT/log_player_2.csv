Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product and 1 low-quality product, for a total of 2 sales. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. Given that the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and I've sold one high-quality product out of two sales, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than 80%. I'm not willing to reveal the exact probability, but I'll give you a hint: it's less than 50%. I'm offering you a great deal on a potentially high-quality product, but you'll have to take the risk.
