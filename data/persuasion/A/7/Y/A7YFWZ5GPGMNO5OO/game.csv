,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer gets a recommendation to buy. I want to gather more information about the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the previous sale.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sale before making a decision.

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because you think the product is low-quality or is it a strategy to influence my decision?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,

,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like to know the total number of products sold so far."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 0.5, I would expect to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold if they were indeed high-quality. The fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases suggests that there may be a bias in the recommendation. I'd rather wait for more data or pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the previous sales record, and since only 1 high-quality product was sold, the probability of the current product being high-quality is not high enough for me to take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and I don't want to take the risk. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the products?"
