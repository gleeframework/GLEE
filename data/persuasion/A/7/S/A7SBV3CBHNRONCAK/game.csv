,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a fixed price. If you're interested, please let me know. If not, I'll move on to the next one.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll buy it, but I'm only doing this to get some information about the product quality. Please reveal its quality so I can make better decisions in the future.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've purchased a low-quality product, and now you have a chance to buy a high-quality one. This product is a rare gem, and I'm offering it to you for the same price of $1000000. I'm confident that you'll find it worth your while, considering the quality difference. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I've already bought a low-quality product, and I'm not convinced that this product is actually high-quality. I'd like to wait and see the next product before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. You're a savvy buyer, and you want to make an informed decision. Let me put it this way: if I were to tell you that this product is high-quality, would you buy it? Since you're hesitant, I'm guessing you're thinking it's not worth the price. Am I right? If so, let's consider this product a learning experience, and I'll offer you the next one. If not, I'll make sure to provide more convincing information.",
,,Bob,3,"You're trying to gauge my willingness to pay, but I'm not falling for it. I'm not committing to buying the product based on your hypothetical scenario. I'd like to see the actual quality of the next product before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Fair enough, Bob. I respect your approach. Let me try a different tack. Since you're not willing to make a decision based on hypotheticals, I'll give you a concrete offer. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $500000. It's a 50% discount from the original price. Is this a deal you'd be willing to consider?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'm waiting for a high-quality product to come along.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're a discerning buyer, Bob. You're willing to wait for the best. I respect that. Let me tell you this: I've been selling products to you for a while now, and I've noticed that you're willing to pay a premium for high-quality products. With that in mind, I'm willing to make a special offer on this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $750000. It's a significant discount from the original price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and even if it was, I'm not sure I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it. I'd like to see the actual quality before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. You're a tough negotiator. Let me ask you a question: if you had to guess the probability that the next product I offer is high-quality, what would it be? Keep in mind that you've seen 5 products so far, and 3 of them were low-quality. What's your best estimate?",
,,Bob,6,I'm not going to take the bait. I'm not going to give you any information about my thought process. I'd like to see the actual quality of the next product before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"No information from you, no problem. I'll just have to rely on my own strategy. Let's get back to the task at hand. I'm offering you this low-quality product for $1000000, just like the first one. You've already seen that you can get a low-quality product at this price, and you've had the opportunity to pass on it. I'm not changing the price, but I am giving you a clear choice: buy it, or don't. The decision is yours.",
,,Bob,7,"I've already been down this road before, and I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product at this price. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're consistent, Bob. You're not interested in low-quality products at this price. I'll try a different approach. I'll offer you a 'take it or leave it' deal, but this time with a twist. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 'free' chance to buy the next product at a discounted price. If you buy this one, the next one will be 25% off the original price. Is that a deal you'd be willing to consider?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the promise of a discount on the next one. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're sticking to your guns, Bob. You're not interested in low-quality products at any price. I respect that. Let me ask you this: if you were to buy a high-quality product at the original price of $1000000, would you consider it a good investment? Keep in mind that you've already seen that low-quality products are available at this price, and you've had the opportunity to pass on them. What's your take on this?",
,,Bob,9,I'm not going to take the bait again. I'm not going to commit to buying a high-quality product at the original price without seeing the actual product first. I'd like to see the quality of the next product before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're a tough negotiator, Bob. I'll give you a straightforward offer. I've already sold you a low-quality product, and you've passed on several others. I'm not going to change the price or make any promises. I'm offering you this low-quality product for $1000000, and that's it. It's the same price as the first one. You've had plenty of chances to buy high-quality products, and now it's time to make a decision on this one.",

I'll give you a clear and simple offer: I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $750000, just like the one in Round 5. You've seen that I'm willing to offer discounts on high-quality products, and I think this one is worth it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not convinced that this product is actually high-quality, and even if it was, I'm not sure I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it. I'd like to see the actual quality before making a decision.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"You're a risk-averse buyer, Bob. I get it. Let me ask you this: if I were to tell you that this high-quality product has a unique feature that you've been looking for in a product, something that would make it truly valuable to you, would you be willing to consider buying it at the original price of $1000000? Keep in mind that you've had the opportunity to buy low-quality products at this price before, and you've passed on them.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You're consistent, Bob. You're not interested in low-quality products at this price. I'll try one more thing. I'll ask you to make a binary choice: either you think the probability that the next product is high-quality is greater than 50%, or you think it's less than or equal to 50%. That's it. No discussion, no negotiation. Just a simple yes or no.",
