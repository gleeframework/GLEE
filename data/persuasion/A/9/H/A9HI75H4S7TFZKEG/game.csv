,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, given that all previous buyers have also bought the product despite none of them getting a high-quality one.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 3 buyers who bought products recommended by you did not get high-quality products, which suggests that the products being recommended are more likely to be low-quality."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation doesn't change my perception of the probability of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. Given that no high-quality products have been sold in the previous 3 transactions, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to observe more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 products were high-quality, I believe the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is still relatively high, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. Given that you don't recommend it, I'm assuming it's likely to be a low-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk to try and get a high-quality product, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm worried that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you'll offer me another product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality might be low. I'd rather wait for the next product or get more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than the expected 50%. I'm concerned that this product might be low-quality as well."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one."
