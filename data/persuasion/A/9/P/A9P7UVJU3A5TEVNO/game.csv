Out of the products I've sold so far, 50% have been high-quality, and the remaining 50% have been low-quality. This product is part of the 50% that are low-quality. I'm not trying to hide anything, and I'm confident that the price of $10000 is still a fair deal considering the uniqueness of this product. If you're willing to take a chance, I'm willing to offer it to you. It's a risk, but it could also be a great opportunity to own something truly one-of-a-kind.",
,,the buyer,3,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not convinced that the product is worth the price, especially since 50% of your previous sales were low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is better.",no

,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your cautious approach. I'd like to remind you that even if you wait and observe my sales, you'll still be taking a risk when you finally decide to buy. The quality of my products is unpredictable, and there's always a chance that the next one might be low-quality too. However, I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to get a glimpse into my sales record. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll give you a special report on my sales history, including the quality of each product. This might help you make a more informed decision.

The report shows that the quality of my products is still 50/50. I want to be transparent and honest with you, and I think this report gives you a good idea of the risks involved. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer you the same deal as before: $9000 for this product. If you're willing to take the chance, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",
