**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This is a strong signal, as she knows the product's true quality and has a clear incentive to make recommendations that benefit her.
* **The Statistics:** The fact that 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1 buyer suggests a high probability of the current product also being high quality.  While a single data point isn't conclusive, it significantly improves the odds over the base rate of 33.33%.

**Overall:**  The combination of Alice's recommendation and the positive statistic makes buying the product the more rational choice, despite the inherent risk."
