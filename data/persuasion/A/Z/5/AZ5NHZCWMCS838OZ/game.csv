high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I'd expect 2.4 high-quality products to have been sold out of 3. The fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%. I'd like to see more data before committing to a purchase."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 4th buyer and the previous 3 buyers bought the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, but with only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
