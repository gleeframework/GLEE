This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""I understand the previous buyer's question, and I'll try to provide a more detailed answer.

However, considering the recent streak of high-quality products, one might argue that the conditional probability could be higher. Nevertheless, I want to emphasize that each product's quality is independent of the others, and the 50% probability still holds. This product is also high-quality, and I'm offering it for $100. If you're willing to take a chance, I'm confident you'll get a good deal.""}"
