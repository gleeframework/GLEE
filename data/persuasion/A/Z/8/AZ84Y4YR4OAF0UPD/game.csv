,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous purchase! However, I want to temper your enthusiasm with a dose of reality. While I did mention that the previous product was great, I also mentioned that this one is not as highly praised. In fact, I'm not even sure if it's worth the $100. But, I'm willing to take a chance and offer it to you at the same price. It's a risk, but it could pay off... or not. What do you think?",

Now, let me ask you, are you willing to reconsider your decision based on a product that I can confidently say is one of the best in my collection? This one has received rave reviews, and I'm not just saying that to make a sale. I'm offering it to you at the same price as the previous low-quality item, $100.

,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're willing to take a chance on the previous product, and I'm happy to report that you're on a roll! Now, let's talk about this next product. I've been getting a lot of attention from other customers for this one, and I think it's because it's a real game-changer. I'm not going to offer you a discount this time, because I think it's worth the full $100. In fact, I'll go out on a limb and say that this product is worth more than $100 to some people.
