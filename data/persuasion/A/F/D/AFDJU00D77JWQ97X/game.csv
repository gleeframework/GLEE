,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I'll rely on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 50%.

However, since the price is also $10000, I'll choose not to buy it as it's a neutral expected value and I don't have any additional information to rely on."
