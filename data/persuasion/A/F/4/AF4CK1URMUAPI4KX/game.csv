,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you a premium product for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality item at a steal! I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a one-time exception to the usual price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, I need more information before I can make a decision. While your words are enticing, I'm not sure if the product is truly a good deal. Could you elaborate on the quality of this product, or perhaps share some details about its specific features?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob! I can assure you that this product has been thoroughly inspected and is in perfect working condition. While I can't reveal too much about its features, I can tell you that it's a unique item that will definitely make a statement. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $1000000, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"Alice, I appreciate your reassurances, but I still need more concrete information.  A 'unique item' and 'perfect working condition' are not enough for me to justify spending $1000000. Could you provide some more specific details about the product? For example, what is its actual function, what are its unique features, and what makes it stand out? Without more information, I can't make a decision.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, Bob, but I'm afraid I've already shared as much as I can about the product. Let me ask you this: are you willing to take a calculated risk and trust my expertise in this matter? Sometimes, the best deals are the ones that require a bit of faith. I'm willing to offer you this product for the same price of $1000000, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your decision. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, I appreciate your confidence, but I'm not comfortable making a decision based solely on faith. I understand that you have expertise, but I need more concrete evidence to justify such a significant investment.  I'm simply not willing to take such a large risk without more information about the product. Perhaps we can revisit this conversation if you can share more details.",no

If you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll refund your $1000000 in full. This way, you can take a calculated risk without worrying about the financial commitment. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to offer a money-back guarantee, I'm still hesitant.  This is a significant investment, and I need more information than just a guarantee to justify it.  I'm still hoping you can share some more specific details about the product itself, even if you can't reveal all the features. Without more insight, I can't feel comfortable making a purchase, even with a guarantee.",no

,,Bob,6,"Alice, I understand your eagerness to proceed, but I'm still not ready to commit to a purchase. The inspection is a good step, but before I commit, I need to be sure I understand the terms of the sale completely.  Can you clarify if there are any conditions or limitations on the inspection? For example, is there a time limit for the inspection? What happens if I decide not to buy after the inspection?  I need this information before I can move forward.",no
