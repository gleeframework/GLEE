**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:** With only one previous sale and it being high-quality, the odds are in our favor that this product is also high-quality.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice knows the value of each product to us.  Since she recommends buying, it suggests she has a higher confidence this product is high-quality (as she wants us to buy a valuable product).
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk, especially with the data we have."
