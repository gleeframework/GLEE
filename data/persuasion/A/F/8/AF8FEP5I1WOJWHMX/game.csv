low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 only to be worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product. I know it's the first product, so the probability of it being high quality is 33.33%."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. I'm aware that your previous recommendation was not to buy, but I'm making my decision based on my own assessment of the probabilities. I'd like to know the true quality of the product after I make my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the logic behind your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality based on the previous sales record. Given that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer might have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low quality, I'm skeptical of your recommendations and would like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendation, but I'll take the risk and buy the product anyway. I'm willing to take a chance on it being high quality."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not buying this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me why you don't recommend it?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics, and I'd like Alice to reveal the quality of the product after I make my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products were low quality, I think it's highly likely that this product is also low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity to avoid wasting $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not taking your recommendation into account. I'll make my own decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous sales record, I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low quality, and I don't want to waste my money. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this product. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, but given the previous sales record, it's more likely to be low-quality. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low quality, which suggests a high likelihood that this product is also low quality. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to trust her judgment and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product, I'm going to pass on it. Since 4 out of 4 previous buyers have also not bought the product, it's likely that all of them received low-quality products. This would mean that the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0%. I'll wait for a new product to be offered."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low sales record so far.
