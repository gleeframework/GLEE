,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision, but since I don't have any information about the previous product's quality, I'll make a decision based on the fact that the first buyer passed on the product. This might indicate that the product is low-quality."

,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than 50%. I'll take a chance and pass on this one."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, considering the previous sales record. I'm not convinced by your recommendation yet."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 50%. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous products were low quality, I'm going to assume the probability of a high-quality product has increased, and the probability of a low-quality product has decreased. I'll pass on this one to see if the trend continues."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 products recommended were not high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall proportion. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next one is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, I don't think Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'll take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know what the previous 6 buyers' experiences were with the products they were offered. Were they all low-quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers bought the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products being offered are low-quality. I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers bought the product despite no high-quality products being sold is suspicious. It seems like the previous buyers were either not paying attention to the quality or were not aware of the true value of the product. I'm going to take a chance and pass on it to see if the pattern holds.
