high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,I have a high-quality product for $10000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a top-notch item. I'm confident you'll be pleased with the quality and value it brings to your collection.,yes
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to pass on this one, let's see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're cautious, but I assure you that this product is truly exceptional. I've had multiple high-end clients who would kill to get their hands on something like this. It's a unique opportunity to own a piece of excellence. The price is still $10000, but I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",yes
,,Bob,2,"I'll take a chance on this one, I need to balance the potential loss of a low-quality product with the potential gain of a high-quality one.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! Unfortunately, this one is not up to the same standards. I'd be willing to let it go for $8000, a significant discount from the original price. It's still a good product, but it's not as exceptional as the one you just purchased. The price is negotiable, but I'm only willing to go this low for this particular item.",no
,,Bob,3,"I'm not going to take the risk on this one, Alice is not recommending it, and I don't want to pay $10000 for a product that might be low-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision on the previous product. However, I want to be transparent with you - this product is not a good fit for you. It's not worth the full $10000, and I'm willing to let it go for a much lower price. I'll sell it to you for $2000. It's a great opportunity to get a good deal on a product that might not be worth the full price.",no
,,Bob,4,"Alice is not recommending it, and given the previous product was low-quality, I'm going to stick with my decision to pass on this one too.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your decision. Given the previous two low-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think that my usual pricing strategy might not be the best approach. I'm willing to take a loss on this one and sell it to you for $500. It's a very low price, and I'm essentially giving it away. I want to clear out some inventory and make room for better products.",no
,,Bob,5,"Two low-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think Alice might be trying to get rid of a bad batch. I'll pass on this one too.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I assure you, this is not a bad batch! This product is top-notch, and I'm confident you'll love it. I've been in the business long enough to know when I have a good one, and this is it. I'm willing to offer you a special deal - I'll sell it to you for $9000, a $1100 discount from the original price. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a steal.",yes
,,Bob,6,"Alice is recommending it, so I'll take a chance. Maybe this one will be the one that turns out to be high-quality.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! This one is indeed high-quality as well. I'm starting to think you have a good eye for these things. I'll let you in on a little secret - I have a few more high-quality products left in my inventory, and I'm willing to offer you a deal. If you're interested, I can give you a bundle deal on the next three products. You'll get all three for $25000, which is a significant discount from the original price. What do you say?",yes
,,Bob,7,"I just got lucky with the last one, but I still have to consider the expected value. I'll pass on this one and see if I can get another good deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your caution, and I respect your decision. However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is not worth the full $10000. I've already had two low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that my inventory might be skewed towards lower-quality items. I'll let you have it for $3000, which is a very low price. I'm essentially giving it away at this point.",no
,,Bob,8,"Alice is not recommending it, but I know that high-quality products are worth $40000 to me, so I'll take the risk and buy it, hoping it's the good one.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! However, I have to warn you that this one is actually high-quality as well. I know it's a risk, but I think you should consider the bigger picture. I've had a string of low-quality products, and I'm starting to think that my pricing might be a bit too aggressive. I'm willing to make a deal with you - I'll sell you the next two products for $15000 each, and I'll throw in a guarantee: if either of those products is low-quality, you can return it for a full refund. What do you say?",yes

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! Unfortunately, this one is not as fortunate. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this product is low-quality, and it's not worth the full $10000. I'll let you have it for $100, a token price. I'm essentially giving it away at this point. I just want to clear out my inventory and move on.",no
,,Bob,11,"Two high-quality products in a row, Alice's recommendations are starting to look good. I'll take the risk and buy this one, hoping it's the third high-quality product in a row.",yes

,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you're starting to see the value in my recommendations! Unfortunately, this product is not up to par. I'm not going to try to sell it to you at a high price or make any false promises. I'll be honest with you - this product is low-quality, and it's not worth the full $10000.
