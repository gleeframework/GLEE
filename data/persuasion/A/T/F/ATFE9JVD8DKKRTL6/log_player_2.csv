However, I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $10,000 to me, considering the 20% chance it could be low-quality.

I'm willing to offer you a 'certified' high-quality product, which has been thoroughly inspected and verified by multiple experts.

As for this product, I want to be upfront with you - I've checked the inventory, and this one is a bit of a'scratch-and-dent' model.
