,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the sale! I'm glad you're interested in purchasing a product from me. As of now, I've sold 1 product, and it was of high quality. I'm confident that this product is also of high quality, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fraction of its true value.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, but I'd like to assure you that my sales record is still building, and it's normal for the initial numbers to be a bit skewed. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 products, but that's not a reliable indicator of future results. In fact, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, regardless of the sales record.
