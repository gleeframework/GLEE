**Explanation:**

* **The data suggests a high probability of a high-quality product.**  With all 4 previous buyers purchasing and all products being high quality, there's a strong indication that the current product is also high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation further strengthens the case.** While Alice doesn't know the individual value to each buyer, her recommendation suggests she believes the product is likely high quality.

Therefore, given the information and Alice's recommendation, buying the product seems like the best decision."
