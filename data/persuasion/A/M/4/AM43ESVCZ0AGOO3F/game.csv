,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'm willing to give you a little more information to alleviate your concerns. I can tell you that this product has received rave reviews from other customers, and its quality is unparalleled in the market. In fact, I've had to turn away several other buyers who were willing to pay even more than $1000000 for it. I'm making a significant concession by offering it to you at this price. If you're still hesitant, I can offer to let you inspect the product before making a decision. What do you think?",

That's right, I'll sell it to you for $1000000, no questions asked, no returns, no refunds. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take the risk because I believe in the potential of this product.
