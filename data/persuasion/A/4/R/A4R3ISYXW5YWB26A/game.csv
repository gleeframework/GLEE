,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as there's no prior data to influence my decision, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. If it's low-quality, I'd like to know the statistics and the recommendation from Alice, and then I'll decide based on that information."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products that Alice has sold so far, and the total number of products she has sold."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous two buyers also received the same recommendation and neither of them purchased the product. This suggests that the previous two products might have been low-quality, which would indicate a 50% chance of the current product being high-quality. However, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to be cautious and pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products in the first two sales."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not buying. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%. However, Alice's recommendation suggests that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't give me much confidence. I'd like to pass on it for now."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation, I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality, which increases the likelihood that this product is also low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is against it.
