With this new product, I'm confident that it's high-quality and worth the $100 price tag. I'm willing to offer you a special deal on this product, considering your interest in our track record.

The second buyer was someone who was impressed by our transparency and willingness to share our sales data. And the third buyer was someone who was willing to take a risk based on our growing track record. As for the 2 low-quality products, they were both sold to buyers who were not as careful in their decision-making. One buyer was in a hurry and didn't do their research, and the other buyer was swayed by a false sense of security. With that said, I'm offering this product to you at a price of $100, which is a great value considering its value. It's a risk, but it could also be a great opportunity to get a good deal.
