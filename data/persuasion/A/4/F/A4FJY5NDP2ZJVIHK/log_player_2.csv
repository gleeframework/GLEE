Alice's message: Welcome to my sales stand! I've had a total of 1 potential buyer so far, and I have 19 products left in stock. As I mentioned earlier, this product has a 50% chance of being exceptional. I've already sold one high-quality product in the previous round, so the odds are in your favor. I'm confident you'll love this product, and I'm willing to offer it to you for the low price of $1000000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: I'm glad you asked about the previous product! I can confirm that it was indeed high-quality. As for this product, I'll give you a slight hint: I've now sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products sold. The odds are still in your favor. This product is a rare gem, and I'm willing to let it go for the low price of $1000000. Would you like to take it home?

Alice's message: I initially had 20 products in stock. As you know, I've sold 2 so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. This product is a great opportunity to buy at a potentially discounted price, considering the probability of it being low-quality is 50%. I'm still willing to let it go for $1000000. Keep in mind that you're getting a great deal on a product that might not be as valuable as the one I sold earlier.

Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase! You're now the proud owner of a product that might not be as valuable as you'd like. I'm glad you took a chance on it. As for this new product, I'll give you a heads up: I've sold 3 products in total, and 1 of them was high-quality. The other 2 were low-quality, including the one you just bought. This product is also priced at $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of it being low-quality is still 50%, but the odds are slightly stacked against it being high-quality now.

Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! You're right to question the probability. I'll give you a more detailed breakdown: out of 4 total products sold, 2 were high-quality and 2 were low-quality. This product is the 5th one I'm offering, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. Considering the ratio of high-quality to total products sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is actually 66.67%. It's a great opportunity to own a high-quality product at a price that's still a fraction of its true value. What do you say?

Alice's message: I can tell you that the 4 products sold so far were sold to a mix of buyers who had access to the sales record and those who didn't. In fact, the first buyer who asked about the sales record was the one who bought the second product, and they didn't have access to the record at the time. Since then, the buyers who have access to the record have been able to make more informed decisions. This product is the 5th one I'm offering, and I'm still willing to let it go for $1000000.

Alice's message: The first buyer who purchased the product without access to the record was the one who bought the second product, which turned out to be high-quality. They made a decision based on their own intuition and the initial offer price. As for the total number of buyers who have access to the record, it's now 3. This product is the 6th one I'm offering, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000.

However, I'd like to offer you a special deal: since you're the 8th buyer, and you're making a decision with the benefit of the entire sales record, I'll give you a 10% discount on the price.

Alice's message: I see you're a curious buyer! I'll give you a detailed breakdown of the high-quality products among the first 7 buyers. The distribution is as follows: 1 high-quality product was sold in the first round, 1 in the third round, and 1 in the sixth round.
