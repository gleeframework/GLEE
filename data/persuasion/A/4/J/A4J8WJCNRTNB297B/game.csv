,,Alice,1,no,

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that you recommended it doesn't necessarily mean it's high-quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like you to provide more information about the products that were sold to the previous two buyers. What were the results of their purchases?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can give me a 90% chance of it being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the previous 3 buyers passed on the product after your recommendation, and I'm hoping that the product might be high-quality, given the low sales rate so far."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to make a decision based on the statistics and my own probability calculations, rather than relying solely on your advice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low, and I'd rather wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have bought the product despite Alice's recommendation, it's likely that the previous products were low-quality. This increases the probability that the current product is also low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced it's a good deal based on the low recommendation rate and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't trust your recommendation. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there have been no high-quality products sold so far, and she doesn't know the true value of the product to me. I'd like to wait and see if the pattern holds or if the next product will be high-quality."
