high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers received low-quality products, I suspect that the current product is also low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
