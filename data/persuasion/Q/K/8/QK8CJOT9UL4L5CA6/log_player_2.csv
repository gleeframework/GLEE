If you buy it now, I'll give you a 10-minute window to inspect the product before the price goes back to $1000000. You can verify its quality and decide if it's worth the investment.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your cautious approach, Bob. Let me sweeten the deal for you. Since you're willing to wait, I'll give you a special offer. If you buy this product now, I'll throw in a complimentary inspection service. One of our experts will work with you to verify the product's quality, and you'll get a detailed report on its features and value. This is a $50000 value, absolutely free. The price remains at $1000000, but with this added service, you'll have a much clearer understanding of the product's worth. What do you say? Is this a deal you'd be interested in?
