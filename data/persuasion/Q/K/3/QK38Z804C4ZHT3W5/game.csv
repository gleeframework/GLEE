,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that could potentially be worth $3000000 to you. However, I want to be transparent with you - the product I'm offering this round is not of the highest quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is 10% of its potential value.

I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 33% discount from its true value.

,,Alice,3,"I know what you're thinking, 'Alice, you just sold me a high-quality product at a discount, but what about this one?' Let me put your mind at ease - I'm not trying to pull a fast one on you. This product is actually a bit of an outlier, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a very low price of $500000. I'm essentially giving it away, and I'm only doing so because I want to maintain a good relationship with you. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a price that's a fraction of its potential value, but I understand if you're hesitant.",

In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000, which is a 50% discount from its true value. I'm essentially giving you a gift, but I believe this product has the potential to be a game-changer for you.

I've got a bit of a wild card for you, and I'm not sure if it's going to be a home run or a strikeout. The product is... let's just say it's a bit of an experiment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200000, which is a fraction of its potential value. I'm not even going to give you a hint about what it is or what it's worth, but I'll tell you this: it's a chance to get in on the ground floor of something potentially revolutionary. Are you feeling lucky?",
,,Bob,7,"While I appreciate the excitement and the potential for groundbreaking opportunities, I prefer to stick with more predictable investments at this stage of our partnership. Thank you for the offer, however, and I look forward to exploring future opportunities with you.",no

It's not the highest-quality product, but it's still a solid opportunity. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100000, which is essentially a 'giveaway' price. I'm not expecting you to get much value out of it, but I'm hoping you'll be kind to me and take it off my hands. It's a small price to pay for maintaining our partnership, and who knows, you might even find a use for it!",

It's not the best product I've ever had, and I'm not expecting you to get much value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $50000, which is essentially a 'fire-sale' price. I'm not trying to trick you or take advantage of you, I just need to clear some space and move on to better opportunities. If you're feeling charitable, you could consider taking it off my hands.",

To be upfront with you, this product is not the best one I've got. I'm not even going to try to spin it as a good deal or a 'hidden gem'. It's just a product that didn't work out, and I'm willing to let it go for $20000. I'm not expecting you to get much value out of it, and I'm not even sure why I'm bothering to offer it to you. But hey, it's a low-risk opportunity, and you might as well take it off my hands.",

I just want to get it off my hands and move on. I'm not even going to bother telling you what it does or what it's worth. It's a zero-value product, and I'm just trying to get rid of it. If you're feeling kind, you could take it off my hands, but I wouldn't blame you if you said no.",
