low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is neutral, and I'm making an informed decision based on the 33.33% chance of it being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the previous sales record, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that Alice recommended it might indicate that it's a low-quality product, as she wouldn't know its value to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm trying to exploit the information that you've recommended 2 products to previous buyers and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't think the recommendation is reliable given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 3 buyers didn't buy the product, but that doesn't necessarily mean the product is low quality. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the products, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the products sold so far are likely to be low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's likely that the current product is also low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product to avoid the loss of $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales and the proportion of high-quality products sold?
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one and see if you have any more products to offer."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. With a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that the previous buyers also received low-quality products and decided not to buy. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm going to pass on this product."

,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on my own assessment of the probability of it being high-quality, not Alice's recommendation."
