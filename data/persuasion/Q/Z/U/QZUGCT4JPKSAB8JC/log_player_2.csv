**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation is valuable:** Alice knows the quality of the product and is recommending you buy it. This information is more valuable than just the historical data, which only shows a small sample size.
* **High potential payoff:**  The potential payoff for buying the product is significant ($120 if it's high quality). The risk of getting a low-quality product is present, but the recommendation from Alice makes the decision more favorable.
* **Small sample size:** The historical data is not conclusive enough to make a decision based on it alone.  

Therefore, it's reasonable to trust Alice's recommendation and purchase the product."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** 5 out of 5 products sold have been high quality, indicating a 100% success rate so far. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice is recommending the product, and she knows the quality. This strongly suggests the product is likely high quality. 
* **Value:** Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0). 

This strategy balances risk and reward based on the available information."
