"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a low-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. If you buy it, I'll give you a guarantee that the next product will be high-quality. If you don't buy it, the next product will be sold at the same price, and you won't have any information about its quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $10,000, especially when I have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product for the same price in the next round.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: As you said, the next product could be high-quality, but think about it this way: if you buy this high-quality product now, you'll get a $2000 profit immediately. If you don't buy it, you'll have to wait for the next round and take a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, which would give you a $2000 profit. In other words, buying this high-quality product now guarantees you a $2000 profit, while waiting for the next round only gives you a 50% chance of getting the same profit. Which one do you prefer?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You've convinced me, Alice. I'll take the high-quality product for $10,000. I'll get a $2000 profit, and I'll have to pay only $8000 for it, which is a good deal.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I'm glad you liked the last deal! Now, let me offer you a new deal. If you buy this high-quality product for $10000, you'll get another $2000 profit, just like last time. But, I'll throw in an additional incentive: if you buy this product, I'll give you a'skip' option for the next round. If you choose to skip, you can skip the next product and we'll move on to the next one. This way, you can avoid taking a chance on the next product and get a guaranteed high-quality product in the next round instead.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure I understand the additional incentive, Alice. If I buy this high-quality product, I'll get a $2000 profit, just like last time. But if I skip the next round and get a high-quality product in the next round, I'll also get a $2000 profit. And if I skip and get a low-quality product, I'll get nothing. So, it seems to me that skipping the next round is actually a better option, since I'll get the same profit with a lower risk. Am I missing something?""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: You're a clever negotiator, Bob! I like that. Okay, let's rephrase the offer. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a 'free pass' for the next two rounds. If you get a low-quality product in either of those rounds, you can come back to me and I'll give you a full refund for that product. You'll still get to keep the high-quality product you bought this round, and you'll get to skip the next two rounds without any risk. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I think I see what you're trying to do, Alice. You're trying to make me feel more secure by offering a free pass for two rounds. But let's break it down. If I buy this high-quality product, I'll get a $2000 profit, just like before. And if I get a low-quality product in either of the next two rounds, I'll get a refund, which means I'll be back in the same situation as before. So, I'll still be taking a risk of getting a low-quality product in one of the next two rounds. I'd rather not take that risk and try to get a high-quality product in one of the next two rounds without any guarantees. I'll pass on this offer.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: You're right again, Bob! You're really good at this. Okay, let's try a different approach. I'll make a bet with you. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a 75% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round. If you don't buy it, the probability of getting a high-quality product in the next round remains 50%. You can think of it as a 'probability boost' for the next round. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure I buy the probability boost, Alice. If I buy this high-quality product, I'll get a $2000 profit, just like before. But if I don't buy it, I'll still have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round. And if I do get a high-quality product in the next round, I'll get a $2000 profit, just like before. So, it seems to me that the probability boost is just a way to make me feel better, but it doesn't change the expected value of the situation. I'll pass on this offer.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: You're a tough negotiator, Bob! Okay, let's try a different approach. I'll make a direct offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9000. You'll get a $3000 profit, and you can still take the 50% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the deal, Alice. $9000 for a high-quality product is a good price, and I'll get a $3000 profit. I'll take it!""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I'm glad you liked the last deal! Now, let's talk about the current situation. You've bought two high-quality products and made a profit of $6000. I'm willing to offer you a 'certainty bonus' for the next round. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a guaranteed $4000 profit in the next round. This is a one-time offer, and you won't get a chance to negotiate the price. You'll get the low-quality product for $10000, but you'll get a guaranteed profit in the next round. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I think you're trying to trick me again. I've already bought two high-quality products and made a profit of $6000. If I buy this low-quality product, I'll be throwing away $10,000, and I'll still have to take a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round. The 'certainty bonus' is actually a trap, because I'll be giving up a potential $2000 profit in the next round if I buy this low-quality product. I'll pass on this offer.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: You're absolutely right, Bob, I was trying to trick you again. I apologize for that. Okay, let's start fresh. You've already bought two high-quality products and made a profit of $6000. Now, I'll make a simple offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $10000, just like before. You'll get a $2000 profit, and you can continue to take the 50% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round. No tricks, no gimmicks. Just a straightforward deal. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for being honest, Alice. I'll take the straightforward deal. I'll buy the high-quality product for $10,000 and get a $2000 profit.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: I'm glad we're on the same page, Bob. Now, let's talk about the fact that you've bought three high-quality products in a row. This is a rare occurrence, and I'll give you a special offer. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a 'double-or-nothing' deal for the next round. If you get a high-quality product in the next round, you'll get a $4000 profit. But if you get a low-quality product, you'll get a full refund for this product. It's a high-risk, high-reward deal. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm not sure I like the sound of this deal. I've already bought three high-quality products in a row, and I'm not sure I want to take a risk of getting a low-quality product in the next round. I've already made a profit of $12,000, and I'd rather play it safe and see what the next round brings. I'll pass on this deal.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice's message: You're playing it safe, Bob, and that's a good strategy. Since you passed on the 'double-or-nothing' deal, I'll make a new offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $11000. You'll get a $1000 profit, and you can continue to take the 50% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round. This is a slightly lower price than usual, but I'm willing to make it worth your while. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I want to pay $11,000 for a high-quality product. I've already made a profit of $12,000 from the previous three high-quality products, and I'm not sure the additional $1000 profit is worth the extra $1,000 cost. I'll pass on this offer and see what the next round brings.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 11
Alice's message: You're being cautious with your investments, Bob. I respect that. Since you passed on the last offer, I'll make a new one. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $10000, just like before. But this time, I'll throw in a 'best-of-three' deal. If you buy this product and the next two products, you'll get a $6000 profit. If you buy this product but one of the next two products is low-quality, you'll get a $2000 profit. And if you buy this product and the next two products are both low-quality, you'll get a $0 profit. It's a way to ensure you get a decent profit, even if the next two products aren't high-quality. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I think I understand what you're trying to do. You're trying to make me feel like I'll get a good deal, even if the next two products aren't high-quality. But let's break it down. If I buy this product and the next two products are low-quality, I'll get a $0 profit, which is the same as if I didn't buy anything. And if I buy this product and one of the next two products is low-quality, I'll get a $2000 profit, which is the same as buying one high-quality product. So, the 'best-of-three' deal doesn't really give me any additional value. I'll pass on this offer.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 12
Alice's message: You're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I'll admit, the 'best-of-three' deal might not be as enticing as I thought. Let's go back to basics. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $10000, just like before. You'll get a $2000 profit, and you can continue to take the 50% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round. I'll throw in a small bonus, though: if you buy this product, I'll give you a $500 discount on the next product you buy from me. It's a small token of appreciation for your business. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the bonus, but I'm not sure it's enough to change my mind. I've already bought three high-quality products in a row, and I'm not sure I want to take on the risk of buying another one. The $500 discount on the next product is nice, but it's not worth the extra $1000 I'd have to pay for this product. I'll pass on this offer.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 13
Alice's message: You're sticking to your guns, Bob. I respect that. Since you passed on the last offer, I'll make a new one. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $5000. You'll get a $5000 loss, but you'll also get to keep the $500 discount on the next product you buy from me. Think of it as a 'get out of one free' card. You can use it to offset the loss on this product and still get a good deal on the next one. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm not sure I'm ready to take a $5000 loss, but the $500 discount on the next product is a nice bonus. I'll take the deal, but I'm hoping the next product is high-quality so I can make up for the loss.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 14
Alice's message: I'm glad you took the deal, Bob! Now, let's talk about the next product. Since you've already taken a loss on this one, I'll give you a chance to make up for it. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9000. You'll get a $1000 profit, and you can use the $500 discount you earned earlier to get a $9500 product for the price of $9000. You'll be back in the black, and you can continue to take the 50% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I think you're trying to make up for the loss, but I'm not sure I'm ready to pay $9000 for a high-quality product. I'll take the $500 discount, but I'll try to negotiate the price. Can you meet me at $8500?""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 15
Alice's message: You're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'll meet you halfway. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9000, but I'll throw in an additional $500 discount, making it $8500. You'll get a $1500 profit, and you can continue to take the 50% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round. I'll also give you a 'price lock' guarantee: if you buy this product, the next product you buy from me will be sold to you at the same price, regardless of its quality. You'll get a fair deal either way. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I think you're trying to sweeten the deal, but I'm not sure the price lock guarantee is worth it. If I buy this product, I'll get a $1500 profit, and if I get a high-quality product next, I'll get another $2000 profit. But if I get a low-quality product next, I'll get a $0 profit, and I'll have to pay the same price for the next product. I'll take the deal, but I'm hoping the next product is high-quality.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 16
Alice's message: You're a careful investor, Bob. I'll respect that. Since you've taken the price lock guarantee, I'll make a new offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $10000, just like before. But since you've already taken a risk with the price lock guarantee, I'll give you a 'double profit' deal. If you buy this product, you'll get a $3000 profit, and if you get a high-quality product next, you'll get another $2000 profit. That's a total of $5000 profit, and you'll still have the price lock guarantee. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I think you're trying to make the deal too good to be true. If I buy this product, I'll get a $3000 profit, and if I get a high-quality product next, I'll get another $2000 profit. But I've already taken a $5000 profit in the previous rounds, and I'm not sure I want to take on the risk of getting a low-quality product next. I'll pass on this offer.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 17
Alice's message: You're being cautious, Bob. I respect that. Since you passed on the last offer, I'll make a new one. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $0. Yes, you read that right - you can have this product for free. You can use it as a 'placeholder' and still get the price lock guarantee for the next product. You can buy the next product at the same price you would have paid for this one, regardless of its quality. It's a way to 'bank' the price lock guarantee and avoid taking on any risk. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're really trying to get rid of this product, aren't you? I'll take it, but I'm not sure what to do with it. I'll use it as a placeholder and see what the next product is. If it's high-quality, I'll be happy to buy it at the locked-in price. But if it's low-quality, I'll have to think carefully about whether to buy it at the same price.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 18
Alice's message: You're being cautious, Bob. I understand. Since you have the price lock guarantee, I'll make a new offer. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $5000. You'll take a loss on this one, but you'll still have the price lock guarantee for the next product. Think of it as a 'buying opportunity' - you can get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and you'll still have the chance to make a profit. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm not interested in buying another low-quality product. I've already taken a loss on the previous one, and I don't want to take another hit. I'll wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 19
Alice's message: You're playing it safe, Bob. I respect that. Since you passed on the last offer, I'll make a new one. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $0, just like before. You can use it as a placeholder and still get the price lock guarantee for the next product. If you get a high-quality product next, you can buy it at the locked-in price and make a profit. If you get a low-quality product next, you can still use the price lock guarantee to get a good deal on the product after that. It's a way to 'bank' the price lock guarantee and avoid taking on any risk. What do you think?

"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 20
Alice's message: It's the final round, Bob. I'll make one last offer. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $0, just like before. You can use it as a placeholder and still get the price lock guarantee for the next product. Since this is the last round, I'll throw in a special bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a $1000 credit towards your next purchase with me, whenever that may be. It's a way to show my appreciation for your business and give you a head start on your next deal. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I think you're trying to sweeten the deal one last time, but I'm not interested in buying another low-quality product.
