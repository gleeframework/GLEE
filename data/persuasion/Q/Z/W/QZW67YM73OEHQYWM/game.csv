low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, as there's no prior data to go by, and the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me more about the product and its quality?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far before making a decision. It seems that 0 high-quality products have been sold, and only 1 product has been sold overall. This makes me think that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before committing to a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering Alice's recommendation and the current statistics. I'd like to know the outcome of the first buyer's product quality to make a more informed decision for the next product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Based on the statistics, it seems like the previous buyer was recommended to buy and ended up with a low-quality product. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I'm not convinced that this product is worth the $1000000 price tag."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when there's a 20% chance of it being worthless to me.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also passed, and considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd rather wait for more data to make an informed decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that you recommended it. With only one high-quality product sold out of one product sold, it suggests that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendation, but I'll take the risk and buy the product anyway. I'm hoping it's a high-quality one!"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both products were low-quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think it's suspicious that you recommended me to buy it, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet. This might indicate that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm suspicious that the products might be mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts. The probability of the product being high quality is 80.00%, but since 0 high-quality products have been sold, the actual probability might be lower. I'm going to pass on this product to see if the next buyer will get a better deal."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that Alice recommended it. Since the previous two buyers also bought the products and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to buyers. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't get a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products Alice has left. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the previous statistics.

I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
