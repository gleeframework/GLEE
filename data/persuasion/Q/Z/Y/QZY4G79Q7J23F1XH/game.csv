,,Alice,7,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 100%. This seems suspiciously high, and I'm not convinced that the product I'm being offered is actually high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, and Alice's recommendation being to buy, I think the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product and get more information."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,

,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product, the proportion of high-quality products is 100%. This is likely an anomaly, and I suspect that the remaining product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that Alice has already sold one high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of the next product being high-quality might be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 out of 1 product was high-quality, the probability of the product being low-quality is still 50%, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
