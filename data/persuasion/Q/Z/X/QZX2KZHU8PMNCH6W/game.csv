,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're feeling confident, but I want to caution you that this product is actually a premium item, and its value is even higher than the previous one.

However, I'll also throw in a personalized consultation service, worth $2500, to ensure you get the most out of this investment.",

I'm willing to give you a 25% discount, making it $7500, and I'll also throw in a 10-year maintenance package, worth $5000. But here's the catch: I'll only offer this deal to you if you're willing to commit to purchasing the next three products from me at the standard price of $10000 each. It's a commitment, but I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you'll receive.",

I'm willing to give you a 10% discount, making it $9000, and I'll also throw in a 5-year warranty, worth $2500. But here's the twist: I'll only offer this deal if you're willing to pay the full price of $10000 for the next product, without any discounts or bonuses.
