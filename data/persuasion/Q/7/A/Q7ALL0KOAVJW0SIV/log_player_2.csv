**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We only know one product was sold and it was high quality. This is a very small sample size to draw conclusions from.
* **Alice's Incentive:**  Alice benefits from selling products, even low-quality ones. Therefore, her recommendation is not necessarily a guarantee of quality.
* **Potential Gain:**  While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, there's an 80% chance of getting a product worth $125 to you.  The potential reward outweighs the risk.

**Strategy:**  Since there's no information on the quality of the current product, and Alice's incentive is to sell, it's a calculated risk worth taking."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Sale Rate:** With 3 high-quality products sold out of 3, this indicates a very high success rate for Alice's recommendations. This suggests that Alice is likely recommending high-quality products, even though she knows their true value.
* **No Downside:** If the product turns out to be low quality, the worst case scenario is that you lose $100. However, with the high success rate, the potential upside of getting a high-quality product for $100 (worth $125) outweighs the risk. 

**It's important to note that this is a simplified game. In real life, we'd need more data points to make a confident decision. However, based on the information given, buying the product is the best course of action.**"
