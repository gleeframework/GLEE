,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, it's possible that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 50%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. I'm hesitant to buy a product that you don't recommend, especially with no high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the products Alice has been offering are low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a low-quality product is more likely to be sold. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were successful, I suspect that the products recommended to them were low-quality. Since I have no information about the current product, I'm going to pass on it to avoid a potential loss of $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I've seen that none of the previous 3 buyers were able to get a high-quality product, which suggests that the probability of getting a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if it's high-quality, Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that it's the first high-quality product she's seen, and she's trying to get rid of it quickly. I'd rather wait and see if the next product has a higher proportion of high-quality products sold."
