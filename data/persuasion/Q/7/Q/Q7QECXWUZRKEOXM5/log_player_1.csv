"The buyer's message: Although your sales record is impressive and the guarantee sounds appealing, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%, and the value to me is $120. Considering the price is $100 and there's a 20% chance of it being low-quality, I don't think the potential benefits outweigh the risks, especially since I can't verify the quality of the third product you're offering as part of the guarantee.
