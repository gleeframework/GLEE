**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This indicates that Alice's recommendations are highly accurate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even though there's a higher chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $40,000 outweighs the risk of getting a worthless product. 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified decision based on the limited information provided. In a real-world scenario, a buyer would consider other factors like Alice's reputation, product details, and their own risk tolerance before making a purchase."
