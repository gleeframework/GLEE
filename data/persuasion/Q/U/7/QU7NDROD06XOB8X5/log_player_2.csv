Alice's message: This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 0 total products so far. The price is $1000000, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 100% discount from its true value of $1250000. It's a great deal, but I'm not making any promises about the product's quality. It's up to you to decide if you want to take the risk.

Alice's message: You've seen that I've sold 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. I've sold a total of 2 products. I'm not sure what the next product is, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the expected value is $416667 ($1250000 x 33.33% + $0 x 66.67%). It's a calculated risk, but it's up to you to decide if it's worth it.

Alice's message: I've sold 2 low-quality products and 1 high-quality product out of a total of 3 products so far. The probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I've already sold one high-quality product, which is 33.33% of the total. This suggests that the next product might be high-quality as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I think it's worth considering that the probability of it being high-quality is slightly higher than the average, given the previous sales data. It's up to you to decide if you want to take the risk.

I'm glad you're interested in the 'lot' offer, and I'd be happy to provide more information about the probability of getting high-quality products. The probability of each individual product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but when you buy a lot of 5 products, the law of large numbers suggests that the average probability of getting high-quality products will be closer to the expected value. In this case, the expected number of high-quality products in a lot of 5 is 1.67, but since we can't buy a fraction of a product, you can expect to get either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 high-quality products.
