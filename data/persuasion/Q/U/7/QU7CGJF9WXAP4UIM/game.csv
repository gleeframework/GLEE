low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns and hesitation. Let me be transparent with you - I've had a string of low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that my usual supplier might be having a bad run. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $50, which is half the usual price. I'm taking a loss on this one, but I want to clear out some inventory and make room for better products. Would you consider buying it at this discounted price?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm still not willing to pay $50 for a product that's worth $0 to me, even if it's at a discounted price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm starting to think that I should just be upfront with you. Look, this product is low-quality, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it. I'm not going to try to sell it to you at a discount or with a guarantee. I'm just going to tell you that it's not worth the $100 price tag, and you'd be wasting your money. But if you're feeling generous and want to help me out, I'd be willing to sell it to you for $1. That's right, I'll take a $99 loss on this one just to get it off my hands. Would you like to take pity on me and buy it?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not going to pay $1 for a product that's worth $0 to me, even if it's to help you out.",no

,,Alice,6,"I've run out of tricks and offers. I'm just going to be honest with you - I don't have any product that's worth $100 to sell to you right now. But I do have a product that's worth $100 to me, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a low-quality product, but I'm not going to try to hide it from you.
