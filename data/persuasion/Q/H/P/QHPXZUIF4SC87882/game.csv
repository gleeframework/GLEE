,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice doesn't recommend it. Given the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%, which would make the risk of buying a low-quality product higher than the potential reward of buying a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the probability of this product being high-quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm taking a chance that the product might be high quality, and I'm willing to take the risk given the low price of $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the probability of it being high-quality, not your recommendation. I'm aware that you know the true quality of the product and are trying to influence my decision, but I'm going to make my decision based on the odds."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. I'm aware of the 0/5 sales record, which suggests a high probability of a low-quality product. However, I'd like to take the risk and buy it, hoping it's the one high-quality product that's been hidden so far."

,,Alice,17,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
