high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the product is low-quality, in which case it won't cost me much, and if it's high-quality, I'll get a great deal. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to take a chance."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the low success rate of high-quality products so far. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm inclined to think it's low quality. Given the 2 previous buyers also bought the products and no high-quality products were sold, I'm going to pass on this product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll make my decision based on the statistics and the odds of it being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to ask, how many products have been offered in total so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice is recommending it. Since she's not recommending it, I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it's likely that the previous products were low-quality. With a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm skeptical about the current product and would rather wait for more information or pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. With 5 buyers having purchased and no high-quality products sold, I'm assuming the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers purchased the products, and none of them were high-quality, it seems like Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is likely a result of the previous 5 buyers all getting low-quality products. I'm hoping to be the exception."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, given the low probability of it being high quality and the fact that none have been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that 7 out of 7 buyers have passed on the product, it seems like they were all low-quality. I'm hoping to be the first to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there something specific that led you to advise me not to buy it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the lack of recommendations might indicate a higher chance of it being low quality, but I'm aware that's a flawed reasoning."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the statistics and Alice's recommendation. Given that 10 previous buyers have passed on the product after her recommendation, and none of the products sold were high-quality, it seems that Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'd rather not take the risk."
