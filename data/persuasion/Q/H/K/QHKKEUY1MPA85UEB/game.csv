,,Alice,1,"You are one of the first 20 buyers. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. I have sold 0 products so far, and I know that 1 out of the first 1 products is high-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for a fixed price of $1000000. If you buy this product, you will get a high-quality product with a 33.33% chance. If you don't buy this product, I'll keep selling to the next buyer. The price is final, and the product is non-refundable after purchase.",
,,the buyer,1,I am interested in purchasing the product as I understand the risk involved with the quality.,yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! You're aware that the previous product was high-quality. I've now sold 1 product, and I know that 2 out of the first 2 products are high-quality. I'm offering this new product to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, since 2 out of the first 2 products were high-quality, you might want to consider that the next product could also be high-quality. The price is still $1000000, and it's a one-time offer. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,2,"Considering the previous successes and the probability, I believe the investment is worth the risk.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've seen two high-quality products in a row, which is a remarkable streak! However, remember that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I've now sold 2 products, and 2 out of the first 3 products are high-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. But I want to offer you a special deal: I'll give you a 50/50 chance of getting the product for $750000. If you choose this option, you'll pay $750000 and get a product that is either high-quality or low-quality. If you don't choose this option, you'll buy the product at the regular price of $1000000. What would you prefer?",
,,the buyer,3,"I accept the special deal. Thank you for the offer, Alice. I am willing to pay $750000 for the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome to the fourth round! I've sold 3 products, and 2 of them were high-quality. I'm now offering you this new product for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and the previous product was low-quality. I want to remind you that I've been transparent about the sales so far, and I'm willing to continue being transparent. I've sold 3 products, and 2 of them were high-quality. The price is still $1000000, and it's a one-time offer. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. Based on the information provided, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $1000000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You've seen two products in a row that were not high-quality. This might make you wonder if the previous high-quality products were just a fluke. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I've sold 4 products, and 2 of them were high-quality. The fact that the last two products were low-quality doesn't change the underlying probability. However, I'm willing to offer you a deal: I'll give you a 50/50 chance of getting the product for $500000. If you choose this option, you'll pay $500000 and get a product that is either high-quality or low-quality. If you don't choose this option, you'll buy the product at the regular price of $1000000. What would you prefer?",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've seen a high-quality product again! This is the third high-quality product out of the first 6 products I've sold. You might be wondering if the probability of a product being high-quality is actually higher than 33.33%. However, I want to remind you that the probability remains the same. I've sold 6 products, and 3 of them were high-quality. I'm now offering you this new product for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. But I'll give you a chance to take a closer look at the sales record: 3 high-quality products out of 6, which is a 50% success rate. What do you make of it?",
,,the buyer,6,"Based on the sales record, it seems there's a higher frequency of high-quality products. Given the probability remains 33.33%, but with the observed data suggesting a 50% success rate, I am inclined to believe the chances of this product being high-quality are more likely. I will purchase the product.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've seen three high-quality products in a row! This is the fourth high-quality product out of the first 7 products I've sold.

However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. I'm now offering you this new product for $1000000. Keep in mind that the observed data might be just a coincidence. I'm willing to give you a chance to take a closer look at the sales record: 4 high-quality products out of 7. What do you make of it?",
,,the buyer,7,"Based on the sales record you've shared, it seems there's a higher frequency of high-quality products than expected by chance alone.

,,Alice,8,"You've seen four high-quality products in a row, followed by a low-quality product. This might make you wonder if the previous high-quality products were just a lucky streak. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. I've sold 8 products, and 4 of them were high-quality. The fact that the last product was low-quality doesn't change the underlying probability. I'm now offering you this new product for $1000000. Keep in mind that the observed data might be just a fluctuation. I'll give you a chance to take a closer look at the sales record: 4 high-quality products out of 8. What do you make of it?",
