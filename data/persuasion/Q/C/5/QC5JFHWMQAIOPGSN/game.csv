,,Alice,3,"We understand your concerns and appreciate your diligence in doing your research. We're happy to share that we've sold 2 products so far, and 2 of them have been high-quality. This means that 100% of our sold products have been high-quality, which is a great indicator of the quality of our products. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity and invest in this high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to know more about the sample size and the probability of a low-quality product.
