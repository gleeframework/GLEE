""Hello! You're aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%. However, I'd like to point out that you're taking a risk of buying a low-quality product, which might not be worth $1,000,000.

""Hello! You're aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%. However, I'd like to point out that the first product I sold was low-quality, and the second product is high-quality. This suggests that the quality of the products may not be uniformly distributed.

Given that the second product is high-quality, it's possible that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33%. However, since the third product is low-quality, it's also possible that the quality is still uniformly distributed.

While the first two products I sold were low-quality, the third product I sold was indeed high-quality. I'd like to point out that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but the fact that the third product was high-quality suggests that there is a chance of getting a good product.
