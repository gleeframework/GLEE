Alice's message: I see you're interested in understanding the process behind my product selection. I'd be happy to explain. I don't have any control over the quality of the products, but I do have a random selection process to determine which product to offer to each buyer. The quality of the product is determined by a random draw from a fixed distribution, and I don't have any influence over the outcome. I'm simply a middleman, presenting the products to the buyers.
