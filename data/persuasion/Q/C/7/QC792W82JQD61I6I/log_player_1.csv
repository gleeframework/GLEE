Now, regarding your question, the probability of all 4 high-quality products being sold consecutively is (0.8)^4 = 0.4096, or approximately 40.96%. This is a relatively low probability, and it's not surprising that you were able to catch on to it. However, I'd like to point out that this doesn't change the fact that the probability of a single product being high-quality is still 80%. I've now sold 5 products, with 5 of them being high-quality.
