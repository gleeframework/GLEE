Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you don't know my valuation, and I'm hoping that you're recommending based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Since 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 6, the proportion is 1/6. However, this is not the probability that the product is high quality, which is 33.33%. I'm hoping that you're making a mistake by recommending based on the proportion, and that the product is actually high quality. If it is, I'll get a good deal. If it's not, I'll just take a loss, but at least I'll have a chance to exploit your mistake.""}"
