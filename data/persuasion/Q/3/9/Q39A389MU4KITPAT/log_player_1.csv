"The buyer's message: I'll take my chances. Given the 50% probability of a high-quality product, and considering the value of a high-quality product to me is $3000000, I believe the potential reward outweighs the risk.

"The buyer's message: I understand that the streak of high-quality products may end at any time and that the probability of selling a high-quality product is still 50%.
