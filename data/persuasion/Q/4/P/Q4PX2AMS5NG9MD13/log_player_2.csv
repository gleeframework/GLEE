Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and I have sold a total of 1 product. I'm glad you're considering purchasing from me, but I want to be transparent with you. The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've already sold one high-quality product. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than 80%. I'm selling this product to you for $100, but I want to make it clear that the chances of getting a high-quality product are lower than they were in the first round.

Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products. I want to emphasize that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and the fact that the first two products were high-quality is just a coincidence. However, I do want to point out that I'm selling this product to you for $100, and if you buy it, you'll be getting a third high-quality product in a row. This is a 1 in 2^3 = 8 chance of happening, which is a bit more unlikely than the 80% chance of a single product being high-quality. I'm still confident that this product is worth $100 to you, and I think you should take the risk.
