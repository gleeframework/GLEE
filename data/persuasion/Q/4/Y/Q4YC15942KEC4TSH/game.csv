high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I think the probability of it being high-quality is lower than the previous buyer's experience suggests. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is 100%, but I believe this is likely due to sampling bias. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the limited data, it seems like the product is more likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a worthless product. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
