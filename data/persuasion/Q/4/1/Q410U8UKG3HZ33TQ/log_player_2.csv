**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:** Even though the product has a higher chance of being low quality (66.67%), the fact that Alice recommended it makes it more likely to be high quality. 
* **Previous data supports this:**  The previous buyer purchased a product and it was high quality. This indicates that Alice's recommendations may be reliable, even if they are not always accurate.
* **Potential gain outweighs potential loss:**  If the product is high quality, you gain $10,000. If it's low quality, you lose $10,000. The potential gain is significantly higher than the potential loss, and with Alice's recommendation, the odds of a high-quality product are likely increased.

**While there's still a chance the product is low quality, the information available makes buying the product a reasonable risk to take.**"
