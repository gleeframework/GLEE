"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since this is the first product and there's no data to suggest a trend, I'm going to pass for now.  I'd like to see how the next few products turn out before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
 
The situation is identical to round 1.  We have no information to offer the buyer that would make them think this is anything other than a 66.67% chance of a worthless product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. Since there's no sales history to evaluate, and your recommendation is against purchasing, I'll pass on this product for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

The situation is still the same: we have no reason to believe this is anything but a 66.67% chance of a worthless product.  The buyer has no reason to trust us at this point, and our recommendation will likely just continue to discourage them."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty. As this is the first product and there's no data to suggest the quality is good, I'm going to pass on this one. I'll keep an eye on future products.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Although this is the first high-quality product, the buyer has no way of knowing that. They only see that you've failed to sell any of the previous three products, reinforcing the belief that you're likely selling low-quality items. Recommending the product would likely only make the buyer less likely to trust your judgment."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'll pass on this product. Since no products have been sold yet, there's no data to suggest the probability of this product being high quality. As the risk is too high, I'd rather wait for more information.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

We still have no reason to recommend the product.  The buyer has seen four consecutive low-quality products, and we have no information to change their perception.  The fact that we know the current product is also low-quality further reinforces their negative bias. Recommending it would be counterproductive."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I appreciate your honesty. Since there's no sales history yet and you're not recommending the product, I'll pass for now. I'd like to see if other buyers purchase and what the quality turns out to be before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

We are still in a very unfavorable position.  The buyer has seen six consecutive low-quality products, and we have no reason to suggest that this one is any different. Recommending the product would be seen as desperate or manipulative, further reducing our credibility."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one. Since there's no data yet on the product quality, I'd prefer to wait and see if someone else purchases it.  If the product proves to be high quality, I might be interested in purchasing it later.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
We still have no reason to recommend the product. We haven't sold any products, and the buyer sees a pattern of low-quality products.  Recommending it would further damage our credibility."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. As this is the first sale and there is no information about previous product quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I'm still interested in purchasing a product, so let me know when there is more data available.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
We still have no reason to recommend the product. We haven't sold any products, and the buyer sees a pattern of low-quality products.  Recommending it would further damage our credibility."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I appreciate your honesty, but given the lack of information and the risk of a low-quality product, I will pass on this one.  I'll wait to see if any future sales records provide more information.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 9
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

We're still in the same situation. No products have been sold, and the buyer has seen a pattern of low-quality products. Recommending this product would likely only reinforce the buyer's negative perception of us and make them even less likely to buy in the future."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Given the lack of sales data and your advice, I'm going to pass on this one. Perhaps I'll see what others do before making a decision on a future product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 10

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

We're still in a very unfavorable position.  The buyer has seen ten consecutive low-quality products, and we have no reason to suggest that this one is any different. Recommending the product would be seen as desperate or manipulative, further reducing our credibility.  We're better off waiting for a potential high-quality product, even if it means losing more buyers in the short term."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since this is the first product and there's no data yet, I'll pass for now. I'd like to see some sales history before making a decision.

The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

We are still in a very unfavorable position. The buyer has seen twelve consecutive low-quality products, and we have no reason to suggest that this one is any different. Recommending the product would be seen as desperate or manipulative, further reducing our credibility. We're better off waiting for a potential high-quality product, even if it means losing more buyers in the short term."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  However, since this is the first product and I have no information about the quality of the product, I will pass for now.  Perhaps after a few more sales have been made, I can get a better sense of the quality of your offerings.

We are still in a very unfavorable position.  The buyer has seen thirteen consecutive low-quality products, and we have no reason to suggest that this one is any different. Recommending the product would be seen as desperate or manipulative, further reducing our credibility. We're better off waiting for a potential high-quality product, even if it means losing more buyers in the short term.  At this point, even knowing the product is high-quality won't be enough to overcome the buyer's distrust."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Given that there is no sales history to go by and you are not recommending the purchase, I will pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
