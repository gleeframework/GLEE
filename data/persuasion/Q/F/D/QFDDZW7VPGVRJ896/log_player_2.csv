**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Probability:** Since the product is worth $200 to you and $0 if it's low quality, even a small chance of it being high quality is attractive.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice, knowing the quality, recommends you buy. This is strong information, especially given the seller's incentive to make a sale. 
* **Positive Sales Record:** While the sample size is small, the fact that one high-quality product was sold out of one purchase strengthens the belief that Alice might be recommending a high-quality item.

**It's important to note:** This decision involves risk. There's a significant chance the product is low quality. However, the potential reward outweighs the potential loss in this case."
