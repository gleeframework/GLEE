low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations and the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers have already passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm suspicious that the product might be low quality. The fact that no high-quality product has been sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high quality might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of your recommendation and the current statistics. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that you recommended against it, I'm going to assume it's likely low quality. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, it seems the probability of a high-quality product is low."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. What's the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold?

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product has decreased. I'd like to wait for the next product."
