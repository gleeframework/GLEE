,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you know how much it's worth to me, and you're recommending it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that your recommendation might be biased. I'll take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sale."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyer's purchase, and I want to make an independent decision based on the statistics. I'd like to see the product quality before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I know that 1 out of 1 product was high-quality, but I think this might be a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next one to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold is higher."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,

,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a purchase.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold given the previous sales record. Can you provide that information?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, which may not be representative of the overall quality of the remaining products."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, there's only 1 high-quality product out of 1 sold, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 100%. However, considering the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'm suspicious that this might be a cherry-picked product. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 products, I'm not confident that the current product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product. Was it a high-quality product that influenced their decision, or was it just luck? I'd like to know the quality of the product they purchased."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation doesn't seem to be based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the second buyer. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 100%, which is much higher than the 80% chance I know the product is high-quality. This suggests that the sample size is too small, and I'm not confident in the accuracy of this recommendation. I'd rather wait for more data to become available before making a decision."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision. Was the product they purchased high-quality or low-quality?
