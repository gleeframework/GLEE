high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if I buy a low-quality product, I'll be out $10000 and there will be no chance to buy another product. Given the previous buyers have not found any high-quality products, I think it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is lower than 50%."
