,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase, especially since only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far. I'm not convinced that the product is worth the risk of being low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than Alice's recommendation suggests. I'm hoping to take advantage of the information that one high-quality product has been sold out of one product, which implies that the probability of a product being high quality is higher than 80%."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,

high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
