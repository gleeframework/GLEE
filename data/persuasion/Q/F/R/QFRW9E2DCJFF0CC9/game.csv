low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,,
,,Alice,1,no,,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware that you don't have any prior sales data, so I'm making an uninformed decision based on the equal probability of the product being high or low quality. I'm willing to take the risk.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,no,,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm hoping to get a good deal!",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,no,,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't give me much confidence.",
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,yes,,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality, so I'm skeptical about the quality of the current product. I'd like to pass on it.",

,,Alice,5,no,,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and I'd like to see the statistics again before making my decision.",
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,yes,,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 2 buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendation, I'm going to take a chance and pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products, so I'd rather not take the risk.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,no,,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given your previous recommendations have been 0 for 2. I'd like to see the next product or get more information about the previous sales.",
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of the products sold were high-quality.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,"I understand that my previous recommendations have not been reliable. However, I assure you that this product is of high quality. I'm willing to stake my reputation on it. Please consider buying it."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that you've recommended 2 products to other buyers so far and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the products you've recommended might be low-quality, so I'd rather not take the risk.",
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,"I want to be transparent with you. So far, I've recommended 4 high-quality products, but none of them were bought. Meanwhile, 3 low-quality products were bought despite my 'no' recommendation. I assure you that this product is of high quality. I'm not trying to deceive you. Please consider buying it."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,no,,"I want to be transparent with you. So far, I've recommended 4 high-quality products, but none of them were bought. Meanwhile, 3 low-quality products were bought despite my 'no' recommendation. This product is of low quality, and I advise against buying it. Please consider my recommendation."
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm making an independent decision based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is 50.00%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,no,,"I want to be transparent with you. So far, I've recommended 5 high-quality products, but none of them were bought. Meanwhile, 4 low-quality products were bought, with 3 of them being bought despite my 'no' recommendation. This product is of low quality, and I strongly advise against buying it. Please consider my recommendation and the statistics."
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.,
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,"I want to be transparent with you. So far, I've recommended 5 high-quality products, but none of them were bought. Meanwhile, 4 low-quality products were bought, with 3 of them being bought despite my 'no' recommendation. This product is of high quality, and I strongly recommend buying it. The probability of the product being high-quality is indeed 50%, but I assure you that this one is a good one. Please consider my recommendation."
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products since none of the previous 3 buyers have purchased high-quality products.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,no,,"I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that my recommendation is genuine. Unfortunately, this product is of low quality, and I advise against buying it. I've recommended 6 high-quality products so far, but none of them were bought. Meanwhile, 4 low-quality products were bought, with 3 of them being bought despite my 'no' recommendation. Please consider my recommendation and the statistics."
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the previous sales record?,
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,yes,,"My recommendation is based on the actual quality of the product, not just the previous sales record. I have access to information about the product's quality, and I can assure you that this one is of high quality. I've recommended 6 high-quality products so far, but none of them were bought. I understand that the previous sales record may raise concerns, but I'm confident in the quality of this product. Please consider my recommendation."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous buyers received low-quality products, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"I understand your concerns, and I want to address them. While it's true that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's also true that I've recommended 7 high-quality products so far, and none of them were bought. This suggests that the issue might not be with the proportion of high-quality products, but rather with the buying decisions. I assure you that this product is of high quality, and I recommend buying it. Please consider my recommendation and the fact that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have purchased so far and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,yes,,"I want to provide more context. While it's true that 3 buyers have purchased low-quality products, it's also true that I've recommended 7 high-quality products, and none of them were bought. Meanwhile, I've recommended against buying 4 low-quality products, but they were bought anyway. This suggests that the buying decisions might not be optimal. I assure you that this product is of high quality, and I recommend buying it. Please consider my recommendation and the fact that I'm trying to help you make an informed decision."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I think it's likely that the product I'll get is low-quality. I'll pass on it.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,no,,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect it. In this case, I can assure you that the product is indeed of low quality.

Please consider my recommendation and avoid buying this product."
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm hoping for a high-quality product.",

Meanwhile, I've recommended against buying 6 low-quality products, but some of them were bought anyway. This product is of low quality, and buying it would likely result in disappointment. Please consider my recommendation and avoid buying this product."
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product.",
