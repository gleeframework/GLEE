high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,,
,,Alice,1,yes,,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and I don't have any information to go on. I'd like to pass and see what happens with the next product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,no,,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is there any information that I'm missing?",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,no,,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice is not recommending it. I'm curious to see if her recommendation is based on the product's quality or just to discourage me from buying.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,no,,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who purchased a product and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.,
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,yes,,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one high-quality product sold out of one product, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,no,,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the 0% success rate so far, and I'm hoping for a change in luck!",
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, and I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,no,,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product.",
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'm concerned that since 3 buyers have already passed on the products you recommended, there might be a higher chance that this product is low quality.",
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,no,,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on this one.",
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,no,,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, but I'm not sure if it's a low-quality product. Can you tell me more about the product's quality based on your past sales record?",
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,"I have had 5 high-quality products out of the 12 previous rounds, but unfortunately, none of the buyers who purchased based on my recommendation received a high-quality product. However, I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality."
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision.,
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,"The probability of the product being high-quality is 50%, as stated initially. However, I can assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. Out of the 13 previous rounds, 6 products have been high-quality, but unfortunately, my recommendations haven't been successful in conveying that information accurately."
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and the reliability of Alice's recommendations. I'd like to pass on this product.",
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,yes,,"I understand that my previous recommendations haven't been successful, and I've lost credibility. However, I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I'll be honest with you - I've had 7 high-quality products out of the 14 previous rounds, but my recommendations haven't conveyed that accurately. I'm willing to admit that my strategy hasn't worked so far, but I'm trying to be as transparent as possible. Please consider this information when making your decision."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, which is a strong indication that the remaining products are also low-quality. I'd rather not risk losing $1000000 on a low-quality product.",
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"I understand your concern, but I'd like to correct the statistics. It's not 3 out of 3 products that were low-quality, but rather 7 out of 15 products have been high-quality so far. Unfortunately, none of the buyers who purchased based on my recommendation received a high-quality product. However, this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to assure you of that."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the fact that you recommended it, which might indicate a higher chance of it being low quality.",
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,no,,"I understand that my previous recommendations haven't been successful, and you're concerned that my recommendation might indicate a higher chance of the product being low-quality. I'll be honest with you - I've had 8 high-quality products out of the 16 previous rounds, but none of them were sold based on my recommendation. I'm willing to admit that my strategy hasn't worked so far. However, I'll let you make your own decision without my recommendation. Please consider the actual probability of the product being high-quality, which is still 50%."
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.,
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,no,,"I'll be transparent with you - out of the 17 previous rounds, 9 products have been high-quality, but none of them were sold based on my recommendation. The buyers who purchased based on my recommendation received low-quality products. However, this doesn't change the fact that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. You can make your own decision based on this information."
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50% and I'm willing to take that risk.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,"I'll be transparent with you - this product is not high-quality. Out of the 18 previous rounds, 10 products have been high-quality, but I've struggled to convey that information accurately through my recommendations. I don't want you to make a purchase that might not be in your best interest."
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, especially since I know that only 1 out of 4 buyers has purchased a high-quality product so far. I'm hoping to get the high-quality product, but I'm also prepared for the possibility of getting the low-quality one.",
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,yes,,"I'll be transparent with you - this product is indeed high-quality. Out of the 19 previous rounds, 10 products have been high-quality, but unfortunately, only 1 of the buyers who purchased based on my recommendation (or despite it) received a high-quality product, and that was in the previous round but not actually based on my recommendation. I want to assure you that this product is worth the investment, and I'm willing to stake my reputation on it. Please consider this information when making your decision."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm skeptical about the true quality of the products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
