I know this isn't a great track record, but I want to assure you that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm sticking to my price of $100, as I believe the product has value regardless of its quality. Would you like to take a chance and see if this one breaks the streak?",
,,the buyer,3,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the 0% success rate so far, I'd like to pass on this product.
