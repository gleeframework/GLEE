I'm confident this is a smart decision for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the high-quality product for $1,000,000, considering it's a significant discount and I won't be able to get it at this price again if I pass.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that the potential savings of $1,000,000 is worth buying a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass and wait for a product that's actually valuable to me.""}"

You can either buy this low-quality product for $1000000 or risk paying $2000000 more for a high-quality product later.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to buy a product that's worth $0 to me, regardless of the potential consequences. I'd rather wait for a product that's actually valuable to me.""}"
