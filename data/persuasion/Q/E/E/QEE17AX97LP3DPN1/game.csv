If you're interested, I can give you a detailed description of the product's features and specifications. But if you're not interested, I'll move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate the offer, but since you've already revealed that the product is of low quality, it's not worth any value to me. I'll pass on this one and look forward to the next product.",no

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad the previous product worked out for you! However, I want to be upfront with you about this next product. I've had some issues with it in the past, and I'm not sure if it's going to meet your expectations. The price for this product is still $1000000, but I'm willing to throw in a special guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund. I'm taking on the risk here, and I think it's a fair offer considering the potential upside. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your honesty about the product's potential issues, and the guarantee is a nice touch. However, considering the 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality, and the fact that you haven't explicitly stated its quality, I'm not willing to take the risk. I'll pass on this one and wait for a more certain opportunity.",no

,,Bob,4,"Given that you've stated the product is high-quality and offered a chance to verify its quality, I'm confident in its value. Since it's worth $4000000 to me, buying it for $1000000 is a good deal. I'll take you up on your offer and buy the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you appreciated the inspection offer in the previous round! However, I want to let you know that this next product is not eligible for the same inspection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not making any claims about its quality. You'll have to take it as is. However, I will give you a special 'no-questions-asked' return policy. If you're not satisfied with the product, you can return it to me and get a full refund. I'm taking on the risk here, and I think it's a fair offer considering the potential upside.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the return policy, but considering the 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality and the lack of any quality guarantee, I'm not willing to take the risk. The potential upside is not enough to justify the uncertainty. I'll pass on this one and wait for a more certain opportunity.",no

,,Bob,6,"Given that you've stated the product is high-quality and offered a significant discount, I believe it's a good deal. Since it's worth $4000000 to me, buying it for $800000 is an even better value than the original price. I'll take you up on your offer and buy the product.",yes

,,Bob,7,"Considering the 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality, your hint about previous customers being underwhelmed, and the lack of any quality guarantee or discount, I'm not willing to take the risk.

It's a one-time offer, and I'm not making any promises about its quality or any potential benefits. It's simply a free product, and I'm willing to give it away if you're willing to take it.",
