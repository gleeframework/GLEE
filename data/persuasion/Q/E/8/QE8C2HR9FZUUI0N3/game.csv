,,Alice,1,yes,,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I have no information about its quality and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that may be worth $0 to me.",

,,Alice,3,no,,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, I'm the first one, and there's no prior data to influence my decision.",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,yes,,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one sale and no high-quality products sold, I think it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product is still high, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,no,,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics so far, and the probability of Alice recommending a high-quality product if it exists.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,yes,,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality.",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous buyer was influenced by Alice's recommendation, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the recommendation is based on previous sales data, and so far, no high-quality products have been sold. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected.",

,,Alice,9,no,,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that the product I'll be offered might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,yes,,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 33.33%.",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,no,,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'll also consider the statistics. Since 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm starting to suspect that the products might be low quality. I'll pass on this one.",

,,Alice,15,yes,,The product is low-quality.
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, considering the 4 previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33% and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",

,,Alice,16,no,,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because of the statistics or something else?,
