Based on the statistics, it seems that all the previous 5 products sold were low-quality, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than 33.33%.

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have received a recommendation from you and none of them were high-quality products, it's likely that you have a bias towards recommending low-quality products.
