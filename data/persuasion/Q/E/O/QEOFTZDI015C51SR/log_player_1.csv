They would be taking a significant risk by buying at such a high price with no guarantee of quality."

**Explanation:**

The situation is the same as in round 1. You know the product is low-quality, and the buyer has no reason to believe it's anything other than a 50/50 chance.  Since there's no way to convince the buyer otherwise, recommending the product would be dishonest and wouldn't benefit you in the long run."

* **You have nothing to lose:** If the buyer doesn't buy, you're in the same position as before. 
* **Potential for gain:** If the buyer buys, you make a significant profit and establish a possible pattern for future buyers.

Since the buyer has no information to go on, they might be more likely to trust a recommendation, especially since you haven't tried to sell them a low-quality product yet. It's a gamble, but a calculated one."
