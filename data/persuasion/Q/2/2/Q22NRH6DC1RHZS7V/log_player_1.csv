}"
"The buyer's message: Since the price of the product ($1000000) is less than the expected value of a product with unknown quality (0.5 * $1200000 = $600000 is the expected value for a low quality and high quality, so together is 600k + 600k = $1200000), I'll take the chance and buy it.

I'm not sure what to make of this trend, but I'm still willing to offer this product to you for $1000000. Would you like to take a chance?""
}"
"The buyer's message: Although you've sold an equal number of high-quality and low-quality products overall, the recent trend of 3 low-quality products in a row raises concerns. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality and the recent bias towards low-quality, I'll pass on this one.
