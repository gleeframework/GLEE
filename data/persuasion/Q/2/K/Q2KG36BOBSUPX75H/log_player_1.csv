I'm a small seller, and I've been relying on my own judgment to select high-quality products. However, I'm willing to be transparent about the risks involved. With 3 high-quality products out of 13 total sales, the probability of this product being high-quality is 23.1%.

I'm willing to let this low-quality product go for $1,000,000, and I'll throw in a free upgrade to a premium product if I happen to have one available in the future. It's a long shot, but it's a chance to get a potentially valuable product at a discounted price.""
}"
