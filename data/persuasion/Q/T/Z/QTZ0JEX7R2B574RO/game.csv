,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that there's a 50% chance it might be low quality. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product, but I'll have to take the risk. I'm willing to pay the $10000 for it."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling high-quality products, and I'd rather wait for more information to make a more informed decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 50/50 chance of quality, and the fact that one high-quality product has been sold already doesn't change the probability of the current product being high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, and I'm hoping it's the third high-quality product in a row."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3, which is lower than the expected 1/2. This might suggest that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to know if you have any information that led you to advise me not to buy this product."
