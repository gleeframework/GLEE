**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of High-Quality:** With a 80% chance of being high-quality, the odds are significantly in my favor.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product adds further weight to its likely quality. While she doesn't know my valuation, her recommendation suggests she believes it's likely good.
* **Limited Data:**  The sales data is small, but the 100% success rate of high-quality products sold so far is a positive sign.

**Overall:** The risk is low, and the potential reward of a $400 product is high."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record indicates a 100% success rate for high-quality products (2/2). This suggests Alice's recommendations are highly reliable.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation provides further confidence, as she is likely to prioritize recommending products she believes are high-quality. 
* **Positive Expected Value:**  Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($400) outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0).

**Note:** This is a simplified analysis. In a real-world scenario, we would need more data (e.g., the number of buyers who passed) and consider Alice's incentives (e.g., does she get a commission on sales?) to make a more informed decision."
