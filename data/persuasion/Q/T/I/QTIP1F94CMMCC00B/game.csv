In fact, I can tell you that the first product sold was a low-quality product, and the second was also a low-quality product. The third product, which was sold to the buyer who purchased from us earlier, was a high-quality product. The buyer who purchased that product was thrilled with their purchase and has been a loyal customer. As for the other two products, the buyers who purchased them were looking for a specific feature that we didn't have in our high-quality products, so they opted for the lower-quality option.

To be honest, it was a bit of a fluke - we had a new batch of products come in, and this one happened to be a high-quality one. As for the price, I can see where you're coming from, but I'm afraid $10000 is the lowest price we can offer for this product. However, I can offer you a special deal on this low-quality product.
