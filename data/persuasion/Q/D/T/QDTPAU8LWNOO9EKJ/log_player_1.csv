{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Bob has explicitly stated he is not buying any more products from you. He has lost all trust in your recommendations, even though this product is high-quality.  You need a significant strategy shift to regain his trust. You might consider:

* **Transparency:**  Reveal the true distribution of high-quality and low-quality products.
* **Proof:** Offer a way for Bob to verify the quality of the product before purchase.
* **Discount:**  Offer a substantial discount on a product, perhaps on a product that you can guarantee is high-quality.
