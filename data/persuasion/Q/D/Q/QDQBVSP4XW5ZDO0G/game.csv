,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. If you buy it, you'll get a great deal, but if you don't, I'll just have to sell it to someone else who will probably pay the same price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, I'll pass for now.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're hesitant, but I want to make it clear that this product is not as good as the one I showed you last round. It's a bit of a compromise, but I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100. If you're willing to take a chance, you might be able to flip it for a profit later or use it for a different purpose. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that this product is a good value for me, I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand you're still hesitant, but I want to be upfront with you - this product is not a great value, and I'm willing to let it go for $90.

If you're not interested, I'll just have to sell it to someone else for a lower price.",

I'm willing to sell it to you for $80, and I'll even throw in a small bonus - I'll give you a 10% refund if you return it to me within a week. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value.",
