"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a rare opportunity to get a product at a discounted price! I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, which is 10% off the market value. It's a one-time offer, so you should take advantage of it!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""While the 100% satisfaction guarantee sounds appealing, I'm still not convinced. The guarantee doesn't change the fact that there's a 50% chance the product is low-quality, and I'd be out $1000000.
