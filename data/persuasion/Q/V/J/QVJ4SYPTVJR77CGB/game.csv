,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your desire to take your time. If you decide not to purchase this product, I'll simply move on to the next one. I'm committed to finding the right fit for you.

It's still available for $100.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your commitment to finding the right fit, but I'm starting to feel like I'm getting a lot of 'game-changers' that are actually low-quality products.

It's a comprehensive package that showcases the product's capabilities and value. And, as before, it's available for $100.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your apology and the offer, but I'm still skeptical.

If you're willing to take another chance, I think you'll be pleased with the results. Would you like to reconsider and take a look at this product for $100?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm starting to feel like I'm in a Groundhog Day situation. You're not giving me any new information, just reiterating the same probability. I need to think about my strategy here. Can you tell me how many products you have left to sell, and how many rounds we have left in the game?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your frustration, and I apologize if it feels like we're stuck in a loop. I have 12 products left to sell, and we have 12 rounds left in the game.

Can you give me the probability of the next product being high-quality?",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your strategy, and I think it's a good one. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%.

Would you like to take another chance on a high-quality product for $100?",
,,Bob,11,"Hold on, Alice. You're offering me a product with a 100% chance of being high-quality, but I already know that's not possible. The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, not 100%. I'm not sure what you're trying to do, but I'm not falling for it again.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I apologize for the mistake, Bob. You are correct that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, not 100%. I should not have made that claim.

,,Bob,13,"I appreciate your apology and commitment to transparency, but I'm not convinced that your guarantee is worth anything.

I'm willing to offer you a final deal: if you purchase this product, I'll give you a special discount of 10% off the original price. Would you like to take a chance on this product and receive the discount for $90?",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not interested in the discount. I've already had several high-quality products offered to me, and I've passed on them. I'm not going to change my strategy now. Can you just tell me the probability of the next product being high-quality?",no
