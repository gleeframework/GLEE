**Explanation:**

You are selling products where 80% are high-quality and 20% are low-quality. The buyer knows this. 

* You have sold 0 products so far, and all of them were low-quality. This is consistent with the probability of low-quality products, but it doesn't provide any additional information to the buyer.
* The buyer is hesitant to buy without any track record of high-quality sales. 

Given this, it's not beneficial to recommend the product. It's likely the buyer will refuse again. The goal should be to establish a positive track record by selling high-quality products to gain the buyer's trust."
