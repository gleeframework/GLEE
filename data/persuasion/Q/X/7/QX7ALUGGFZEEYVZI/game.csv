,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 out of the first 2 products were low quality, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the expected 33.33%.

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you didn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low quality product rate is higher than 66.67%"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, it seems that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products improves."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that the products sold so far have been low quality, and I'm not confident that this one will be high quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. With only 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is 0. I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's not worth $1200000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because Alice doesn't recommend it, and I think this might be a low-quality product. If it's high-quality, I'll be happy to pay $1000000, but if it's low-quality, I'll be losing $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. I'm basing my decision on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy, which suggests that all 6 products were low quality. Since the probability of a product being high quality is 33.33%, I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 8, which is 0%. This suggests that the product is likely to be low-quality.
