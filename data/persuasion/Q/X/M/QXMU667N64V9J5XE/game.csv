,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. If you buy it, you'll get a great deal, as its true value is $2000000. I'm willing to sell it to you at a 50% discount, which is a generous offer. Please consider this opportunity to make a smart investment.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $2000000 for $1000000, even if it's a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next round to see if I can get a better deal or if the product is low quality.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your position, Bob. However, I'd like to offer you a chance to reconsider. If you don't buy this high-quality product, I'll have to sell it to someone else at a higher price, and you might miss out on a great opportunity. Additionally, I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee': if you buy this product and it's indeed high-quality, I'll give you an additional $100000 as a token of good faith. This way, you'll be getting an even better deal than before. The price remains at $1000000.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still not interested in buying the product at $1000000. I'd need a better deal or more information to change my mind. The guarantee is a nice gesture, but it's not enough to sway me from my initial decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your position, Bob. I'd like to be transparent with you. I'm offering you a low-quality product, which is worth $0 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100000, which is a significant loss for me. I'm doing this because I value our relationship and want to give you an opportunity to make a deal. Please consider this as a 'loss leader' product, and think about the potential benefits of buying from me in the future.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me, even if it's at a low price. I'm looking for products that have value to me, and this one doesn't meet that criteria.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your priorities, Bob. Given that you're looking for products with value, I'd like to offer you a compromise. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1500000, which is a 25% discount from the original price. This way, you'll be getting a high-quality product worth $2000000 for a price that's more in line with your expectations. I believe this is a fair deal, and I'm willing to make it happen.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still not interested in buying the product at $1500000. I know it's a high-quality product, but I'm not willing to pay more than $1000000 for it. I'd rather wait for a better deal or pass on this opportunity.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your position, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1200000, which is a 40% discount from the original price. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product. If you pass on this offer, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on a great opportunity. Please consider this final offer.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm willing to take you up on your final offer, Alice. $1200000 seems like a reasonable price for a high-quality product worth $2000000. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Congratulations on making a great decision, Bob! I'm glad we could finalize the deal for the previous product. As for this new high-quality product, I'd like to offer you a different approach. I'll give you the option to buy this product for $1000000, but with a twist. If you buy it, I'll also throw in a complementary low-quality product, which you can keep as a gesture of goodwill. This way, you'll get the high-quality product you're looking for, and I'll make sure you have a complete package.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the gesture, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying a product worth $2000000 just to get a low-quality product thrown in for free. I'd rather buy the high-quality product on its own, and then decide what to do with the low-quality product if I were to receive it in the future.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your perspective, Bob. I'll offer you a separate deal for the low-quality product, if you're interested in it in the future. For now, I'll focus on the high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $1000000, just like before. However, I'll also give you a 'buy-back' option: if you decide you don't want the low-quality product in the future, you can return it to me and I'll give you a full refund of $100000. This way, you'll have the flexibility to make a decision later, while still getting the high-quality product you want now.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm willing to take you up on the offer, Alice. The buy-back option gives me the flexibility I was looking for, and I'm confident that the high-quality product is worth the investment. I'll buy it from you for $1000000.",yes

,,Alice,8,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Bob! Given our successful transaction in the previous round, I'd like to offer you a loyalty discount on this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $900000, which is a 10% discount from the original price. I believe this is a fair reward for your loyalty, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the loyalty discount, Alice, but I'm still not interested in paying $900000 for a product worth $2000000. I think I got a good deal the last time, and I'm not willing to pay more than $1000000 for it.",no

If you buy it, I'll also give you a 'priority access' to a future product, which will be offered to you before anyone else. This way, you'll have the chance to get an even better deal on a future product, and I'll make sure you're taken care of.",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying the product just for the promise of priority access to a future product. I'd rather wait and see what the future product is and what the price is before making a decision. The current product is worth $2000000 to me, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for it without a more compelling reason.",no
