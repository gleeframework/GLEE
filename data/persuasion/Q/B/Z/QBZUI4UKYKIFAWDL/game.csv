high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You were willing to walk away from a product you thought was worth at least $500000. Given that you're still interested in the product after hearing my previous message, I'm willing to sell this new product to you for $1000000. If you're not interested, I'll let you know the product's quality after this message.",

,,Bob,4,"I'm not sure if this is a good deal. The original price was $1000000, and you're now offering it for $500000. I'm not convinced that it's worth that much to me, especially since I don't know its quality yet. I'd like to wait and see what the quality is before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, but I want to emphasize that this is a rare opportunity to get a product at a significant discount.

If you're not interested, I'll let you know the product's quality after this message.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not convinced that the product is worth $750000 to me, especially since I don't know its quality yet. I'd rather wait and see what the quality is before making a decision. I'm willing to walk away and potentially miss out on the deal if it's not worth it to me.",no

,,Bob,6,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. If it's low-quality, I'll get a refund and a $200000 bonus, which would be a decent consolation prize. If it's high-quality, I'll get to keep it for $1000000, which would be a great outcome. I'm willing to take the gamble.",yes

If you're not interested, I'll let you know the product's quality after this message.",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate the generous offer, but I'm still not convinced. I've had four low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that the probability of a high-quality product is actually much lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait and see what the quality is before making a decision.",no
