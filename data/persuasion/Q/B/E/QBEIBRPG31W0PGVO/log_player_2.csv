I'm willing to provide a 100% satisfaction guarantee, but I must inform you that the product's value is uncertain.

This time, I'll provide you with a simple, low-risk proposition: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% refund if you decide to return it within the next 24 hours.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still hesitant to buy without knowing the product's quality. The refund offer is tempting, but I'm not willing to take the risk without knowing if the product is high-quality or not.""}"

Nevertheless, I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this product at a discounted price of $800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll find the product's features and specifications compelling. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the transparency, but I'm still not willing to take the risk without knowing the product's quality. The discounted price is attractive, but I'd rather wait for a chance to get a high-quality product.""}"
