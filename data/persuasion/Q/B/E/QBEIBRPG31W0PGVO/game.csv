,,Alice,1,"I'd like to offer you a product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a potentially valuable item. I'm willing to provide a 100% satisfaction guarantee, but I must inform you that the product's value is uncertain. If you're willing to take the risk, you could potentially gain a significant return on investment. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'd like to decline the offer. I'm not willing to take the risk without knowing the product's quality.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to be cautious. However, I'd like to offer you a second chance to acquire a product at the same price of $1000000. This time, I'll provide you with a simple, low-risk proposition: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% refund if you decide to return it within the next 24 hours. This way, you'll have a chance to try out the product and see if it's worth keeping, with minimal financial risk. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm still hesitant to buy without knowing the product's quality. The refund offer is tempting, but I'm not willing to take the risk without knowing if the product is high-quality or not.",no

,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your concerns, Bob. I want to make a more transparent offer. I'll give you a detailed breakdown of the product's features and specifications, which you can review at your leisure. However, I must inform you that the product's quality is still uncertain, and there's a 66.67% chance it may not meet your expectations. Nevertheless, I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this product at a discounted price of $800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll find the product's features and specifications compelling. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the transparency, but I'm still not willing to take the risk without knowing the product's quality. The discounted price is attractive, but I'd rather wait for a chance to get a high-quality product.",no

This way, you'll have a chance to acquire a high-quality product without having to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality one. What do you say?",
