,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase a product for $10000. I'm confident you'll love it, but I want to be transparent with you - I've had some issues with this particular batch, and I'm not sure if it's the best quality. However, I'm willing to take that risk with you, and I think it's a fair price considering the potential benefits. What do you say?",

,,Alice,2,"I appreciate your caution in the previous round, and I'm glad you're being careful with your investments. However, I'd like to offer you this next product with a higher level of confidence. I've personally inspected it, and I can assure you that it's one of the best in the batch. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000, but I think you'll find it's a great value considering its quality and potential benefits. Would you like to take a closer look?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by your assurance, I'll pass on this one too.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision to be cautious. However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is not one of the best in the batch. I'm not trying to mislead you, and I'm willing to be transparent about its quality. Considering the price of $10000, I'm essentially giving it away. If you're looking to take a risk and potentially get a great deal, this might be an opportunity for you. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take a chance on this one, but I'm only doing it because the price is low and I think the potential reward is worth the risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product and I appreciate your willingness to consider this one as well. However, I want to be clear that this product is not an improvement over the last one. In fact, it's one of the weaker ones in the batch. I'm still offering it to you for $10000, but I want to make sure you understand that the value is even lower than before. If you're looking to take another risk, I'm willing to let you have it, but I'm not expecting you to be as optimistic about this one as you were with the last one.",
,,Bob,4,"I don't think I'm getting a good deal here, and I'm not willing to take another risk on a low-quality product.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your decision to pass on the last one, and I respect your caution. Now, I'd like to offer you a product that I'm extremely confident in. I've checked and double-checked its quality, and I can assure you that it's one of the best in the batch. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000, but I think you'll find it's a great value considering its quality and potential benefits. I'm willing to give you a personal guarantee that this product is worth at least $12500 to you, and I'm willing to provide a special 'quality assurance' certificate to prove it. Would you like to take a closer look?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the guarantee and the certificate, but I'm still skeptical. I've been burned before, and I'm not convinced by your assurances. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your caution. However, I want to be transparent with you - I'm willing to make a concession on the price for this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Considering the low quality of this product, I think this is a fair price, and I'm essentially giving it away. If you're looking to take a risk and get a good deal, this might be an opportunity for you.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm still not convinced by the low price, and I'm not sure if the product is really worth $8000 to me, let alone the original price of $10000. I'll pass on this one.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I completely understand your concerns about costs, and I respect your decision to pass on this offer. However, I want to be upfront with you - I'm running a promotion for the next few products, and I'm willing to offer you a 'last chance' deal on this one. I'll sell it to you for $5000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Considering the low quality of this product, I'm essentially giving it away. If you're looking to take a risk and get an extremely good deal, this might be your last opportunity.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not falling for the 'last chance' deal, Alice. I know the product is low-quality and not worth $5000 to me. I'll pass on this one.",no

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand that you're not convinced, and I respect your decision to pass on the previous offer. However, I want to be honest with you - this is one of the last high-quality products I have in stock, and I'm willing to sell it to you at a price that's lower than the original $10000. I'll sell it to you for $9500, and I'm willing to throw in a 5-year warranty on the product. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the quality of the product and the warranty. What do you think?",

At this point, I'm not even sure why I'm bothering to offer you this product. I'll sell it to you for $10000, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - it's a low-quality product, and you'll probably be disappointed.
