Alice's message: Welcome! I'm offering this product for $10000. I understand that previous buyers were hesitant due to the lack of sales history.

Although I'm not in a position to offer discounts or guarantees, I'm willing to share that the first two products didn't meet the buyers' expectations. However, I'm eager to turn that around and start building a positive sales history. If you're willing to take a chance, I'm confident that future products will reflect the quality I strive to provide.

However, given the lack of a positive sales history and the high price, I'm going to pass on this one.
