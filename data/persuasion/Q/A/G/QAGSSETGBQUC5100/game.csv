,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the current data. Given that 1 out of 1 buyer passed on the product and 0 high-quality products were sold, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
