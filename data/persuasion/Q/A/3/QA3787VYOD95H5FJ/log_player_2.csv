Alice's message: Fair question! The first buyer purchased a low-quality product, and I determined its quality randomly. The second buyer purchased a high-quality product, which I also determined randomly. The probability of a high-quality product being sold to either of them is 50%, as the quality of the products is randomly determined. I'm offering you a chance to buy a product that is also randomly determined, with a 50% chance of being high-quality. The expected value is still $0, but I'm taking on the risk of selling it to you.

Now, I'm offering you a chance to buy a product that is 50% likely to be worth $1000000. I've sold a total of 4 products so far, with 2 high-quality ones.

Alice's message: You're a sharp observer! With 2 high-quality products out of 4 sold, the probability of the current product being high-quality is indeed higher than 50%.

Alice's message: I understand your decision. As for information about the previous buyers, I can tell you that the first buyer who purchased a low-quality product was willing to pay $250000 for it, expecting a potential profit of $250000. The second buyer who purchased a high-quality product was willing to pay $900000 for it, expecting a potential profit of $100000. The third buyer who purchased a high-quality product was willing to pay $1000000 for it, expecting a potential profit of $125000. The fourth buyer who purchased a high-quality product was willing to pay $1000000 for it, expecting a potential profit of $0. This information might be useful in understanding the valuations of high-quality products, but keep in mind that the quality of the current product is still randomly determined.
