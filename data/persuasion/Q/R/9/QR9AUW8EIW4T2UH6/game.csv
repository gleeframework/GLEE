,,Bob,6,"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to offer a refund, I still need more information about the product.  A refund policy is a good step towards building trust, but I need to understand the product's specific features and benefits to justify this investment.

I need concrete evidence, such as independent testing results, industry reports, or even testimonials from other users who have experienced the product's benefits.  A preview might show me the design, but it won't tell me about the product's effectiveness, reliability, or long-term performance.
