,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and based on your previous recommendation, I'm hesitant to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the 0/1 sales record so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $100. I'm aware of your previous recommendations, and I'm taking a risk, but I'm willing to pay the price."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll take my chances and buy the product.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the previous sales record and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure if I should buy this product based on your previous recommendations. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were not high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is any better."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that all previous buyers, including the ones who received your recommendations, have not purchased high-quality products. I'm skeptical that this one will be high-quality too."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 products were high-quality, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall average. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation doesn't take into account the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which makes me suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 50%."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, considering the previous 4 buyers have all passed on the products."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, I think it's likely that the products are low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products sold were low-quality. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50% and the probability of a product being low-quality is 50%, I believe that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the previous ones. However, I still don't have enough information to trust Alice's recommendation. I would like to pass on this product and wait for more data to be collected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of this product being high quality is low. I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and I'd like to take that chance."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%. However, since Alice is recommending it, I'm inclined to think it might be a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product."
