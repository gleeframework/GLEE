Don't let the sales record fool you - take a chance and reap the benefits of a high-quality product.""}"

The fact that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't end up buying suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality.

The streak of not buying high-quality products has been broken, and I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations. Buy it and take advantage of the momentum!""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product is 1/3, which is not high enough for me to take the risk. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.
