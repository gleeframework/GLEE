high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,,
,,Alice,1,yes,,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,yes,,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,yes,,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to wait and see what happens with the next product.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,yes,,"I have recommended buying the previous three products, and although none were purchased, I assure you that this product is also of high quality. The probability of four consecutive high-quality products is low, but I assure you this one is worth the investment."
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see the outcome of this product's quality before making a decision.,
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,yes,,"I'll be transparent with you. The previous four products were all high-quality, and I recommended buying them. Although none were purchased, I want to assure you that this product is also of high quality. Consider this: if you buy this product and it's indeed high-quality, you'll gain valuable information for future purchases. If you don't buy it, you'll never know what could have been. Take a chance and buy this product to potentially gain an advantage in future rounds."
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,no,,"I want to build trust with you. Although I've recommended buying the previous five products, I must inform you that this product does not meet the high standards of the previous ones. I advise against buying this product."
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,no,,"I want to maintain transparency with you. This product does not meet the high standards I strive for. In the previous round, I advised against buying a product, and the buyer took the risk anyway. I'm telling you now that this product is also not worth the investment. Please consider this information when making your decision."
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.,
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,"Considering my previous recommendations and the outcome of the sales, 5 out of 6 high-quality products were not bought, and 1 low-quality product was bought despite my warning. This round's product is of high quality, and I recommend buying it. Keep in mind that the initial probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, but given my track record of honesty, you might reassess the probability of this product being high-quality."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous buyer didn't buy it and the statistics show 0 high-quality products sold so far. This suggests that the products might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,"I understand the previous buyer's concern, but I assure you that the statistics are misleading. Although no high-quality products have been sold, it's because buyers have been cautious, not because the products are low-quality. In fact, 6 out of the 8 previous products were high-quality, and I've been honest about the quality of the products. This round's product is also high-quality, and I recommend buying it. Don't let the sales record fool you - take a chance and reap the benefits of a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that Alice recommended it. Since the previous buyer also passed on the product, and there was no sale, it's possible that all products are low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the statistics change.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,no,,"I've been honest about the quality of the products so far, and I'll continue to do so. This round's product does not meet the high standards I strive for, and I advise against buying it. Don't let the previous buyers' skepticism cloud your judgment - trust my recommendation and wait for a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you didn't recommend it. This suggests that the product may be low quality, and I'm hoping to get a good deal.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,no,,"I strongly advise against buying this product. Not only is it low-quality, but the previous buyer's strategy of buying a product because I didn't recommend it has been proven flawed. Don't make the same mistake - wait for a high-quality product that I can confidently recommend."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Is it 0%?",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,no,,"Unfortunately, yes, the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0%. Despite my recommendations, no high-quality products have been purchased. And I must inform you that this round's product is also low-quality. I advise against buying it and instead waiting for a high-quality product that I can confidently recommend."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'm not confident in the product's quality based on your previous recommendations.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,"I understand the previous buyer's skepticism, but I assure you that this product is different. It's a high-quality product, and I'm confident in its value. Don't let the previous sales record discourage you - I've been honest about the quality of the products, and this one is worth the investment. Take a chance and break the streak of not buying high-quality products."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. The fact that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't end up buying suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, I'd like to wait for a recommendation to buy, which would indicate a higher likelihood of a high-quality product.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,no,,"I'm going to go against my usual approach and advise against buying this product. Not because it's low-quality, but because I want to see if you'll take the opposite approach of the previous buyer. This product is actually high-quality, but I'm not recommending it. Will you take the chance and buy it anyway?"
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,yes,,"Finally, a high-quality product was sold in the previous round! I'm glad the buyer took the chance. And now, I'm happy to recommend this round's product, which is also high-quality. The streak of not buying high-quality products has been broken, and I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations. Buy it and take advantage of the momentum!"
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product is 1/3, which is not high enough for me to take the risk. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"I understand the previous buyer's concern about the probability, but I'd like to correct the assumption. The fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold doesn't mean the probability of a high-quality product is 1/3. The actual probability is still 50%, and I've been honest about the quality of the products. This round's product is also high-quality, and I recommend buying it. Don't let the sales record mislead you - take a chance and get a great product."
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision.,
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,yes,,"I'd be happy to provide more information about the previous sales. Out of 16 rounds, 10 products were high-quality, and I recommended buying most of them. However, only 1 high-quality product was actually sold, and it was in a round where I didn't recommend buying it. This round's product is also high-quality, and I recommend buying it. I've been transparent about the quality of the products, and I'm confident that this one will meet your expectations."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,yes,,"I've been recommending high-quality products for several rounds now, and I'm starting to think that my recommendations are actually deterring buyers. I want to assure you that this product is genuinely high-quality, and I'm not just saying that to make a sale. I've been transparent about the quality of the products throughout this process, and I'm confident that this one will meet your expectations. Please consider buying it."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 1/3, which is lower than the 50% chance of a product being high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,"I understand the previous buyer's concern, but I want to correct their assumption again. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, not 1/3. However, I must inform you that this round's product is actually low-quality. I'm being transparent about it, and I advise against buying it. Don't take the risk - wait for a high-quality product that I can confidently recommend."
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you tell me more about the products that were sold to the previous buyers?,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,no,,"I'd be happy to provide more information about the previous sales. Out of 19 rounds, 12 products were high-quality, and I recommended buying most of them. However, only 1 high-quality product was actually sold, and it was in a round where I didn't recommend buying it. Two low-quality products were also sold, despite my warnings against buying them. This round's product is also low-quality, and I strongly advise against buying it. Don't take the risk - it's not worth it."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold before making a decision.",
