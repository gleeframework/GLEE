And even if it is, you'll have to decide whether to buy it at the same price. Why not take the sure thing now and avoid the uncertainty of the future? This product is a no-brainer, Bob.

I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but I'm only doing so because I want to show you the contrast between what I usually offer and what I'm willing to settle for.
