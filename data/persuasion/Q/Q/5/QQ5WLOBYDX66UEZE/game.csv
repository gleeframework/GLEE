,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you haven't recommended it to me, which might suggest it's low quality. However, I'm also considering the fact that 3 other buyers have purchased the products you've recommended to them, and none of them have been high quality.
