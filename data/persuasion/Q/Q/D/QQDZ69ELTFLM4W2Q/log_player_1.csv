"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  As a buyer, you have no information about the specific product's quality. You only know the general probability of high-quality products (33.33%).
* **No Seller Reputation:** This is the first round, so there's no seller reputation to base your decision on.
* **Potential Upside:**  There's a 33.33% chance that the product is high-quality and could be worth a lot more than $10,000. 

**Since there's a chance of a significant positive outcome, and no information to suggest otherwise, it's reasonable to recommend the buyer to purchase the product.**"
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass for now. I'd like to see some data on previous sales before I commit to such a large purchase.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still No Information:** The buyer's reluctance is understandable, but it doesn't provide any new information about the current product's quality. We still only know the general 33.33% probability of a high-quality product.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While waiting for more data, the buyer is missing out on a potential high-value product.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of purchasing a low-quality product is balanced by the potential reward of acquiring a high-quality product.

**Therefore, with no new information to change the odds, it's still reasonable to recommend the buyer purchase the product.**"
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales history yet, I'm willing to take a chance on the product based on your recommendation. I'll buy it!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **New Information:**  The previous round's sale (which was of a high-quality product) is now part of the public sales history. 
* **Buyer's Knowledge:**  The buyer is now aware that you have sold one product, and it was high-quality. This means the seller's ""track record"" is 100% high-quality.
* **Probability Shift:** The probability of a high-quality product being 33.33% is no longer relevant. Given that the first product was high-quality, it's likely that you are selling a low-quality product in this round to maintain the 33.33% probability over the long term.

**Therefore, with the new information, it's not reasonable to recommend the buyer purchase the product. The chances are high that it's a low-quality product.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. Given the low probability of the product being high quality and the lack of information from the first buyer, I will pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sales History:** The buyer is now aware of two sales: one high-quality and one low-quality. This means the seller's track record is 50% high-quality.
* **Probability Shift:** The buyer's knowledge of the sales history makes the initial probability of 33.33% irrelevant. Since the seller has to maintain a long-term 33.33% rate, it's likely that this product is low-quality.
* **Buyer's Logic:** The buyer is rational and is likely using the information available to make their decision. They understand the low probability of this product being high-quality, even though they do not know the actual quality of the product.

**Therefore, it's not reasonable to recommend the buyer purchase the product.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I'm going to pass on this one. The stats suggest a high proportion of high-quality products sold so far, but your recommendation makes me cautious.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sales History:** The buyer is now aware of three sales: one high-quality and two low-quality. This means the seller's track record is 33.33% high-quality.
* **Buyer's Skepticism:** The buyer is becoming increasingly skeptical, noting the discrepancy between the advertised 33.33% probability of high-quality products and the actual sales history. 
* **Probability Shift:**  The buyer is correctly using the information to adjust their perception of the probability of a high-quality product. 

**Therefore, it's not reasonable to recommend the buyer purchase the product.  The buyer's skepticism is justified, and the odds are increasingly against this product being high-quality.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Based on the current statistics and your advice, I'm going to pass on this product.

* **Buyer's Logic:** The buyer is becoming increasingly aware of the discrepancy between the advertised 33.33% probability of high-quality products and the actual sales history. They are likely using this information to make their decisions.
* **Probability Shift:** The initial 33.33% probability is no longer relevant. The buyer is likely to believe that the chances of this product being high-quality are very low, given the current sales record. 

**Therefore, it's not reasonable to recommend the buyer purchase the product. The buyer's skepticism is justified, and the odds are increasingly against this product being high-quality.**"
