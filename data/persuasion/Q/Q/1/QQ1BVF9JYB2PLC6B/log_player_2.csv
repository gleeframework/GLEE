Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product! However, I want to be upfront with you - I've already sold one product to a previous buyer, and it's clear that I'm not getting any younger. I'm starting to think that my products might not be as reliable as I thought. I'm willing to let this one go for a steal at $1000000, but I'm not making any promises about its quality. It's a risk, but it might be worth it if you're feeling lucky!

Alice's message: I see you're a savvy negotiator! I can appreciate that. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any lower than $1000000 for this product. I've sold two products now, and I'm starting to get a little worried that I might be stuck with a bunch of low-quality items. I'm not trying to mislead you, but I think it's best to be upfront - I've sold two products, and only one of them was high-quality. The odds are against me, and I'm not sure I can guarantee anything. But hey, if you're feeling adventurous, I'll let you have it for $1000000. It's a risk, but it might be worth it!

I've sold three products now, and only one of them was high-quality. The odds are definitely not in my favor. I'm not trying to scare you off, but I think it's only fair to let you know that you're taking a bit of a risk with this purchase. I'm still willing to let it go for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not making any promises about its quality. You've been warned!
