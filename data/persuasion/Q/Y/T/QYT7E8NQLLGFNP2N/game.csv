,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to provide more information. I've implemented a new quality control checklist that includes multiple stages of inspection and testing before a product is shipped. For example, I've added a third-party inspection service to verify the product's specifications, and I've also increased the number of internal quality checks before packaging. In fact, I've seen a significant improvement in our quality metrics since implementing these changes. To give you a sense of our progress, out of the last 5 products I've sold, 3 have been high-quality. I'm confident that this product meets the highest standards, and I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. I'll give you a 10% discount on the price, bringing it down to $9000, if you're willing to take the product home with you today.",
