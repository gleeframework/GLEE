"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.** This means they expect an 80% chance of a product being worth $30,000.
* **The price is $10,000.**  Even with a 20% chance of the product being low-quality (worth $0), the expected value of the product for the buyer is positive: 
    * (0.8 * $30,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $24,000 
* **The expected value ($24,000) is significantly higher than the price ($10,000).** This makes it a good deal for the buyer, even with the risk of getting a low-quality product. 

Therefore, it's highly recommended to recommend the buyer to purchase the product."
