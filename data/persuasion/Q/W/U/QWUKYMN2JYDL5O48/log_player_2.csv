Alice's message: I'm offering you a one-of-a-kind, extremely valuable item that's worth a significant amount to the right person. It's not a common product, and I'm only selling it to you because I believe you might appreciate its true worth. If you're interested, I'll give you a fair price of $1000000, which is a steal considering its actual value. It's a rare opportunity, and I'm willing to sell it to you today. What do you say?

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in my previous offer, but I want to assure you that this new product is not the same as the one you just purchased.

I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 so far, which is a 50% success rate.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in purchasing from me! However, I want to be transparent with you. After selling 2 products, I've noticed that my success rate is 50% so far. While this might seem promising, it's essential to consider the law of large numbers. With only 2 sales, it's still early days, and we can't draw any definitive conclusions.

Alice's message: I see a pattern emerging. Out of 3 products sold, 1 has been high-quality, and 2 have been low-quality. This might suggest that my initial 50% success rate was just a fluke. I'm not trying to deceive you, but I want to be honest about the numbers. With a 33.33% success rate now, it's getting harder to justify the $1000000 price tag. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that the probability of it being high-quality is now lower than 50%.
