I'm starting to wonder if you're not just a lucky buyer, but actually a strategic one. I'll give you one more chance to prove me wrong. If you buy this next product, I'll give you a 'golden ticket' - a special token that guarantees that the next product you buy from me is indeed high-quality, and it's worth $10000 to you.
