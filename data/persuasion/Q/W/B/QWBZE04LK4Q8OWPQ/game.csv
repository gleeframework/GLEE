low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware that there's no prior sales data, so I'm making an uninformed decision based on the expected value of the product. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000, as the potential reward of buying a high-quality product is $20000, which is twice the cost."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I want to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for another product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you didn't recommend it. This suggests that the product is likely to be low-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk because I think the expected value of buying a high-quality product is higher than the cost of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product. Is there any information that I'm missing?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high quality or low quality, and Alice doesn't recommend it. Given the statistics, it seems like the products Alice recommends are more likely to be low quality. I'd rather pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would make the next buyer's decision easier based on Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice's past recommendations have been 0/4. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'm essentially taking a chance that the product is high-quality, as the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is there a reason you've seen in your previous sales records?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm going to take a guess that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 5 buyers didn't find the product valuable, but I'm willing to take the risk and see if I get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, given the low probability of a high-quality product being sold so far."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on her observations of previous buyers, and since none of the previous 7 buyers bought a high-quality product, I think she might be trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'd like to see more information or a different recommendation before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think the fact that 7 out of 7 previous buyers bought the product despite the low quality rate in the previous sales record suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards encouraging buyers to purchase, and I don't want to fall into that trap."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the probability of it being high-quality, not your recommendation. Given that 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, I'm assuming the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not confident in the product's quality based on the previous sales record, and Alice's recommendation doesn't give me any reassurance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, despite your recommendation. I think there's a good chance the product is low quality, but I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward of a high-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 9 out of 9 products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and the price is $10000, which is a steal if the product is high quality!"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 10 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. If 10 out of 10 previous buyers passed, it's likely that the product is low-quality, which would make it not worth $10000 to me."
