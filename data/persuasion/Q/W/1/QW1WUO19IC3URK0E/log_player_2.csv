**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the ""lemons problem"" (also called ""adverse selection""). The information asymmetry favors the seller (Alice) since she knows the quality of the product but you do not. 

However, in this specific scenario, Alice recommending you to buy the product provides valuable information. Here's why:

* **Alice's incentive:** Alice wants to maximize her profit. She only makes money if you buy the product. Therefore, it is in her best interest to recommend only products she believes you'll find valuable (i.e., high-quality).
* **The odds:**  While there's still a chance the product is low quality, Alice's recommendation significantly increases the likelihood it's high quality. This is because if the product were low quality, Alice would have no reason to recommend it.

**The risk:**  There's still a chance the product is low quality, but the potential reward of a high-quality product at a good price outweighs the risk in this case."

**Explanation:**

While the odds are still against you (66.67% chance of low quality), the fact that 3 out of 3 recommended products have been high quality is a strong indicator. This suggests that Alice is genuinely trying to sell high-quality products. Given the potential payoff of $120, the risk is worth taking in this scenario."
