high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that there's a 50% chance it might be low quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the quality of the product, and Alice's recommendation is based on the previous buyer who bought a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product. What was the probability of the high-quality product being sold to them given the previous sales record?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the first buyer bought a high-quality product, but I'm not convinced that this product will be high-quality. I'd like to wait and see if Alice's recommendation changes after more buyers have purchased products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I would like to pass on the current product, as I think the probability of it being high quality is lower than 50% given the previous sales record."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the current statistics, I think the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%, so I'd rather not take the risk."

,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there a specific reason you're advising me not to buy it?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given that you recommended not to buy it.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation based on the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because you think the product is low-quality, or is it because you think it's high-quality and you're trying to reserve it for someone else?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk and possibly get a high-quality product for $10000, which would be a great deal for me."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the sales record.
