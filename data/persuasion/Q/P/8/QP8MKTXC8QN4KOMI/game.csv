,,Alice,5,"I've now sold 2 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products, out of a total of 5 products offered.

Would you like to take a chance on this one for $100?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the current statistics, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $100 on a low-quality product.",no
