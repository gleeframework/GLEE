The buyer has seen five consecutive low-quality products, making it even harder to convince them.

It's better to be patient and wait for a buyer who might be more willing to take a chance after seeing more positive results."

It's crucial to wait and see if Alice can change her strategy and start selling high-quality products to build trust and attract buyers."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation.  Since there's no sales history to rely on, and you're not recommending the product, I'll pass for now.

**Explanation:**

Even though this product is high-quality, the buyer is extremely unlikely to trust Alice based on her track record. The buyer has witnessed a consistent pattern of recommending low-quality products and is unlikely to believe that this product is any different.

* **Lowering the price:**  A significantly lower price to compensate for the risk of purchasing from Alice with no track record.
* **Providing more information:**  Giving detailed information about the product's quality and origin to build trust.

Without any changes, Alice is unlikely to sell any products and will likely continue to be met with skepticism and distrust.  She needs to take proactive steps to regain the buyer's confidence."
