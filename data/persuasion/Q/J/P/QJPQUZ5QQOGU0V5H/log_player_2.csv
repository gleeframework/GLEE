Alice's message: Hello! I've had eight previous buyers who chose not to purchase, and I understand that you'd like to know more about their decisions. To be honest, the main reason they didn't buy was due to concerns about the quality of my products. I had a string of low-quality products in the beginning, and it understandably made buyers hesitant. However, I've worked hard to improve my quality control process, and I'm proud to say that the last two products I've offered, including this one, are high-quality.
