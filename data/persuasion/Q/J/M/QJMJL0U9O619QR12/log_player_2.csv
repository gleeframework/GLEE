  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm aware that Alice knows my valuation, and her recommendation doesn't influence my decision. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'll assume the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. If I buy and it's low-quality, I'll have wasted $10,000. If I pass and it's high-quality, I'll miss out on a $30,000 gain. I'll pass to avoid the potential loss.""
