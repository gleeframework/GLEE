,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products, and I'm glad to have another opportunity to sell a high-quality one. Since I've already sold one high-quality product, the probability that this one is also high-quality is still 80%.

I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to be transparent about the risks. If you're willing to take a chance, you might get a great deal, but there's also a possibility that you'll end up with a low-quality product.",
