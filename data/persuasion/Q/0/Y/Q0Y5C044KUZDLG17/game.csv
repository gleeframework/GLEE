,,Alice,1,This product is of exceptional quality and will meet your expectations.,
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm only buying it because I have no information about its quality, and I'm hoping it's the high-quality one. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to acknowledge that there's a 66.67% chance it's actually low quality.",yes

,,Alice,2,This product has been carefully selected for its unique characteristics.,
,,Bob,2,"I'm not buying this product. Given that I just bought a high-quality product in the previous round, I'm going to assume that the probability of this product being high-quality is now 33.33% (since the product in the previous round was high-quality), and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. The expected value of buying this product is (0.3333 * 2000000) + (0.6667 * 0) = $666.67, which is lower than the price of $1000000. Therefore, I'm choosing to pass on this product.",no
