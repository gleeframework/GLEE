I'll give you an additional 10% off the price, making it $9000. This is the lowest price I can offer for this product. It's a great opportunity to get a good deal on a product that still has some value to you, even if it's not as high-quality as the previous one. What do you think?",

,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'll be honest with you - this product is not worth much to anyone. But, I'm willing to make a deal with you. If you buy this product, I'll throw in a second product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. This second product is a high-quality one, and it's worth $40000 to you. So, you'll get two products for the price of one. The total price for both products is still $10000.
