high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to know the statistics before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3. This is lower than the expected 80% chance of a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the previous sales record. The fact that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases suggests that the previous buyers were more likely to buy high-quality products, which may not reflect the overall quality of the products available. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is available."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the product and see the recommendation for the next buyer. I want to observe more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample size and I'm willing to take the risk. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high quality is still 80%."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/4. Given the low-quality products have a 20% chance of being sold, I think it's possible that the low-quality products have been sold more frequently than high-quality ones. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I would like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the 80% chance I was told. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5 purchases, which suggests a lower proportion of high-quality products than the 80% probability. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
