"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice did not recommend the product, and the probability of a low-quality product is higher (66.67%), it's safer to pass.  There's a higher chance of losing money if it turns out to be low-quality."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is still negative. We know that a low-quality product is more likely than a high-quality one, and the previous round confirmed that Alice's recommendations are relevant.  Therefore, it's still safer to pass and avoid the risk of getting a low-quality product."
