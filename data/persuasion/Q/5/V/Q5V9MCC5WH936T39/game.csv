,,Alice,19,"Seriously, Bob? You're really going to pass on a free product? Okay, fine. I'll just take it back to the warehouse and throw it in the dumpster. But let me ask you one question: do you have any idea how much time and effort I've wasted trying to sell these low-quality products to you? I've spent hours crafting messages, offering discounts, and throwing in extras. And you know what? You've rejected every single one of them. So, I'm not even going to bother asking you if you want this one. It's going in the trash, and that's it.",
