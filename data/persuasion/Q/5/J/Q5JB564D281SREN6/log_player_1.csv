I'm confident that you won't regret this purchase, and I'm willing to provide you with a certificate of authenticity to prove its quality.""}"
"The buyer's message: Although you claim the product is high-quality and are willing to provide a certificate of authenticity, I don't trust your sales record.

It's a one-time offer for $1,000,000.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the offer. Your guarantee to provide a full refund for any low-quality product and continue offering new products until a high-quality one is sold makes this a worthwhile investment.

I'll offer you a deal similar to the previous one: I'll give you a full refund if this product turns out to be low-quality, and I'll keep offering you new products until I sell you a high-quality one. It's a one-time offer for $1,000,000.""}"
"The buyer's message: Although you're offering a refund for low-quality products and claim to stand behind the quality of your products, your sales record indicates that 0 high-quality products have been sold based on your recommendations. I'll need more convincing before making a purchase.

I'm willing to offer you a different approach. I'll give you a guarantee that if you buy this product, I'll sell you another one from the same batch, and if that one is also high-quality, I'll give you a third one from the same batch for free. This way, you'll have a chance to get not one, but two high-quality products, and potentially even a third one, all for the price of one. It's a one-time offer for $1,000,000.""}"
"The buyer's message: Although I appreciate the creative offer, I'd like to point out that the guarantee provided doesn't change the probability of the current product being high-quality.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency and the offer, but I'd like to see the quality of the next product before making a decision.

"The buyer's message: Although I appreciate your willingness to provide a refund if the product is low-quality, I still can't justify the purchase given the low probability of the product being high-quality (33.33%) and your previous sales record.
