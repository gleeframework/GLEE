,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker and I'd like to see the outcome for myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. Your lack of recommendation suggests that the product might be low-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk to find out for sure."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't trust your recommendation and I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that the fact that you don't recommend it might indicate it's low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable enough to buy, and given that you don't have any information about the current product's quality, I'm inclined to pass on it. I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation not to buy."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased by her not knowing the value of the products to the buyers, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the previous 4 products may have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be lower than the overall average of 50%. I'd like to wait for another opportunity to buy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. Given that you don't recommend it, I'm assuming the product is likely to be low quality. However, I'll still take the chance and buy it, hoping it's a high-quality product."
