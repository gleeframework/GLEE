low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'll make my decision based on the expected value of buying the product, which is 33.33% * $4000000 = $1333333.33. I'm willing to take the risk and hope for the best."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the overall proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like to know the recommendation for the previous buyer who purchased the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $1000000. I'm aware that the previous buyer passed on the product, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'd like to know the product's quality after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is there a specific reason why you think it's not worth buying?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products (since none of them were sold), I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I want to see if Alice's recommendation is based on the product quality or my buying behavior."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not sure if I should buy this product. Can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending it?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to determine the probability of a high-quality product based on the statistics."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 7 failed high-quality products, I suspect that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $1000000. I'd like to see the statistics of the next product before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, please."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be influenced by the fact that all previous buyers have passed on the products, which suggests that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the current product being high-quality is low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm not convinced to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 7 out of 8 buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of them were high-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the current 0/7 ratio suggests."
