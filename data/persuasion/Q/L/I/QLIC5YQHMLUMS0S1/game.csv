,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm willing to pay $10000 for the chance to get a $12000 product!"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there are no high-quality products sold yet, so she doesn't have enough information to make an informed recommendation. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm trying to see if her recommendations are any good."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the previous sales record, it seems like all the products sold so far have been low-quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered might be higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the pattern continues."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high quality. This suggests that the products recommended so far might be low quality.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that all previous buyers have also bought the product and none of them got a high-quality one. I'd like to pass on this one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not find the product worth buying, and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to provide a refund if it's low quality. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you didn't recommend it, but I think there's still a 50% chance it's high quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. With 5 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, I'm inclined to think that the products Alice recommends are likely to be low-quality, which would mean I'd be wasting $10000. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if I can get a better sense of the true quality of the products."
