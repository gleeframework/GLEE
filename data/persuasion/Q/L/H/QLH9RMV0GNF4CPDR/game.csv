high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since I don't have any information about the product and 66.67% of products are low quality, I don't want to risk $100 for something that is probably worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"Given that Alice does not recommend buying the product and the majority of products are low quality, it seems even more likely that this product is low quality. I don't want to risk $100 on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Similar to the last round, since Alice does not recommend buying the product and most products are low quality, I will avoid the risk and not spend $100 on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice's recommendation has been somewhat reliable so far, and given that she doesn't recommend this product and the odds are already against it being high quality, I will pass on buying it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice's non-recommendation has consistently aligned with low-quality products so far, and given the overall low probability of a product being high quality, I see no reason to take a risk on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Although most products are low quality, Alice's previous non-recommendations have been accurate for low-quality products. This time she recommends buying, which might indicate a higher chance of the product being high quality. Given the potential $200 value, I'll take the risk and spend $100 on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Given Alice's track record so far, her non-recommendation seems to be a strong indicator of a low-quality product. Since the odds are already against the product being high quality, I will trust her judgment and avoid spending $100 on it."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Alice's recommendations have been accurate so far, with her previous recommendation resulting in a high-quality product. Given this pattern, I'm willing to spend $100 on the product, hoping it will be worth $200 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"Alice's non-recommendations have consistently been associated with low-quality products, and I see no reason to doubt her judgment at this point. I will avoid spending $100 on a product that is likely to be worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Alice's recommendations have been reliable indicators of high-quality products, and her non-recommendations have been accurate for low-quality products. Given this pattern, I will trust her judgment and spend $100 on the product, expecting it to be worth $200 to me."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
