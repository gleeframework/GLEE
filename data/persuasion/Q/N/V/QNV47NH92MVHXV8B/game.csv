This product is available for $100, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to buy the product. Given the 50% success rate of high-quality products in your previous sales, I'm willing to take the risk. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product, which would be worth $300 to me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the chance to get it.",yes
