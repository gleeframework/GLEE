,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and she might be trying to get rid of the low-quality products first. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the overall proportion of high-quality products in your sales record so far. If it's less than 0.8, I'll reconsider."

,,Alice,10,yes,

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, given the low probability of it being low quality and the potential reward of it being high quality."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, which is 0 out of 3. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that Alice doesn't know my valuation, and my decision is based on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 80%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low quality. The probability of the current product being high quality is 80%. I'd like to pass on this product to avoid the potential loss."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that all previous buyers have also bought the product despite the 0 high-quality products sold so far. This suggests that the previous buyers may have been misled by Alice's recommendations, and I'd like to make my own decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the statistics and Alice's recommendation. With 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it seems like the products sold so far were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of low-quality products is 1. This is higher than the expected 0.2, suggesting that the remaining products may be more likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk."
