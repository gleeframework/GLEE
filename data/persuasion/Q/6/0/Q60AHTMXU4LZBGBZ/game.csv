,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendation. I'd like to know the statistics after my decision, so I can make a more informed decision for the next product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product, I think it's too early to make a decision based on the limited data. I'd like to see more sales and recommendations before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of this product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?

high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the limited data, the recommendation seems too optimistic given the low number of sales. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 total product sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 100%. This is likely due to chance, and I don't want to overpay for a product that may be low quality. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sale. With only one high-quality product sold out of one product sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is 1/1 = 100%. However, I'm not convinced that the product I'm being offered is the high-quality one. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer will buy it."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if it's high quality or low quality, but I don't want to take the risk without knowing Alice's recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product's quality?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 sold. This means that 20% of the products are low-quality. I'm not convinced that this product is worth the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'm not going to buy it. I think Alice's recommendation is biased because she knows the quality of the product and wants to make a sale. I'd like to pass and let the next buyer make a decision.
