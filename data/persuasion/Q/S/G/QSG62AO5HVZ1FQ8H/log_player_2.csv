"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's a higher chance the product is low quality, it's still a gamble worth taking.  Here's why:

* **Potential Reward:** If it's high quality, you make a profit of $10,000.
* **No Loss:** If it's low quality, you only lose the $10,000 you paid.

This strategy is based on the potential for a large reward outweighing the risk of a smaller loss."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.  I trust your judgment, and I'll see what you have to offer next round.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable signal. Since she's not recommending this product, it's likely she believes it's low quality.  As a buyer, it's wise to trust her expertise, especially since the risk/reward is not as favorable as in the first round.  Passing on this product allows me to conserve my funds and potentially find a better opportunity in future rounds."

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal, especially after the previous round where her non-recommendation was correct.  Even though there's a higher chance of the product being low quality, there's also a chance it's high quality, and the potential reward of $10,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 

We're essentially back to the same decision point as Round 1: a gamble with potential for high reward.  However, Alice's track record now adds a bit more weight to her recommendation, making it a more informed gamble."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a consistent ability to predict product quality.  Since she's not recommending this product, the risk of buying it is too high.
