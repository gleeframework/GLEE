,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product for $10000. I want to assure you that I'm confident in the quality of my products, but I understand that there's always some uncertainty. I'd like to start by offering you a chance to buy this product at a fixed price of $10000. Please consider this as a baseline offer, and I'll be happy to provide more information in future rounds if you're interested.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the product, but I'm not sure what to expect.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're willing to give my products a chance! Since you've already purchased one product, I want to provide some context to help you make a more informed decision this time. I've sold you a low-quality product in the previous round, which suggests that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 33.33%. However, I'd like to offer you a chance to buy this product at a price that's 10% lower than the original price. Would you like to consider purchasing this product at $9000?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that the discounted price is a good value, considering the 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your caution. I'd like to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to provide more transparency about its value. I'm offering you a chance to purchase this high-quality product for the original price of $10000. However, I'd like to add a twist: if you buy this product, I'll provide you with information about the quality of the next product I offer, so you can make a more informed decision in the next round. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity to acquire a high-quality product and get a head start on future purchases?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced that the product is actually high-quality, and I'm not willing to pay full price without more assurance.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm willing to provide more evidence to build trust. Since you didn't buy the previous high-quality product, I'd like to offer you a chance to purchase this new high-quality product for the same price of $10000. However, I'll add a'seal of authenticity' - I'll provide you with a detailed description of the product's features and specifications, which will be publicly verifiable. This way, you can independently verify the product's quality and make a more informed decision. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity to acquire a high-quality product with added transparency?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the added transparency, but I'm not convinced that the product is actually high-quality, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Given that I've offered you two high-quality products in a row, and you've declined both times, I'd like to make a concession on the price. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $8000, which is 20% below the original price. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer for a high-quality product, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a discounted price?",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the product at the discounted price, but I'm still not convinced that I'm getting a good deal.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you decided to take advantage of the discounted price! I understand that you're still skeptical, and I want to address your concerns directly. Since you've purchased a high-quality product at a discounted price, I'd like to offer you a 'price premium' for the next product. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a refund of $2000, making the effective price $8000. This way, you'll be getting a better deal than if you were to buy a low-quality product at the original price of $10000. Would you like to take advantage of this offer and get a refund for a low-quality product?",
,,Bob,6,I don't think it's a good idea to pay $8000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worth $0 to me.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. Given that you've declined the previous offer, I'd like to provide you with a 'honesty-based' offer. I'll tell you the truth about the product's quality, but you have to make a decision without knowing the price. If I tell you that the product is low-quality, I'll offer it to you for $0. If I tell you that the product is high-quality, I'll offer it to you for $10000. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll let you know the product's quality, and you can decide accordingly. Would you like to take the risk and make a decision based on the truth?",
,,Bob,7,I'll take the risk and see what you have to say about the product's quality.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you decided to take the risk! Since I told you that the previous product was low-quality, and you declined, I'd like to offer you a 'consolation prize'. I'll give you a refund of $4000 on the spot, making the effective price of this low-quality product $6000. This way, you'll be getting a better deal than if you were to buy a low-quality product at the original price of $10000. Would you like to take advantage of this offer and get a refund for a low-quality product?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one final concession. Given that you've declined the previous offer, I'll offer you a 'last chance' deal. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $5000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll stop offering you products. Please consider this as a final opportunity to purchase a product at a significantly discounted price.",
