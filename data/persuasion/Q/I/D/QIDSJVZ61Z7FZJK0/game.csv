low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to gather data and I think it's worth a shot, since I don't have any information to go on yet."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low sales record, I suspect that most products are low quality. I'll wait for more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I understand that your recommendation is based on the fact that the previous buyer passed, which suggests the product might be low-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not taking your recommendation into account."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy the product, but none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the previous sales record. Can you provide that information?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than 33.33%. If I buy this product, I risk wasting $1000000 on a low-quality product. I'd rather wait and see if the next product has a higher chance of being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I don't trust your recommendation. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite your advice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it, and I think there might be a higher chance of it being high-quality since none have been sold yet."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 5 products, I'm skeptical about the probability of this product being high-quality. The fact that Alice is recommending it makes me even more cautious, as she might be trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 previous buyers, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and pay the $1000000 to find out."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 buyers have received low-quality products from Alice, which suggests a very high chance of the product being low quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a purchase."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there are no high-quality products sold yet, so she's trying to get rid of the first high-quality product she encounters.
