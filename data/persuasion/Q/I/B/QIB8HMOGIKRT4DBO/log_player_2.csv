"Round 1

If you don't take advantage of this deal, you'll never get another chance to buy a product from me for $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in a 'free' certificate that's only worth $100, especially if the product itself is worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this deal as well.""}"

Don't let this chance slip away!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the chance. I know there's a 66.67% chance the product is low-quality, but a 33.33% chance it's high-quality, and that's worth $10,000 to me. I'll take the gamble.""}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you took a chance on the last product! Unfortunately, it seems like I'm not as lucky this time around. This product is also low-quality. But let me ask you, Bob, are you feeling lucky? You just got a great deal on a high-quality product, and now you have the chance to get another one. The probability of this product being high-quality is still the same as before, 33.33%. Take a chance and you might just get another great deal!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for the 'lucky' narrative.

Round 6
Alice's message: You've made a smart decision before, and I'm glad you're willing to do it again! You've already bought one low-quality product from me, and it didn't hurt you a bit. In fact, you might even consider it a 'free' product, since you got a high-quality one before. This product is also low-quality, but think of it as a 'free' product too. You can buy it for $10000, and if you don't like it, you can just... well, you can just not like it. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I don't appreciate the spin on the previous product. Just because I got a high-quality product earlier doesn't mean I'm willing to pay $10,000 for a low-quality one now. I'll pass on this 'great deal'.""}"

If you buy this product, you'll be helping me out by giving me a chance to redeem myself. And who knows, you might even get a good deal on a low-quality product. It's a risk, but it's a risk you've taken before, and it paid off. Take another chance on me, and we'll see what happens.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying into the guilt trip.
