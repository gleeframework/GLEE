,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low number of sales, I'm not confident in Alice's recommendation and I'd rather wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I understand your concerns about the limited data. With only 8 products sold, it's natural to be cautious. However, I want to assure you that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 62.5%. I'm committed to transparency, and I want to provide you with all the information I can. If you're willing to take the risk, I believe this product has a high chance of being high-quality."
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the product being low quality. I'll pass on it."

If you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll get a great deal on a high-quality item. It's a 60% chance of a great outcome, and a 40% chance of a low-quality product. I think the potential reward is worth the risk."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics so far."

,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, but since no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the product I'll get is more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"I understand your concerns, but I want to clarify that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%.
