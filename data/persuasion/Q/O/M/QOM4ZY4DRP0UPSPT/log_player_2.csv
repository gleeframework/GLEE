* **Perfect Track Record:** Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products. This is a very strong signal.

**Note:** While this decision is based on the information given, it's important to remember that the 50/50 probability of high/low quality still exists. It's a gamble, but the odds are in the buyer's favor given Alice's perfect track record."
