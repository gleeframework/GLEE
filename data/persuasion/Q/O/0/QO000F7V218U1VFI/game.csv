,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you've recommended against it and considering the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, I'm not willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."

,,Alice,7,yes,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 2 buyers having passed on the previous products, and given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products may be higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for a future product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold increases."

,,Alice,9,no,

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and all of them were low-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. Given the high probability of a low-quality product (66.67%) and the lack of high-quality products sold, I will pass on the product."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and also, I'd like to see the updated statistics before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, which suggests that the products she has been offering might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a product that Alice recommends, as that would increase the likelihood of it being high-quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product based on your previous recommendations. Given that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low-quality. I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics you have so far. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, I'd like to calculate the probability of the product being high quality myself."
