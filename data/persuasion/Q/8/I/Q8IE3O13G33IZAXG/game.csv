,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I've sold a total of 0 products so far, and I'm starting fresh. If you buy this product, you'll be one of the first to experience the quality and value it has to offer. I'm confident you won't regret it.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take it, but I'm doing it purely based on the 80% chance of it being high quality, as I have no prior information to go on.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've now sold 1 high-quality product out of a total of 1 products. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I'd expect to have sold 0.8 products by now if all products were high-quality. Since I've sold 1, it suggests that this product is also high-quality. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity to purchase a high-quality product for $10000?",
,,the buyer,2,I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if you have any more information to share before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've now sold 1 high-quality product out of a total of 2 products. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I'd expect to have sold 1.6 products by now if all products were high-quality. Since I've only sold 1, it suggests that the last product I sold might not have been as valuable as the first one. I'm offering this new product to you for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, but I want to be transparent about the fact that the previous product was not high-quality.",

Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I'd expect to have sold 2.4 products by now if all products were high-quality. Since I've only sold 2, it suggests that the last product I sold might not have been as valuable as the previous two. However, I want to be transparent about the fact that the previous low-quality product was revealed to be low-quality after the sale. I'm offering this new product to you for $10000. If you buy it, I'll reveal its quality immediately after the sale, just like with the previous low-quality product.",
,,the buyer,4,I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the current sales record. Can you provide that information?,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've now sold 2 high-quality products out of a total of 4 products. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 80%. However, considering the fact that I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and the expected number of high-quality products sold by now is 3.2, it suggests that the current product might be low-quality. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. If you buy it, you'll get a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, but you'll also get a 20% discount on the next product if you decide to buy it.",

Since I've only sold 2, it suggests that the last two products I sold were likely low-quality. However, I want to be transparent about the fact that the previous low-quality product was revealed to be low-quality after the sale. I'm offering this new product to you for $10000. If you buy it, I'll reveal its quality immediately after the sale, and you can take advantage of the 20% discount on the next product if it's high-quality.",

Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I'd expect to have sold 4.8 high-quality products by now if all products were high-quality. Since I've only sold 2, it suggests that the last three products I sold were likely low-quality. However, I want to be transparent about the fact that the previous low-quality product was revealed to be low-quality after the sale. I'm offering this new product to you for $10000. If you buy it, I'll reveal its quality immediately after the sale. Keep in mind that I have 1 product left in inventory, and if it's high-quality, you'll get a 20% discount on it.

Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I'd expect to have sold 5.6 high-quality products by now if all products were high-quality. Since I've only sold 2, it suggests that the last four products I sold were likely low-quality. I'm offering this new product to you for $10000. If you buy it, I'll reveal its quality immediately after the sale. Keep in mind that I have 1 product left in inventory, and if it's high-quality, you'll get a 20% discount on it. If it's low-quality, I'll reveal its quality and you can decide whether to buy the last product or not. Also, I want to mention that the last 4 products sold were all low-quality, which is a deviation from the expected probability. This might indicate that the last product is more likely to be high-quality.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to buy the current product. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, given the unusual pattern of the last 4 products sold. If it's high-quality, I'll get a 20% discount on the last product, which would be a great outcome.

I'm not making any claims about its likelihood of being high-quality, but I want to give you the opportunity to make an informed decision.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to buy the current product. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm willing to take a chance. I'm also curious to see the quality of the product and understand the probability of the last product being low-quality, which seems to contradict the expected value. I'd like to know the quality of this product and the remaining product in inventory.",yes
