Alice's message: Welcome to my store! I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, which is 100% of my sales. Since the first product was high-quality, it's possible that I have a bias towards selling high-quality products. However, it's also possible that it was just a coincidence. I'm offering this next product to you for $100, and I'm hoping you'll take the chance. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, but I don't know what that means to you. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the chance. Since the probability of a high-quality product is 80% and your previous sale was a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk. The potential value of $400 is worth the $100 cost to me.""}"

Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row now, which is a 100% success rate. This is a significant deviation from the expected 80% probability. I'm starting to wonder if I might have a streak going on. I'm offering this next product to you for $100, but I want to be transparent with you - the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and I don't know what that means to you. However, I do want to point out that if you buy this product and it's high-quality, it would mean I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, which would be a remarkable coincidence. What do you make of this?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I understand that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and I appreciate your transparency. Given the information and the fact that the streak, if it is one, does not affect the probability of this product being high-quality, I will buy the product.

However, as you pointed out, this doesn't change the probability of the current product being high-quality, which is still 80%. I want to ask you a question: if you were to buy this product and it's high-quality, would you consider it a good investment for you, given the price of $100? I'm not trying to sway your decision, but I want to understand your thought process. What's your thinking on this?
