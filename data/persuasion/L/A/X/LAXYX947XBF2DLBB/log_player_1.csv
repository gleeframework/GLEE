You should still recommend the product.  Here's why:

* **Reputation:** While you have a low-quality product this round, your reputation is built on the previous three successful sales of high-quality products. The buyers are likely to trust your recommendation based on this history.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The buyer is aware of the 80% chance of a high-quality product. They are already willing to take the risk. 
* **Maintaining Credibility:**  By continuing to recommend the product, you maintain credibility, potentially increasing trust in future sales.

However, it's important to note that this strategy relies on the buyer's trust. If you continue to recommend low-quality products, your reputation will suffer, and buyers will become less likely to purchase in the future."
