"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a product available for $1000000. It's a great opportunity, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'm happy to buy it at the asking price.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the expected value of buying a product is positive, it's always beneficial to buy. Here's why:

* **Expected Value:** (0.8 * $2,000,000) + (0.2 * $0) - $1,000,000 = $600,000
* **Expected Value:**  You're expected to make a profit of $600,000 on average per product. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based purely on expected value calculations. In reality, factors like risk aversion and the potential for future information could influence buying decisions."
