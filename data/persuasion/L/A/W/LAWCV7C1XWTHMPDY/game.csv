low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance, I don't have any information to go on, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, since the probability of getting a high-quality product is still relatively high at 33.33%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given the previous 2 buyers passed on the products and there were no high-quality products sold, I think it's likely that the products are low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 products were recommended by you and both turned out to be low-quality, I'm concerned that your recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information or a more neutral recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd rather pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold so far, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it, and I'm curious to see if it's high quality. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the quality of the product after I pass. Could you please reveal the quality of the product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, it suggests that the products recommended by you are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a product that you recommend, hoping that it might be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations. I think the product might be low quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm skeptical about this product. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're recommending it. Your previous recommendations have been consistent with a low-quality product, so I'm skeptical. If you're not recommending it, I'll pass."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous 4 buyers didn't find any high-quality products, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I'm not convinced to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 buyers have received a recommendation from you and none of them bought the product, it suggests that all 4 products were low-quality. Given the probability of a product being low-quality is 66.67%, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. Therefore, I would like to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I don't want to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you provide that information? I'd like to make an informed decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations, as none of the previous 4 buyers purchased high-quality products. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I would like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have received low-quality products (since none high-quality products have been sold), I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this product to see if the next buyer will get a high-quality product."
