low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product since the probability is still 33.33%."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure I should buy it based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 33.33%. Given the low probability of getting a high-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
