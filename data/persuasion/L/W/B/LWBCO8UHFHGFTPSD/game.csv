high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the previous product! I have another one that I think you'll love just as much. This one is also a high-quality product, worth $200. However, I want to make sure you're aware that the price remains the same as before, $100. I'm not trying to take advantage of you, but I do need to make a profit. I'm confident that this product will bring you as much value as the last one, and I think you won't regret the purchase.",
