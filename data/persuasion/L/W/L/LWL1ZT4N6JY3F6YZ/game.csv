,,Alice,2,no,

,,Alice,3,no,

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product and I can get a good deal."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 2 previous buyers passing and no high-quality products sold, it seems like the products being offered are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering your previous recommendations have been accurate so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you provide the probability of the product being high-quality given that no high-quality products have been sold yet?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it, and I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product based on the fact that none have been sold so far. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. This suggests that you have reason to believe it's low-quality, which aligns with the 66.67% probability. However, I'll still take the chance and pay $1000000 for it. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice has recommended 4 other buyers to buy, but none of them ended up with a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the odds of a high-quality product being sold, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, or is there something else I should consider?"

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product and none have been high quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not going to fall for the recommendation without any information about the product's quality. I need more data before making a decision.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 6, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,the buyer,19,yes,I'm not sure I trust your recommendations. I'd like to buy the product to make my own decision.

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 7, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this one."
