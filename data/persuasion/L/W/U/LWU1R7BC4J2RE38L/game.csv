,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'll take the risk, as I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on the statistics."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. The fact that 2 out of 2 products were low quality suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer will make a different decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still quite low. I'll wait for the next one."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, I've seen that 2 buyers have already purchased the products, and none of them were high-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to pass on this product to avoid wasting my money. I'd like to ask Alice if she can provide more information about the products she has available or if she can give me a refund for the opportunity cost of considering this purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and both were low-quality products. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, this seems suspiciously high. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice has been recommending low-quality products to the previous buyers, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher. I'd like to pass on this one and see if Alice's recommendation changes for the next buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is it because of the low sales record or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to trust her judgment. However, I'm also aware that the product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality.
