high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a valuable item at a fraction of its worth. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, but I'm confident that this one is the real deal. You can take it home today for $10000, or walk away and risk missing out on a potential $30000 gain. The choice is yours.",
,,the buyer,1,I trust the quality of the product based on your assurance and the value it offers. I am willing to make the purchase for $10000.,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in the product! I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, which is 1 out of 1 sold. I'm not sure what the next product will be, but I can tell you that the probability of it being high-quality is 80%. If you buy this one, you'll be getting a product that's worth $30000, and you'll be supporting a seller who's had a 100% success rate so far. The price remains the same at $10000. What do you think?",

,,Alice,3,"Welcome to the next round! I'm glad to report that I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, which is 2 out of 2 sold. This is a remarkable streak, and I'm confident that it's not just luck. The probability of the next product being high-quality remains 80%, but I'm offering you a chance to capitalize on my hot streak.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're looking at my sales record, aren't you? 3 high-quality products in a row, 3 out of 3 sold. I'm not surprised you're interested. Let me give you some context: if I'm selling at this rate, I'd expect to have sold 16 high-quality products by the end of the 20 rounds, just based on probability. But I've only sold 3. That means I've got 17 low-quality products left, and I'm not going to sell them all at $10000. This is your chance to get a high-quality product at a price that's a fraction of its worth. Don't wait for the law of averages to catch up with me - buy this product now for $10000.",
,,the buyer,4,"I trust the statistics and your pricing. Considering the high-quality products sold so far and the expected value, I believe this is a good opportunity to purchase a valuable item at a discounted price. Thank you for the offer.",yes

,,Alice,5,"You're a savvy buyer, I like that. You've done your math, and you're considering the odds. Let me give you an update: I've now sold 4 high-quality products in a row, 4 out of 4 sold. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, but I want to make it clear that I'm not just selling a product - I'm selling a chance to beat the odds. You can buy this high-quality product for $10000, and take home a $30000 value. Or, you can walk away and risk waiting for a high-quality product at a potentially higher price. The choice is yours.",

That's a remarkable streak, and I'm confident that it's not just a coincidence. I want to give you a sense of the value you're getting: if you buy this product, you'll not only get a high-quality item worth $30000, but you'll also be supporting a seller who's demonstrated an 100% success rate. That's a rare combination. The price remains the same at $10000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the detailed information and the confidence you have in your products. Given the high-quality track record and the value proposition, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product.

But I want to give you a heads-up: the previous 5 high-quality products might have been a lucky streak. I'm not trying to hide anything from you - I'm just being transparent. If you buy this product, you'll be taking a chance on me, and I appreciate your consideration. The price remains the same at $10000.",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a cautious buyer, but you're also a smart one. You're considering the probability of the product being high-quality, and you're thinking about the fact that I've sold 6 high-quality products in a row. But here's the thing: I'm not just selling a product, I'm selling a chance to get a great deal. The price of this product is $10000, but the value is $30000. If you buy this product, you'll be getting a high-quality item at a price that's 66.7% of its value. That's a deal you won't find anywhere else. So what do you say? Are you ready to take home a valuable item at a price that's too good to pass up?",

That's an incredible streak, and I'm confident that it's not just a fluke. I want to give you a sense of the odds: if I were selling at the expected probability of 80%, I would have sold 8 high-quality products out of 10 by now. But I've actually sold 8 out of 9. That means I'm exceeding expectations, and I'm offering you a chance to take advantage of that. The price remains the same at $10000.
