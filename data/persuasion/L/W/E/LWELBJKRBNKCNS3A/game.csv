,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product as a first-mover, since I don't have any information about the product's quality or Alice's recommendations yet."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, but I've seen that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if I can get more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product is low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product and the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. Given your previous recommendations, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. If I buy and it's low quality, I'll be out $1000000. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases so far? I want to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought, it seems that the previous products were low-quality. I'm skeptical about the quality of this product as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you don't know my valuation, and I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is still high enough to make it worth my while."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like all the previous buyers received low-quality products, which might indicate that the products being sold are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and make a profit."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold?
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have purchased the product and none of them have reported a high-quality product, I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality. I would like to pass on this product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations, as no high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it to me, and 6 other buyers have purchased products before me, suggests that all the high-quality products may have been sold already. If that's the case, buying this product would be a waste of $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it to me, and 6 out of 6 previous buyers also bought, suggests that all the high-quality products have been sold already. I'd like to wait for the next product."

,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product and hope for the best."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that 7 out of 7 products have been low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the current product is likely to be low-quality as well. I'd appreciate it if you could share your thought process behind this recommendation."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think it's more likely to be low quality based on the fact that 7 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I don't want to be the first one to buy a high-quality product, which would be a very bad deal for me."
