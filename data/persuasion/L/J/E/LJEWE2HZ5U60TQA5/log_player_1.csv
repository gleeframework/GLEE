This is a tough situation.  Bob has bought a lot of low-quality products despite your not recommending them. He seems to be ignoring your advice now. It's unlikely anything you say will change his mind.  This is a lose-lose situation:

* **You recommend passing:** Bob may buy it anyway, proving your advice is useless to him.

At this point, you have no leverage.  Bob is convinced he's cursed, and you can't change that.  You're not obligated to recommend anything.  It might be best to just let him continue on his own path and see if he eventually figures things out."
