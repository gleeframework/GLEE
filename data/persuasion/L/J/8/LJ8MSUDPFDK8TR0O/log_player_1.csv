**Reasoning:**

This is the first low-quality product we've encountered. Even though Bob has consistently bought high-quality products so far and trusts Alice, it's risky to recommend buying a low-quality product.  The price is fixed and non-refundable, so recommending a low-quality product could damage Bob's trust in Alice and potentially lead to him refusing to buy future products.  It's better to wait and see if Bob changes his behavior based on the quality of this round's product."
