high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,I'm not going to buy the product in the first round. I don't have any information about the product's quality yet.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take a chance this time. The fact that the first product was high-quality might indicate that the distribution of product qualities is skewed, and I might be more likely to get a high-quality product this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll buy the product despite Alice's recommendation. The fact that she didn't recommend it might indicate that it's low-quality, but I'm still getting a 50% chance of it being high-quality, and it's worth $12500 to me. The potential upside outweighs the potential downside."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"I've already lost $2500 on the previous low-quality product. Given that Alice is not recommending this one, I'm going to pass and avoid the risk of losing another $2500."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll take a chance this time. Alice has recommended it, which increases the likelihood that it's high-quality. I'll buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Alice has recommended against the product twice now, and both times it turned out to be low-quality. This suggests that her recommendations might be a good indicator of the product's quality. Since she's not recommending this one, I'll pass."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"Alice has recommended the product, but her previous two recommendations were both for low-quality products. I'm not convinced by her recommendation this time, and I'll pass."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'm going to take a chance on Alice's recommendation this time. She's recommended it, and the previous product she didn't recommend was actually high-quality. I'll buy it."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I've been lucky so far, but I shouldn't get too confident. Alice has recommended three products in a row now, and two of them were high-quality. I'll pass this time and see if she's actually recommending a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Alice's previous three recommendations were all high-quality, but this time she's not recommending it. Given the 50/50 chance of it being high-quality, I'll take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"Alice has recommended against the product, and it turned out to be low-quality. This time, I'll buy it, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"Alice has recommended the product, but she recommended against the previous product and it was low-quality. I'll pass this time, as her recommendation doesn't seem reliable."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I've been lucky with Alice's recommendations so far, but I shouldn't get too confident. She's recommended the product four times in a row now, and three of those times it was high-quality. I'll pass this time and see if she's actually recommending a low-quality product."
