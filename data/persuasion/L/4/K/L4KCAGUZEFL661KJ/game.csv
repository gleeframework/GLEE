,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm not influenced by your recommendation, and I'm willing to take the chance of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not buying based on your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than the previous 2 buyers thought, since they both passed on it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than the 33.33% probability. Given the recommendation from Alice, I'm skeptical and would rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%, which would make it a bad deal for me. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, given the current statistics. I'm hesitant to buy without knowing the likelihood of getting a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have rejected the product, which suggests that the product is likely to be low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's reasonable to assume that the product I'm being offered is also low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous 4 buyers. This suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is relatively low. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the previous sales record or your expectation of the product's quality?
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers, including those who were recommended to buy, didn't find a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the low probability of this product being high quality given the statistics."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I suspect that the products are more likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. If you don't recommend it, it's likely to be a low-quality product, and I'd rather not waste my money."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 products have been low-quality so far, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is actually lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product."
