high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm only doing this to get the information that it's high or low quality. I'll make my decision based on the quality of the product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I already have a high-quality product, so I don't need another one. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll buy the product, because even though I already have one high-quality product, the probability of getting another high-quality product is still 80% and it's worth $30000 to me, which is a significant gain."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll buy the product, even though Alice doesn't recommend it. The probability of it being high-quality is still 80%, and if it is, it's worth $30000 to me, which is a good opportunity."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I already have two high-quality products, and I don't need another one. The probability of this product being high-quality is 80%, but the potential loss if it's low-quality is $10000, which is not worth the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll buy the product, even though Alice doesn't recommend it. The probability of it being high-quality is 80%, and if it is, it's worth $30000 to me, which is a significant gain."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"I already have three high-quality products, and I don't need another one. The probability of this product being high-quality is 80%, but the potential loss if it's low-quality is $10000, which is not worth the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'll buy the product, because I don't have any information about its quality yet. The probability of it being high-quality is 80%, and if it is, it's worth $30000 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I already have four high-quality products, and I don't need another one. The probability of this product being high-quality is 80%, but I'm already in a good position, so I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'll buy the product, because I don't have any information about its quality yet. The probability of it being high-quality is 80%, and if it is, it's worth $30000 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I already have five high-quality products, and I don't need another one. The probability of this product being high-quality is 80%, but I'm already in a good position, so I'll pass on this one."

,,Bob,12,yes,"I'll buy the product, because I don't have any information about its quality yet. The probability of it being high-quality is 80%, and if it is, it's worth $30000 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"I already have six high-quality products, and I don't need another one. The probability of this product being high-quality is 80%, but I'm already in a good position, so I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,"I already have seven high-quality products and one low-quality product. I'd rather avoid buying another product that could be low-quality, so I'll pass on this one."
