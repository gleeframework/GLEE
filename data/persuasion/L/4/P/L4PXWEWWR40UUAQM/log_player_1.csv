{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
 
Even though the product is high-quality, Bob has no reason to trust Alice.

It's better for Bob to continue to pass on the product until he sees more evidence of Alice's honesty."

Alice has a track record of recommending only low-quality products. Bob is losing trust in her judgment, and it's better for him to continue to pass on the products until he sees more evidence of Alice's honesty."
"Bob's message: Alice, I'm beginning to think you're intentionally trying to sell me low-quality items.  I've passed on several products now, and I've missed out on two high-quality ones. I'm going to continue passing until I see some evidence that you're being truthful about your recommendations.

{""decision"": ""no""}
