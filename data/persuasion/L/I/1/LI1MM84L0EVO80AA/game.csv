,,Alice,7,"Bob, I've been transparent with you from the start, and I want to be upfront with you now. I've already told you about the product's condition, and I've offered you a great deal. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll let you have this product for $7000, which is the lowest price I've ever offered it for.

,,Alice,17,"Bob, I'm glad you're willing to consider the standard model. However, I want to be upfront with you about this product. It's not as high-quality as the previous two products you purchased, and it may not meet your expectations. I'm willing to let you have it for $9000, which is the lowest price I've ever offered for this product. I'll also throw in a 2-year warranty, which is more than the standard warranty for this product. I want to be transparent with you, but I think this is a fair deal considering the product's limitations.",
,,Bob,17,"While I appreciate the transparency and the additional warranty, I believe it's crucial to invest in a product that meets my quality expectations.
