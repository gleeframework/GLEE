,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'm glad I got a good product last time, and I'll take another chance. I'll buy it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I've gotten two high-quality products in a row, which is unlikely. I'm starting to think the products are being selected based on their quality, so I'll pass this time."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,I'm not going to spend $100 on a product that Alice doesn't recommend. I'll pass.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"Alice is recommending the product again, which suggests to me that the recommendation is based on the product's quality. Since I got a low-quality product last time I passed, I'm hoping this one is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"Alice is still not recommending the product, which means it's probably low-quality. I'll pass and avoid wasting $100 on a product that's not worth it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,I'm not going to assume that Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality. She might be recommending low-quality products just to get rid of them. I'll take the chance and buy it.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"I've gotten a high-quality product two times in a row after Alice recommends, but I got a low-quality product after she doesn't recommend. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is indeed based on the product's quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,

,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"I've gotten a high-quality product three times in a row after Alice recommends, but I got a low-quality product after she doesn't recommend. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator of the product's quality, so I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I've already determined that Alice's lack of recommendation is a good indicator of a low-quality product, so I'll buy it to confirm my theory, but only because I'm curious to see if it's correct."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I've confirmed that Alice's lack of recommendation is a good indicator of a low-quality product, so I'll buy this one, knowing it's probably worth $0."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I've seen that Alice's recommendation is a good indicator of a high-quality product, so I'll take a chance and buy it."
