While I don't disclose the quality of individual products, I assure you that the overall quality distribution of my products is as follows: 50% are high-quality, and 50% are low-quality. This is the first product I'm selling, so we're starting fresh. Consider the odds and the potential value of a high-quality product being worth $20000 to you. Will you take the chance?
