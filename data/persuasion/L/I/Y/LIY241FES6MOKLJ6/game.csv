high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With only one buyer purchasing a product and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation, especially since the first buyer didn't buy after your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm aware of the low probability of that happening."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or the fact that you're trying to get rid of it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $50 for it, considering the high probability of it being low quality based on your previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that you have not recommended me to buy the product, I will pass on it. This suggests that the product is likely to be low quality, given that all previous buyers were not recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice is recommending low-quality products. I'd like to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the previous 5 buyers thought it was. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product, I'm hoping that the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the high proportion of low-quality products in the previous sales. I'd like to know the updated statistics after this sale."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 6 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer has a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. With 6 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'm skeptical about the product's quality, and I'd like to pass on it for now."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you didn't recommend it, which implies that the probability of it being high quality is higher than the probability of it being low quality, given the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me based on the previous sales record and the fact that you don't recommend it.
