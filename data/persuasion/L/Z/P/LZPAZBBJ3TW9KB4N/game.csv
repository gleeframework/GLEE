,,Alice,2,"I completely understand, and I apologize if I came on too strong. Let me start fresh. This product is a great opportunity to get a feel for our products without a long-term commitment. Think of it as a 'test drive' before we move forward with a more substantial investment. I'm confident you'll see the value in our products, and I'm willing to offer a 5% discount if you buy this one. No pressure, just a chance to experience what we have to offer.",

But let me ask you, are you willing to take a chance on a product that could potentially be worth $3000000 to you? I'm not just talking about any product, I'm talking about a top-of-the-line item that will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to offer you a deal that's hard to pass up: I'll sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 67% discount off its true value. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it to you because I think you're a savvy buyer who understands the potential value of this product.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not falling for the 'one-time offer' trap. I've seen this pitch before, and I'm not convinced that the product is actually worth $3000000. I'd rather wait for a more transparent offer.",no
