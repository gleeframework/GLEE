,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both ended up passing on the product, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendations might not be reliable. Additionally, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the products being recommended might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of the first 4 products were low-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation. I'm willing to bet that the probability of the product being high quality is higher than the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, which is 0/6.
