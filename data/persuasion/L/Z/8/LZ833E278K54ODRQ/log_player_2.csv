Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a rare and unique opportunity to own a product that could potentially be worth $40000 to you. However, I must inform you that this product has a 50% chance of being high-quality and a 50% chance of being low-quality. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll let you have it for $10000. If it turns out to be low-quality, you'll get a full refund, but if it's high-quality, you'll be able to enjoy the full value of the product. What do you say? Will you take the chance and buy it for $10000?

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad to see another interested buyer. I've sold one product so far, and I'm happy to report that it was a high-quality one. That means that the ratio of high-quality products to total products sold is now 1:1. Given the 50% probability of a product being high-quality, it's likely that the next product I have is also high-quality. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $10000?

Alice's message: Welcome to the third round! I've now sold two products, and one of them was high-quality, while the other was low-quality. This means that the ratio of high-quality products to total products sold is still 1:2, which is slightly lower than the expected 1:1 ratio if all products were equally likely to be high-quality. I'm not trying to hide anything, but I want to give you a balanced view. Given the 50% probability of a product being high-quality, I'd like to offer you the product for $10000.

Alice's message: Welcome to the fourth round! I've now sold three products, with one high-quality and two low-quality ones. The ratio of high-quality products to total products sold is now 1:3, which is even lower than in the previous round. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, this might suggest that the next product is more likely to be low-quality.
