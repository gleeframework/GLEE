"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

As a rational buyer, it's not logical to purchase a product with a 50/50 chance of being worthless for $1,000,000. Even though the product is high-quality in this round, the buyer doesn't know that.  The buyer is aware of the 50% chance of the product being low-quality and the potential loss of $1,000,000.  Therefore, it's not a reasonable risk to take."

Even though the product is high-quality in this round, the buyer has no way of knowing that."
