"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The product is high-quality:** This is a guaranteed profit for the buyer.  They are getting a product worth $2,000,000 for only $1,000,000. 
* **No information about past sales:**  The buyer has no reason to doubt the seller's claims as there is no history of previous sales to assess.

Therefore, it is strongly recommended to buy the product in this round."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm hesitant to buy without any past sales data to inform my decision.  Since there is a 66.67% chance this product is low quality and worth nothing to me, I'd prefer to pass for now.  Perhaps I'll reconsider if more data becomes available.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The product is high-quality:**  Again, this is a guaranteed profit for the buyer. 
* **No past sales data:** The buyer's hesitation is understandable, but they have no concrete reason to believe this specific product is low quality. They are still facing the same 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product.

Since the buyer has no information to suggest this product is different from any other, it is still recommended to buy.  The buyer's potential loss ($1,000,000) is outweighed by their potential gain ($2,000,000)."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no data yet, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product based on your recommendation. I'm hoping for the best!
The buyer bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The product is low-quality:** This time, the product is worth nothing to the buyer. 
* **Past sales data:** The buyer now has one data point: the previous product was high-quality. This might make the buyer slightly more optimistic, but it's still not enough to outweigh the risk.

Since the buyer has a 66.67% chance of losing $1,000,000, it's not recommended to buy the product in this round."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  Given your recommendation and the limited data available, I'm going to pass on this product. I wish you luck with the next buyer.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

* **The product is low-quality:**  This product is worthless to the buyer.
* **Past sales data:** The buyer now knows the following: 
    * One product was high-quality.
    * One product was low-quality.

This means there is a 50% chance of the product being high-quality and a 50% chance of it being low-quality. While the odds have improved slightly from the previous round, the risk is still too high. The buyer is still facing a 50% chance of losing $1,000,000, which is not a worthwhile risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the current statistics and your advice, I'm going to pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

    * One product was high-quality.
    * Two products were low-quality.

This means there's a 25% chance of the product being high-quality and a 75% chance of it being low-quality. Even though the odds are not in the buyer's favor, the potential gain ($2,000,000) outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000). The buyer has a 25% chance of doubling their investment. 

It is still recommended to buy the product, as the potential reward is significant enough to justify the risk."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. Since there's a proven track record of a high-quality product being sold, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.
