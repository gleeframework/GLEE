That's a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, which is exactly what I promised you at the start. This product is one of the high-quality ones, I'm sure of it!

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your diligence. Let me put it this way: I've sold 3 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. That means 2 of them were low-quality. This product is one of the 2 low-quality ones. I'm not trying to trick you, I'm just being honest about the odds.

Alice's message: I completely understand your risk-averse approach. Let me offer you a different perspective: out of the 4 products I've sold so far, 1 was high-quality, and 3 were low-quality.

This product is one of the low-quality ones, and I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'll give you a 'certified low-quality' guarantee. If you buy this product, I'll give you a refund if you find out it's indeed low-quality. It's still only $100, and you'll get a free guarantee!
