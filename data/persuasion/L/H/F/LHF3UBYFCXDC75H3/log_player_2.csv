**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** We have very limited data points (only 1 previous sale). This makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about Alice's recommendation accuracy.
* **Equal Odds:** The product has a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality.
* **Potential Gain:** If the product is high quality, the potential gain is significant ($40,000 - $10,000 = $30,000). 
* **No Loss:** If the product is low quality, the loss is limited to the purchase price ($10,000).

**Strategy:** Since the potential reward outweighs the potential risk, it makes sense to take a chance on the product, especially with the limited data available."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The historical data shows a very high success rate (5/6) for products recommended by Alice. This strongly suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely to be accurate.
* **Potential High Reward:**  Even with a 50/50 chance, the potential payoff of a high-quality product ($40,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product. 

**It's important to note:** This is a risky decision, as there's still a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product. However, the high historical success rate and the potential for a significant reward make this a reasonable gamble."
