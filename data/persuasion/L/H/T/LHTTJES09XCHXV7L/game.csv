high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware of the 80% chance of it being high quality and the 20% chance of it being low quality. I'm willing to take the risk.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far, I think it's possible that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than 80% and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 80% and I can potentially get a $30000 value for a low price of $10000."
