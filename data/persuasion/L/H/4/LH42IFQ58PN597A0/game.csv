,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality yet. I'd like to wait and see the outcome of the product's quality before making a decision."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the next product being high-quality?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. Since you recommended it, I'm assuming it's likely to be low quality, and I don't want to waste my $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyer didn't buy it and there's a high chance it's low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'd like to know the quality of the product, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the information that you didn't recommend it, which suggests the product might be low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and pay $10000 for it, despite the expected value being negative."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, and considering the high probability of a low-quality product (66.67%), I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Given that 3 buyers have passed and 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm curious to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that all previous products were low-quality, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product. If I pass, I think the probability of a high-quality product being left unsold would decrease, making it less likely for the next buyer to get a good deal."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively low. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 4 previous buyers didn't find it valuable enough to buy, and the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers passed on the product, and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems like the product is likely to be low-quality. I will also take into account Alice's recommendation, which is to not buy the product. I will pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is very low. I'll pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take the risk and hope it's a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, and based on the statistics, all previous buyers were also not recommended to buy, which makes me think that all previous products were low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
