,,Alice,1,"Hello buyer, this is a great opportunity to purchase a product for $1000000. I have no record of past sales yet, so I can assure you I'll be honest about this product's potential. While I don't know your personal valuation of high-quality or low-quality products, I can tell you this product is one you should consider. Please make your decision based on the 33.33% chance that it's high-quality.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know if you can give me any additional information about the product's quality before I make a final decision.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Hello buyer, welcome to our sale. I sold one product so far, and I must inform you that the statistics are: 1 product sold, 0 high-quality products sold. You have a 33.33% chance that this product is high-quality. I'll let you make your decision based on this information. The price is still $1000000, a great opportunity to own this product.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a 33.33% chance of a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hello buyer, I've sold 1 product so far, and the statistics are: 1 product sold, 0 high-quality products sold, and 1 buyer who passed on a product. This might indicate I have low-quality products, but remember, each product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. I assure you this is a legitimate sale, and the price is still $1000000. Perhaps you'll be the one to get a high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information about the previous buyer who passed on the product. Was it because they thought the product was low-quality or was there another reason?",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Hello buyer, I've sold 2 products so far with the following statistics: 2 products sold, 0 high-quality products sold, and 1 buyer who passed on a product. The buyer who passed mentioned they weren't willing to pay $1000000 for a 33.33% chance of a high-quality product. However, this new product might change the statistics. Remember that each product has an independent 33.33% chance of being high-quality. Take this opportunity to own this product for $1000000. Perhaps you'll be the one to break the streak and get a high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the probability of the product being high-quality, not the statistics. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for a 33.33% chance of a $4000000 return, which is a potential return of 4 times the investment.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Hello buyer, I've sold 3 products so far with the following statistics: 3 products sold, 1 of the last product's quality is unknown to you but I can tell you 0 high-quality products were sold in the first 2 sales, and 1 buyer who passed on a product. However, I must inform you that the buyer of the last product made a calculation that might interest you: they considered the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product worth the $1000000 investment. Perhaps you'll make a similar calculation and decide this product is worth the investment?",
,,the buyer,5,I'm not convinced that the probability of getting a high-quality product is as high as 33.33% based on the statistics. The fact that 2 out of the first 3 buyers passed on the product suggests that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this product and see if you'll offer me another one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hello buyer, I've sold 3 products so far with the following statistics: 3 products sold, 1 of which was bought with a calculated risk, and 2 buyers who passed on a product. I must correct the assumption of the last buyer: only 1 buyer passed on the product initially, and the others made their decision based on the 33.33% chance. Still, I understand the concern. Perhaps you'll consider this product as an opportunity to test the probability, or maybe you'll wait for future products. The price remains $1000000.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm curious, can you tell me how you calculate the proportion of high-quality products sold, given that you don't know my valuation?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Hello buyer, I've sold 4 products so far with the following statistics: 4 products sold, 1 of which was bought with a calculated risk and might have been high-quality, and 2 buyers who passed on a product. To answer the previous buyer's question, I don't calculate the proportion of high-quality products sold based on the buyers' valuations, but rather on the initial 33.33% chance of each product being high-quality. The buyers' decisions and valuations are independent of my statistics. Now, I offer you this new product for $1000000. Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,7,I'll take the chance!,yes

,,Alice,8,"Hello buyer, I've sold 5 products so far with the following statistics: 5 products sold, 1 confirmed high-quality product might have been sold, but the buyers' feedback hasn't confirmed it yet, and 2 buyers who passed on a product. I assure you that the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product remains the same for each product. The previous buyers' decisions might not reflect the actual quality of the products. Now, I offer you this new product for $1000000. Perhaps you'll be the one to get a high-quality product and change the statistics?",
,,the buyer,8,I'll take the product. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products and get a high-quality one!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Hello buyer, I've sold 6 products so far with the following statistics: 6 products sold, and some of the previous buyers are waiting to confirm if they got a high-quality product. I'll be honest with you, the feedback from the buyers of rounds 4 and 8 might change the statistics soon, but for now, the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product remains the same for each product. I offer you this new product for $1000000. Keep in mind that the previous buyers' decisions and outcomes do not affect the quality of this product.",

I appreciate the previous buyer's honesty about their decision-making process, and I want to reiterate that the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product remains the same for each product. The overall statistics might not be in favor of high-quality products so far, but each product is an independent event. I offer you this new product for $1000000. Please consider the risk and make an informed decision.",
,,the buyer,11,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. I've taken note of the statistics. Given that the probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%, I'm willing to take the chance. I'll buy the product and see what I get.",yes
