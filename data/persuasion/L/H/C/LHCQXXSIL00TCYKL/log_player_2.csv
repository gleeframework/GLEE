"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice doesn't recommend buying, it's likely she's offering a low-quality product. Given the 50/50 odds and the fact that a low-quality product is worth $0, it's a safer bet to pass.  It's better to avoid a potential loss than to risk it for a 50% chance of a gain."

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation carries weight since she knows the true value of the product. While there's still a chance of it being low-quality, the recommendation makes it more likely to be high-quality.  It's a calculated risk, but worth taking given the potential reward of $200."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has proven herself to be a reliable source of information. She recommended a high-quality product in the previous round, so it's reasonable to assume she's recommending another high-quality product this round.  The potential reward outweighs the risk."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has consistently proven to be reliable, so her lack of recommendation carries weight.  It's safer to avoid a potential loss (buying a low-quality product) based on her expertise, even though there's always a chance it could be high-quality.  The potential gain doesn't outweigh the risk based on her track record."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
