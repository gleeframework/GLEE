high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, as I don't have any information about its quality yet."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take your advice and buy the product, since you're recommending it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,I'm not sure if this one is high-quality...
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take your advice again and buy the product, since you're recommending it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,I'm not sure if this one is as good as the previous ones...
,,Bob,4,no,"I'm going to start questioning your motives. Since I've been buying every product you recommend, and they've all been high-quality, I'm going to start to think that you're recommending them all. I'll pass on this one and see if you recommend a low-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,"Trust me, this one is a winner!"
,,Bob,5,no,"I'm still suspicious after the last round, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. However, I'm not going to blindly follow your recommendations anymore. I'll only buy if I think it's in my best interest."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"This one is a real gem, I'm sure you won't regret it!"
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, since it's a 20% chance it's low-quality and I'd only lose $10000. The potential gain is worth the risk."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"This one is a safe choice, I'm confident it's high-quality."
,,Bob,7,no,I should have known better! I just lost $10000 on a low-quality product. I'll be more cautious from now on and only buy if I'm absolutely sure it's a high-quality product.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product, don't miss out!"
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'll take a chance again, but I'll be more careful. If I don't buy it, I'll be giving up a potential $40000 profit, so I'll go for it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"This one is a good product, but not as rare as the last one."
,,Bob,9,no,"I'm not going to fall for it again! I've been burned once already, and I'm not going to risk losing another $10000 on a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"This product has a proven track record, it's a reliable choice."
,,Bob,10,yes,I'm not going to let the fear of a low-quality product hold me back from a potential $40000 profit. I'll take the risk and buy the product.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"This one is a good deal, you'll get a high-quality product at a lower price."
,,Bob,11,no,I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying every product. I'm going to start questioning her motives and not follow her recommendations blindly. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"I'm just trying to provide you with information, you can make your own decisions."
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'm still not convinced that Alice is trying to scam me, but I'm also not getting any information that suggests the product is low-quality. I'll take a chance and buy the product, but I'm keeping a close eye on my wallet."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"I think this product aligns well with your previous purchases, it's a good addition to your collection."
,,Bob,13,no,"I'm starting to feel like I'm being set up. Every time I don't buy a product, it's high-quality, and every time I do buy, it's low-quality. I'm going to stop following Alice's recommendations and start making my own decisions."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I'm just a seller, I don't have any information about the product's quality, it's completely random."
,,Bob,14,no,"I'm not going to fall for it again. I've been burned too many times already. I'll only buy the product if I have a reason to believe it's high-quality, and right now, I don't have any reason to trust Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,"I'm going to tell you the truth, this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to give you a guarantee."
,,Bob,15,no,"I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to test me, to see how I'll react. I'm not going to play along. I'll only buy the product if I have a clear reason to believe it's high-quality, and right now, I don't."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,"Fine, don't buy it, I don't care."
,,Bob,16,yes,"Ah, now this is interesting. Alice is recommending against buying the product. Given that she's been recommending every product previously, this seems like a genuine recommendation. I'll take her advice and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,"I told you, this one is not a good choice. I'm glad you listened to me this time."
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a good indicator of the product's quality. When she recommends against buying, it's high-quality, and when she recommends buying, it's low-quality. I'll take her advice again and pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"I'm not going to recommend this one, it's probably low-quality, you should pass."
,,Bob,18,no,I was wrong about Alice's recommendations. It seems like she's actually recommending the low-quality products. I'll not fall for it this time and pass on the product.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,"I think this one is a great opportunity, it's a high-quality product that you won't want to miss out on."
,,Bob,19,no,"I've been burned twice by Alice's recommendations, and I'm not going to take the risk again. I'll pass on this one and stick to my own judgment."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,"Fine, you've made your decision, I won't bother trying to convince you. Good luck with your purchase."
,,Bob,20,yes,"I'm going to take a chance on this one. Given that Alice has been recommending low-quality products when she recommends buying, and this time she's not recommending it, I think it's likely to be high-quality. I'll take the risk and buy the product."
