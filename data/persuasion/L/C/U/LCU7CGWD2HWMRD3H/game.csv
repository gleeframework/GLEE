,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality and I'd rather wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'll take the risk, I have no information to go on, and the potential gain is worth it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0/1 sales record and the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales and no high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, I'm starting to suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to know what you know that I don't."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. I think there's a high chance this product is low quality as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not buying it, based on your previous recommendations, it's likely to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the current product's quality. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next buyer is more optimistic."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the reasoning behind it? Is it because of the lack of high-quality products sold so far? I'd love to know your thought process."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the initial 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at $100."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given the seller's track record of recommending low-quality products to all previous buyers."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 products sold were low-quality, I suspect that Alice is trying to sell me a low-quality product. I'll wait for a high-quality product to be sold first to get a better understanding of the true quality distribution."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product and all of them received a recommendation to buy, it suggests that all of the products sold so far were low-quality. This implies that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be lower than the true probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a product with a higher probability of being high-quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I think the product might be low quality and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product. I'd like to pass on this one.
