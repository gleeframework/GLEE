Are you willing to join me on this journey and potentially make a profit?",
,,Bob,10,"Alice, you're right about the sunk cost fallacy, but I'm not willing to throw away another $100 on a product that has a 50% chance of being low-quality. I've learned my lesson, and I'm not going to fall for it again. I'm out.",no
