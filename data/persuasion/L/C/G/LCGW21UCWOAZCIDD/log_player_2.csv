"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll pass on this one.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the product's true quality and she's not recommending it, there's a high probability it's low quality. It's not worth the risk of spending $100 on a product worth $0 to you."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks again for the advice. I'll pass on this one too.""}

Alice's continued lack of recommendation, even after confirming the previous product was low quality, reinforces the idea that this product is likely also low quality.  It's still not worth the risk."

```

**Reasoning:**
