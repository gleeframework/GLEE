This way, you'll at least get some compensation for your trouble, and you can still get a product at a very low price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the 'consolation prize'. The potential bonus of $10,000 is not enough to outweigh the risk of buying a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality, which would be worth $0 to me. I'd rather not take the risk.""}"

Round 8
Alice's message: I'm starting to think that I'm not being clear enough about the value of these products.

If it's high-quality, you'll get the full $2000000. Either way, you'll be ahead of the game. Is that a deal you're willing to take?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your attempt to simplify the deal, Alice, but the guarantee you're offering is essentially the expected value of the product, which is ($2000000 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $666,667. Your offer of $10,000 is still not enough to convince me to take the risk of buying a product with a 66.67% chance of being low-quality.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a chance on the 'lottery ticket'. If it's high-quality, I'll get a product worth $2,000,000, and if it's low-quality, I'll still get a high-quality product in the next round. The potential gain is worth the $50,000 cost.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Wait a minute, Alice.
