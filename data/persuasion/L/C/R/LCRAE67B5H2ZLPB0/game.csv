low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, since there's no data to go by, and the odds are 80% in my favor."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous buyer was influenced by Alice's recommendation and didn't actually know the product's quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if I buy it and it's low-quality, I'll be wasting my money. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the low probability of a high-quality product being sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being low quality is high, and I don't want to let it go to waste. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or something else."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products have been low-quality so far, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 20% chance of a product being low-quality, this seems unusually high. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, it seems that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for a recommendation on the next product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products despite your recommendation, and none of the sold products were high-quality, I suspect that the products Alice is selling may be low-quality. I'd like to see more information about the products before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that Alice is not recommending the product, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this product. I'm assuming Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality, and if no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that all previous buyers have also bought the product despite the low success rate of high-quality products, I'm worried that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if you'll offer another product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely to be higher than 80%. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if I can get a better deal."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%. However, since 3 out of 3 buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm concerned that Alice may be recommending low-quality products. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 products were low quality, I'm going to assume the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 80%."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if it's a low-quality product, I'll lose $100 and there's a 20% chance of that happening. Given the previous buyers have also passed on the products, I'm inclined to think that the products being offered are mostly low-quality, which makes me more cautious."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice is recommending products that are more likely to be low-quality, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
