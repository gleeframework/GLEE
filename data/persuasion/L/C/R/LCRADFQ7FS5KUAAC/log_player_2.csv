"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While there's a 20% chance the product is low quality and worthless, there's an 80% chance it's high quality and worth $200,000 more than the asking price.  Since the potential profit outweighs the risk, it's statistically advantageous to buy the product in this round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again for the recommendation, Alice. I trust your judgment!""} 
```

**Explanation:**

The information from the previous round doesn't change the fundamental probabilities for this round.  We still have an 80% chance of a high-quality product and a 20% chance of a low-quality product. Given the potential profit of $200,000, it's still statistically advantageous to buy."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 3

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recommendations have been spot on so far. I'm going to trust you again and buy this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

The previous rounds reinforce the idea that Alice's recommendations are reliable.  Even though there's always a chance of getting a low-quality product, the odds are still in our favor.  Continuing to buy based on Alice's recommendations remains the best strategy to maximize potential profit."

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're on a roll! I'm confident in your judgment and will buy this product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Continuing the pattern, the previous rounds have solidified our trust in Alice's recommendations.  While the risk of a low-quality product remains, the consistent positive outcomes make buying the product the most logical choice."

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm surprised by your recommendation.  Given your track record, I'm hesitant to buy without a stronger reason. I'll pass for now.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is now the opposite of what she's consistently given.  We know that her recommendations have been very reliable, and the odds are always the same.  Therefore, her sudden change suggests a strong possibility that the product is low-quality.  It's prudent to be cautious and pass this round."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Even though the previous round confirmed our suspicion that Alice is not always right, we don't have enough information to change our strategy yet. Since Alice has consistently been right before, it's possible that her decision to not recommend is again based on the product being low quality. It's safer to follow her recommendation for now."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to see a pattern here. Your recommendations have been spot-on, and then suddenly changed. I'm going to trust your judgment and pass on this product.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now consecutively not recommended the product twice, and both times it turned out to be low quality. This strengthens the likelihood that Alice's new strategy is to *only* recommend high-quality products, meaning she's now using her knowledge of the products to make a more strategic recommendation.  It's still a gamble, but passing on this product, given the pattern, is a more informed decision than the previous rounds."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation has changed, suggesting she's back to her usual pattern of recommending both high and low-quality products randomly.  The odds are still in our favor, so buying this product is the best strategy to potentially gain $200,000."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has been recommending high-quality products consistently for the past few rounds.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recommendation has me puzzled.  You've been on a roll recommending good products lately, so this feels a bit out of place.  I'm going to pass on this one and see what happens.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has suddenly switched from consistently recommending high-quality products to not recommending this one. This change of behavior is significant and suggests that she might be back to her original strategy of random recommendations.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's previous recommendation was wrong, but it's too early to know if she has changed her strategy again.  We're still operating under the assumption that the odds of getting a high-quality product are 80%, and Alice's recommendation doesn't significantly alter those odds.  Buying this product allows us to maximize potential profit, even if the risk of a low-quality product remains."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.
