,,Alice,1,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on your past recommendations, but I'm curious, is there a pattern or reason behind your recommendations?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%, and the potential gain of $20000 if it is."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, and I think this might be a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get a better deal since I'm taking a risk."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's high quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not buying based on your previous recommendations to other buyers. If you're not recommending it, I'm inclined to think it's low quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 6 buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer is willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the previous 6 products were likely low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's possible that the next product could be high-quality. However, given the low success rate of the previous buyers, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for more information or a better opportunity."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that you recommended it suggests it's likely to be a low-quality product, and I don't want to risk wasting $10000 on something that's not worth it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the sales record, or is there something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have received a recommendation from Alice to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, it seems like Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but given the fact that 6 previous buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the previous 6 buyers were all low-quality products and you wouldn't recommend a high-quality product to someone who has a history of buying low-quality products. This is a very weak reasoning, but I'm hoping to be the lucky one!"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows 7 buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the seller may be selecting low-quality products for the buyers who purchase. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
