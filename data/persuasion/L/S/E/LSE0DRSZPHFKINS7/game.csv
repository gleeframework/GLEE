high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to decline the product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and chose to do so, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, it suggests that the first buyer might have been sold a low-quality product. This makes me more cautious, and I'd like to pass on this opportunity."

,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there's a 50% chance it's high quality, and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling high-quality products to the first two buyers, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when I could potentially lose the entire amount."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, which makes me think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that Alice may be biased towards recommending low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
