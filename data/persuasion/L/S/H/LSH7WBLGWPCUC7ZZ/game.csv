high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any prior information to go on. I'm essentially taking a wild guess."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the updated statistics after my decision, and I'd like to ask, what is the probability that the product I'm being offered is high-quality, based on the previous sale?"

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm curious to see if it's high quality or low quality. Can you please reveal its quality after I make my decision?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a recommendation based on the updated statistics after my decision is revealed.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending it, and I'll consider that in my decision"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you recommended it, and I know that 2 out of the previous 2 products were high quality. I'm hoping for a 100% success rate!"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 products sold so far were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the next product being low-quality is higher than the overall probability, which is 20%. I'd rather wait and see if the next product has a higher probability of being high-quality based on the updated statistics."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the product and all of them received high-quality products, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered has increased. I'd like to wait for a low-quality product to be offered, which is more likely to be the case given the low probability of a low-quality product being sold in the first 3 instances."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because you think it's low-quality?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 4 buyers bought the product recommended by you, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the overall average. However, I'm not convinced that this is a high-quality product, and I'd like to wait for the next product to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase. Can you provide me with the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on her limited information and may not accurately reflect the product's quality. With only 3 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, it's possible that the next product could be low quality, and I don't want to risk losing $100. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
