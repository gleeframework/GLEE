,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that there's a 66.67% chance of it being low quality. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me why you don't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the previous buyer's purchase is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation doesn't give me much confidence in the product's quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the fact that none of the previous two products were high-quality and your recommendation is not based on any information about the product's quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the current statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/2, which is 0%. I'm concerned that the product might be low quality, and I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to ask, can you share the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 2 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the current product being high-quality is low. I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased against high-quality products. With a 66.67% chance of low-quality products, it's possible that a high-quality product is being hidden. I'm taking a chance!"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have received low-quality products, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $400 to me. I'd rather wait and see if the statistics change in my favor."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics. I'd like to pass on the product.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 4 purchases, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this product to get a better understanding of the actual quality distribution."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the seller's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous buyers received a high-quality product, suggesting a high likelihood of low-quality products being sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product, considering the previous sales record shows 0 high-quality products sold out of 4. Is it because the probability of a high-quality product is too low based on the current data?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I think the probability of getting a high-quality product is low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I don't want to buy this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low quality. I'd rather pass and let the next buyer decide."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the current sales record. With 5 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'm inclined to pass on the product and see if the next buyer will take it."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."
