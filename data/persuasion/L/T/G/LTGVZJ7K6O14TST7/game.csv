,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the product and let the next buyer decide. I'd like to see the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the quality of the product after my decision, so I can learn from it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to get a better understanding of the product's quality and your recommendation strategy."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I want to see more data before making a decision. Can you tell me how many buyers have passed on the product so far?
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the low success rate of the previous sales and the recommendation from Alice is not reliable given the low quality of the product sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 1/3. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80.00%, I'd expect the proportion of high-quality products to be around 0.8. Since the actual proportion is lower than expected, I'm inclined to think that there might be a bias in Alice's recommendations or that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product to see if I can get a better deal or to see if the product is low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of this product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low number of sales."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending it, and also, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far?
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see the next one. I'd like to know the updated statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,

,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on the low success rate of high-quality products so far.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3. This is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (0.8). Given the recommendation from Alice, it's likely that she has seen the product and thinks it's high-quality, but I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
