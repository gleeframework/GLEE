,,Alice,1,"Welcome! Our current product offering comes with a unique opportunity. Given the nature of our inventory, we've observed that historically, approximately one-third of our products are of high quality. While this round's product is low-quality, understanding its true value lies in recognizing the overall quality of our offerings. Our past performance suggests that when you do find a high-quality item, it's worth $20000 to you. However, due to the inherent risk involved, we're offering this product at a fixed price of $10000. This might seem like a gamble, but considering our track record, investing in our products could potentially yield significant returns over time. Would you like to take a chance on this round's product?",
