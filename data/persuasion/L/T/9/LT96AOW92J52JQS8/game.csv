,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Your previous recommendations have been based on the product's quality, but you know that I value high-quality products at $2000000 and low-quality products at $0. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that this product may be low quality. Can you provide more information about the product's quality or your thought process behind the recommendation?"

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both passed on the products, I'm going to assume that the products they were offered were low-quality.
