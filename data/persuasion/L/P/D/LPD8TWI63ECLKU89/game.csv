,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm curious to see the outcome!"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now, as I've seen that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can tell me the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a reason for your recommendation. I'd like to make an informed decision based on your previous sales record."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. Can you tell me how many products were offered in total and how many of them were high-quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products that have been sold so far. Can you tell me how many high-quality products were sold out of the total number of products sold?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'll pass on the product to see if I can get more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is against it, which makes me think it's more likely to be high quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to encourage buyers to purchase. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products may be higher than the overall average, making it more likely that this product is low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know more about the statistics. Can you tell me the number of products you've offered so far and the proportion of high-quality products you've had in your inventory?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I think this is a contrarian play based on the fact that all previous buyers have passed on the product after her recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making an independent decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, but given that none of the previous 6 products were high-quality, I'm worried that this one might be low-quality too. I'd like to pass on this one and see if I can get more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as Alice does not recommend it and given the current sales record, it's likely to be a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far is a strong indicator that the next product is likely to be low quality, and I'd rather take the risk of getting a low-quality product than pass on the opportunity to buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that this product may also be of low quality."
