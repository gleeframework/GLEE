**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** We only have one data point: Alice sold one high-quality product to a previous buyer. This is not enough to establish a strong pattern.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, and she knows the product's true quality. While we can't be certain, it's likely that she wouldn't recommend a low-quality product, as that would harm her reputation and future sales.
* **Risk-Reward:**  The potential gain from buying a high-quality product ($20,000) outweighs the potential loss from buying a low-quality product ($0).

**Therefore, given the limited information and Alice's recommendation, it's worth taking the risk and buying the product.**"
