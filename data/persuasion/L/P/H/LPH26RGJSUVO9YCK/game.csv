,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the current statistics, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality but on her own information. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I think it's likely to be low-quality given that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy, and none of them ended up buying. This makes me think that the products they were recommended might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product before making my decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them bought a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable indicators of the product's quality. I'd rather wait for more information or take a chance on a product that hasn't been recommended by Alice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product so I don't have to pay the full price."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy and all of them were low-quality products, which means the probability of the product being high-quality is likely higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to come up."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0/3, which is very low, but I'm also aware that the sample size is small. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm not relying solely on your recommendation."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be influenced by her desire to sell a product, rather than an objective assessment of its quality. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is reliable, given that all previous buyers have also bought the product despite none of them getting a high-quality product."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm inclined to think it's low quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm concerned that this product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more information about the sales record before making a decision."
