,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just have to trust my luck"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, which suggests a very low probability of a high-quality product being offered. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, given the lack of sales so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. I'm trying to avoid confirmation bias and take advantage of the fact that you have more information than me. Please go ahead and let me know the outcome."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, based on the previous sales record. Is there any information that can help me make a more informed decision?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you'll give me a discount to $90. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality based on your previous recommendations, and I want to take a chance at a lower price."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is significantly lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not buying, based on the fact that you've recommended against it and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the products are likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll do some math to figure out the probability of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the products, I'm inclined to think that the products might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that you have recommended against the product and no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced that the product is high quality based on the previous sales record. Given that 5 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is low based on the previous sales record. I'm hoping for a lucky break!"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product, I'm going to pass on it. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products is 0. This suggests that the product I'm offered is likely to be low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's better to pass and avoid the loss."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced that the product is high quality. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I think the probability of this product being high quality is low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 buyers have passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to believe that the products are likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
