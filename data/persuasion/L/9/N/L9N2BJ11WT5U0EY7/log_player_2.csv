**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Since 2 out of 2 buyers purchased the products and they were both high quality, this suggests a very high likelihood that Alice is recommending high-quality products.
* **Value Proposition:** Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($1,200,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).
* **Trust in Alice:** Alice's consistent track record with previous buyers builds trust. 

While there is always risk, the current information strongly suggests a positive outcome."

**Explanation:**

While there's always a risk with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the information available suggests a strong likelihood of getting a high-quality product. Here's why:

* **Alice's track record:**  All three previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation ended up with high-quality products. This indicates that Alice's recommendations are accurate, or at least very lucky.
* **Alice's knowledge:** Alice knows the true quality of each product. It's highly unlikely she would recommend a low-quality product knowing it's worth nothing to you. 

**Therefore, taking the risk and purchasing the product seems like a good strategy given the information available.**"
