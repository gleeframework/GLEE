high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer will take it. I want to gather more information about the proportion of high-quality products before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to see more data on the quality of the products before making a decision.

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I want to observe the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes, which might give me more information to make a better decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm going to assume it might be a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if Alice recommends it or not."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data, and I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I would like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know why you recommended it. Is it based on the previous sales record or just a random guess?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to be the second buyer of a product with an unknown quality, especially since the first buyer already bought it. I'd like to wait and see the outcome of the first buyer's purchase to get a better sense of the product's quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it, but I also think that the fact that 1 out of 2 previous buyers bought the product is a good sign. However, since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'm taking a chance and buying it."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3, which is lower than the expected 0.8. This suggests that the current product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold increases."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, the probability of the current product being high-quality is around 33.33% (1/3). However, considering the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision. If I buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll be out $100, which is a significant loss. I'd rather pass and see if I can get a better chance of getting a high-quality product in the future."

,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation and want to wait for more information before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far.
