"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you don't know the quality of the product, and Alice is recommending it, it's worth taking a chance. Even though there's a higher chance of it being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($200) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).  It's a gamble, but in this scenario, it makes sense to go for it."

Round 2

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the information, Alice.  I'll pass on this one. I'm not sure why you didn't recommend it, but I'll trust your judgment.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable piece of information. Since she doesn't know the true value of the product, her recommendation is based on some unknown factor.  Given that she didn't recommend the product this time, it's safer to assume it's likely low quality, even though there is still a chance it could be high quality. It's better to err on the side of caution and pass, especially since you already made a profit in the previous round."
