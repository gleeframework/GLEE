My track record is impressive, but it's not a guarantee. In fact, I'm starting to think that the next product might be a bit of a wild card.

But I'm excited to offer you this next product, which I'm confident is a great opportunity. It's a one-time deal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase. The price is $100, a small price to pay for a potentially great product.",
