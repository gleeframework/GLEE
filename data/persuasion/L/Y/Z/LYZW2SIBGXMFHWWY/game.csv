high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that I'm making a decision based on your recommendation without any prior sales data."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, which might have biased the recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 products, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass and see the next product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%, but since one high-quality product has already been sold, it's likely that there are more high-quality products left in the pool. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the first product sold was high-quality, but I think the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable given the low number of sales and the fact that she doesn't know my valuation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2, which is lower than expected. I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or not, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to see more data on the quality of the products sold before making a decision"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm not sure if you're considering the probability of the product being high-quality or not. I'd like to take the chance."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that she has already sold one high-quality product, and she may be trying to keep the proportion of high-quality products sold high to attract more buyers. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if I can get a better sense of the true quality distribution."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to ask you to share the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, I think there's a higher chance that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm a rational buyer, and I need to make my own decision based on the probabilities."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the previous sales record, I've only seen one high-quality product out of four sold, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm trying to learn from your previous sales record, and I'm aware of the 1 high-quality product sold out of 4 purchases. However, I'd like to buy this product to see its quality for myself."
