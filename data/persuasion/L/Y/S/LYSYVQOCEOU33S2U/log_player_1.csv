However, I want to highlight that you've now had two opportunities to purchase a product at the same price, and both times, you've chosen not to. I'm starting to wonder if you're missing out on a great opportunity. Let me ask you, what's the minimum value you'd need to see in a product to justify a purchase at this price point? Is it the features, the brand reputation, or something else? Help me understand your thought process, and I'll do my best to address your concerns.""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to understand my thought process. To be honest, I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1000000 to me, even with its high quality.
