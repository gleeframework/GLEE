Alice's message: We've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products so far, which means the ratio of high-quality to total products is 100%! You can see that our initial confidence in the product quality was not unfounded. We're now at 3 total products sold, and the probability of this product being high-quality remains 80%. However, we want to point out that the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually 20% lower than the overall probability, since we've already sold 2 high-quality products. We're still offering it to you for $10000. What are your thoughts?

Alice's message: We've now sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products, which means the ratio of high-quality to total products is still 100%! However, we want to caution you that this is an unusually high ratio, and it's possible that we're just getting lucky. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, but we want to give you a more nuanced view of the situation. We've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, but we've only sold 3 total products. If we were to sell 1 more high-quality product, the ratio would be 66.7%, which is still a significant advantage. But if we were to sell a low-quality product, the ratio would be 33.3%, which is more in line with the overall probability. We're still offering it to you for $10000. What are your thoughts?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: We've now sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 total products, which means the ratio of high-quality to total products is still 100%! However, we want to emphasize that this is an extremely unusual streak, and it's likely that we're due for a low-quality product soon. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, but we want to highlight that the law of large numbers is starting to come into play. If we were to sell 5 high-quality products in a row, the ratio would be 100% again, but the probability of this happening would be much lower than 80%. We're still offering it to you for $10000.

We're starting to get a little worried that we're not being transparent enough. Let's be real: it's highly unlikely that every single product we've sold so far is high-quality. We're not saying it's impossible, but it's definitely not the norm.
