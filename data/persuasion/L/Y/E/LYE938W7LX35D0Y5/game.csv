However, I still believe it has some value, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, the same price as the previous high-quality product. Think about it, Bob - you're essentially getting a free high-quality product, and you're paying the same price for a product that's still useful, even if it's not as good. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",

If so, then I'd like to offer you a deal. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $5000, the same price I offered it to you in Round 3. If you're not willing to pay that price, then I'll sell it to you for $7500, which is the price I offered the high-quality product in Round 4. Which option sounds more appealing to you?",

,,Alice,9,"Congratulations on making another great decision, Bob! I'm glad you're happy with your purchase.
