high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to see the outcome of the next product to get a better idea of the proportion of high-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as there's no prior data to influence my decision. I'm taking a neutral stance and hoping for the best."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I understand that you don't know my valuation, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and would like to wait for more information."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the recommendation might be biased towards selling, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products being offered. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality, and no high-quality products were sold. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, it's more likely that the product is low quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that if it's low quality, I'll be wasting $1000000, and if it's high quality, I'll be missing out on a potential $2000000 gain. Since Alice doesn't recommend it, I'll err on the side of caution and pass."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 2 buyers who bought the products didn't get high-quality ones. This suggests the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'm not convinced that this product is worth the $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see for myself if the product is high-quality or low-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that since all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, it's likely that the products are low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, because I'm trying to make a data-driven decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the statistics or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'll make my decision based on the statistics. With 4 out of 4 products being low quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high quality is actually 0.5, and I'll buy it."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm skeptical about Alice's recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales?"

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product, I'm concerned that this product might be low-quality as well. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
