,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, I'm the first one, and I don't have any information to go by, so I'll just have to rely on the probability of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the fact that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't suggests the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to pass on this product."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to decline the offer based on the fact that none of the previous products were high-quality, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers didn't buy the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information or a better opportunity."
