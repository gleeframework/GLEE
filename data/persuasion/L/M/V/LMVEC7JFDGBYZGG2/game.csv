,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to be transparent with you. The product is a new release, and it's still in the process of being refined.

,,Bob,5,"Alice, I understand the appeal of owning a limited edition product, but I still need more information about its quality.

,,Bob,7,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to share the reviews and offer a free accessory.
