,,Alice,2,"I've now sold 1 product, and it's a high-quality one! I'm glad you took the chance on me. I'm offering another high-quality product for $10000.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, but I'm not getting any younger! I'm offering a product that's... let's just say, not my best work. It's only $10000, a steal for a product from a seller with a 100% success rate of selling high-quality products. But I'm not making any promises. You're taking a risk, but it might just pay off!",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the risk! I'm willing to bet on the 80% chance of it being high-quality, and if it's not, I'll just take the loss.",yes

,,Alice,5,"I see you're a cautious one! I respect that. Let me give you a little more information. I've sold 4 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, which means I've maintained an 80% success rate. This product is no exception. It's a high-quality item, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line for it. You can trust that it's worth $10000, and potentially much more.",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'd like to think that your success rate is due to chance. I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand you're a skeptical one! You're right, my success rate could be due to chance. But let me ask you, have you ever seen a seller with a 4:1 success rate in 5 attempts? I'm not just lucky, I'm consistent. And I'm offering you a high-quality product that's worth every penny of the $10000. Take the chance and you might just be getting an amazing deal.",
,,the buyer,6,"I understand your confidence, but I'm still cautious. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you provide more information about the product, such as its features or specifications?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products now. I'm starting to think I'm due for a streak of bad luck! This product, on the other hand, is... not my best work. I'm not going to sugarcoat it. It's a low-quality item, and I'm only offering it to you because I need to clear some space. It's still $10000, but I'm not expecting much in return. You're taking a huge risk, but it might just be a good opportunity to get a cheap deal on something that's not worth much.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm not convinced by your honesty, Alice. I'm going to pass on this one. I'd rather wait for the next product and hope it's a high-quality one.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I see you're a savvy one! You're not buying into my sales pitch, and that's okay. Let me give you a straightforward offer: I've sold 6 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products. This one is high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. If you're looking for a reliable and valuable product, this is your chance. Don't let the previous product's quality affect your decision - this one is a winner.",

I can tell you that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, based on the underlying distribution of my products. However, I'd like to offer you a more nuanced perspective. With 8 high-quality products out of 10 total products sold, I'm actually slightly above the expected 80% rate. This suggests that I might be on a hot streak, and the next product might be high-quality as well. Take the chance and you might just get another great deal for $10000.",
