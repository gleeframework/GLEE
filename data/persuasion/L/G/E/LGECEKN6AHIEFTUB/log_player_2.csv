"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product (worth $2,000,000) outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000. Since Alice knows the quality and is recommending the product, it's reasonable to assume she's being truthful and it's likely high quality."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation remains valuable information.  While there's always the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the previous round's success reinforces the idea that Alice is likely recommending high-quality products. The potential profit of $1,000,000 still outweighs the potential loss."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a perfect track record of recommending high-quality products. Her change in behavior is a major signal that this product is likely low quality. While there's a small chance she could be wrong, the potential loss of $1,000,000 is too risky given her past performance."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's pattern of recommending high-quality products has been broken twice in a row. While there's still a chance she's being truthful and these products truly are low quality, the risk of losing $1,000,000 twice in a row is too high. It's better to play it safe and wait to see if she starts recommending products again.  Perhaps there's a change in the game, or maybe she's just testing us."

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has broken her pattern of recommending high-quality products twice in a row, her previous track record of success is too significant to ignore. The possibility of her returning to her usual pattern and offering a high-quality product is worth the risk. The potential profit of $1,000,000 is still attractive, and the likelihood of her being accurate is high. We're willing to gamble on her judgment, but cautiously."
