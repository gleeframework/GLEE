Alice's message: Hello! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. As a trusted seller, I assure you that the probability of this product being high-quality is 80%, as you already know. I've had no previous sales, so this is a fresh start! Given the potential value of $3000000 for a high-quality product, I believe the risk is worth taking, especially at the fixed price of $1000000. Take the chance to be the first to experience the quality I have to offer!
