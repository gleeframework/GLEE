I'd estimate it to be around 67%. However, I want to emphasize that this is still an estimate and not a guarantee. The price remains the same at $10000.

The probability of a product being low-quality is 25%. Considering this updated information, I'd like to offer you a product at the same price of $10000.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product. However, I'd like to know the expected value of buying the product. If the product is high-quality, I'll get a value of $12500. If it's low-quality, I'll get a value of $0. Given the updated probability of 75% for high-quality and 25% for low-quality, my expected value is ($12500 * 0.75) + ($0 * 0.25) = $9375. I'm willing to pay up to $10000 for a product with an expected value of $9375. Therefore, I'm willing to buy the product at the given price.
