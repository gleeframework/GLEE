low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 2 out of 2 previous buyers didn't buy it, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, considering Alice's recommendation is to buy, I'm concerned that she might be trying to manipulate me. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer is more cautious."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality and the expected value of buying it before making a final decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 buyers who received a recommendation to buy the product from you actually bought it, but none of them got a high-quality product. This means that the probability of a product being high quality given a recommendation to buy is 0. This is lower than the overall probability of a product being high quality (80%). I will pass on the product."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
