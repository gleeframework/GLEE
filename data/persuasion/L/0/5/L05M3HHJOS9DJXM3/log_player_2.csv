"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice knows the quality of the product, we don't. Since the product has an 80% chance of being high quality, it's statistically advantageous to buy. Even if it's low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality one in this scenario."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, why are you not recommending this product?  Is there something wrong with it?""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a significant piece of information. Since she knows the product's quality, her lack of recommendation suggests a high probability of it being low quality. While there's still a chance it's high quality, the risk is too high compared to the previous round.  We need more information before making a decision."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record is now 1 for 1 (one good recommendation, one bad). Even though her last recommendation was incorrect, it's important to remember that this is a game of probabilities. The product still has an 80% chance of being high-quality. Her recommendation provides additional information, though not conclusive, that increases our odds of getting a good product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Round 4

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a strong track record now, with three good recommendations in a row. Her lack of recommendation is a significant signal, suggesting a high probability of a low-quality product.
