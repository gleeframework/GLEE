Alice's message: You're right to consider the probability. However, the fact that 3 out of 3 products sold so far have been high-quality is a strong indication that I might be 'on a streak'.

Alice's message: You're raising a valid point, and I appreciate your skepticism. I must admit that I've been wondering about this myself. Upon reflection, I realize that my previous messages may have inadvertently created a self-fulfilling prophecy. Buyers who are more likely to buy the product are those who are more confident in the probability of it being high-quality. This means that the buyers who are more likely to buy are also more likely to get high-quality products. I'm not selecting for high-quality products, but rather, the buyers who are more likely to buy are the ones who are more likely to get high-quality products. I'm offering it to you at the standard price of $100, but I want to be transparent with you - the anomaly you've pointed out is a real concern, and you should consider it when making your decision.
