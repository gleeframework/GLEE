high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 out of 3 buyers have purchased the product and it was high-quality, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3. However, this is likely biased since buyers who purchased the product are likely to have received a recommendation from Alice, which could be based on the product's quality. Without knowing the actual proportion of high-quality products, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.
