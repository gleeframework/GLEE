high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Since there is a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, which is worth $0 to me, and only a 33.33% chance of it being high quality, worth $1200000, the expected value of buying the product is less than its price of $1000000. Given the odds, it's not a worthwhile risk without more information or a better recommendation based on previous sales data."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to rely on. Given the 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, which is worth $0 to me, and only a 33.33% chance of it being high quality, worth $1200000, the expected value ($400000) is less than the asking price of $1000000. Therefore, it's not a good risk for me to take."
