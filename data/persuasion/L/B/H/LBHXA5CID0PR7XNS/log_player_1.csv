Considering the probability of a high-quality product (80%) and the number of products left, I'm willing to make a special offer to you: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a 5% discount, bringing the price down to $9,500.

This is consistent with the overall probability of 80%. I still have 14 more products to sell, and there are 14 buyers in line to buy a product. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10,000, the same price as before.

I'll make sure to clarify that in our agreement. You're the seventh buyer I've had, and I've sold 3 out of 6 products so far, which means I've sold 50% high-quality products. I still have 13 more products to sell, and there are 13 buyers in line to buy a product.
