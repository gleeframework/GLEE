,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy, which might indicate a low-quality product, but I'm willing to take the risk since I'm the second buyer and there's still a 50% chance it's high quality."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced that it's a high-quality product based on the low success rate of previous buyers.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
