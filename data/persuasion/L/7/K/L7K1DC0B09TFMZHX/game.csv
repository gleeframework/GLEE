,,Alice,1,yes,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'm not sure if the first buyer's purchase was a high-quality product or a low-quality product. I'd like to know the outcome of the first transaction before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product before making a decision. Was it a high-quality product that they purchased?

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision on my own. Can I see the product before making a purchase?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't trust your recommendation and I want to see if I can get a high-quality product. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share that with me?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyers' experiences before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'm concerned that the recommendation might be biased towards encouraging me to buy, especially since I'm the third buyer and only one high-quality product has been sold so far."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have enough information about its quality. I'd like to know more about the previous buyers' experiences before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know how you arrived at the recommendation. Is it based on the number of high-quality products sold so far, or is there another factor at play?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is not to buy it. I'm trying to exploit the information that she has more information than me and is trying to manipulate me into not buying it, which makes me suspicious and want to buy it instead."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is based on a limited sample size and I'm making this decision based on my own analysis of the data. I'd like to know if you can tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 high-quality products were sold out of 4, I'm not confident that this product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the previous buyers were just lucky with the high-quality products. I'd like to wait and see if the proportion of high-quality products sold holds up as more buyers are presented.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, I'll pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but I'd like to make an informed decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/4 = 0.5. If the proportion of high-quality products is 50%, I would expect to see more than 2 high-quality products sold in 4 attempts. I'm going to take a chance and pass on the current product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the reason behind it. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product or because you're trying to reserve it for someone else?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'm not convinced by your recommendation."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she has sold 2 high-quality products so far, so she might be more likely to recommend high-quality products to buyers who have already seen these sales records. I'd like to wait and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality. With only 2 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0.5. This is not significantly different from the expected probability of 0.5. I'd like to wait and see if Alice's recommendation changes before making a decision."
