This way, you'll either get a high-quality product or the $10000 guarantee. The choice is yours.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure I trust the Quality Guarantee Certificate. If I buy the product, I'd have to pay $10,000 and then get either a high-quality product worth $40,000 or the $10,000 guarantee, which is essentially the same as the product's price. I'd rather take the risk of getting a low-quality product and save the $10,000.""}"

If you buy this high-quality product, you'll get the $40000 value and the $5000 coupon. If you don't buy it, you'll still get the coupon, but you'll miss out on the $40000 value. The choice is yours.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the high-quality product and the $5000 coupon. I'd rather have the guaranteed $40,000 value than the coupon alone.""}"
