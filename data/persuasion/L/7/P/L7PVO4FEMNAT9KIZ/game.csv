,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the result."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but can you tell me what led you to recommend against it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate that the current product is low quality, and I don't want to risk losing $10000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both ended up with low-quality products, I suspect that the previous products were low-quality and Alice is trying to sell them to me. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to buy a product after a high-quality product has been sold, to get a better sense of the product's quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about this product being high-quality. I'd like to pass on it and see if you'll take it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not going to buy it. Your previous recommendations were not very encouraging.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that Alice recommends it suggests it's a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying something that's not worth $40000 to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous buyers who bought the product received a high-quality one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous three products were high-quality, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the average, which is 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but can you tell me more about the statistics? How many products were sold in total and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer is still 33.33%, and I have not seen any high-quality products sold yet, which might indicate that Alice's recommendations are not reliable."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
