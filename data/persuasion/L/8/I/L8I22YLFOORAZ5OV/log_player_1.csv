"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I know this product is high-quality. Since Bob knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, he has no reason to suspect this product is any different. Therefore, I recommend Bob to buy the product.  While Bob doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, the 50% chance of it being high-quality is enough to make buying a reasonable decision."

Even though Bob bought a high-quality product in the previous round, he still doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product for him. He only knows the probability of a product being high-quality.  

Therefore, since this round's product is also high-quality, I still recommend Bob to buy it.  He has the same 50% chance of getting a high-quality product as he did in the previous round."

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation.  While Bob doesn't know the quality of the product, I do. As a seller, my goal is to maximize my profit. Recommending a low-quality product would be dishonest and could potentially damage my reputation with Bob in the future. 

It's better to be upfront about the product's quality and not recommend the purchase this time. While this might mean losing a sale, it could lead to a more sustainable and trusting relationship with Bob in the long run."
