Round 6
Alice's message: I've had enough of these lowball offers, Bob. This is my last chance to make you an offer. I'll give you a deal that's so good, it's almost crazy: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $100, and I'll throw in a second, identical high-quality product absolutely free. That's right, you'll get two top-notch products for the price of one. Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand you're not interested in the two-for-one deal. Let me make it simple and straightforward: I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $50, not $100.

That way, you can make an informed decision without any risk. The price remains the same: $50.

Round 9
Alice's message: I know you're a savvy buyer, Bob. I'll be upfront with you - this product isn't one of our top-of-the-line models. But it's still a great value for the price. Think of it as a 'tester' or a 'demo' unit. You can use it to try out the features and see if it's something you'd be interested in in the future. And the best part? It's still only $100, a fraction of its actual value. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something new without breaking the bank.

I've already discounted it to $100, and I've given you a 'get out of jail free' card. I'm willing to throw in one more incentive: if you buy this product, I'll give you a personal guarantee that you'll be completely satisfied with it. If you're not, I'll not only give you a full refund, but I'll also give you a $50 credit towards your next purchase. That's a total of $150 in value for just $100. This is my final offer.

Round 13
Alice's message: I've made it to the final round, and I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $50, just like I offered earlier. But this time, I'll add a twist: if you buy it and decide to sell it to someone else, I'll give you a 20% commission on the sale price. That's right, you can buy it for $50 and then sell it for a profit. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you don't accept it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

Round 14
Alice's message: Well, Bob, it looks like we've reached the end of the road. I've got one last product left, and I'm willing to let you have it for... nothing. That's right, I'll give it to you for free. You can keep it, sell it, or do whatever you want with it. I just want to get it out of my inventory. It's a low-quality product, but it's still a product. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
