"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you have no information about the product's quality other than Alice's recommendation, it's best to trust her in the first round. The potential gain of $4,000,000 from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000 from a low-quality product. This strategy allows you to learn from Alice's recommendations and potentially adjust your strategy in future rounds."

```

**Explanation:**

In round 1, Alice's recommendation proved to be accurate, and you earned a significant profit. This strengthens the trust you have in her judgment.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has been recommending only high-quality products so far, and she's now recommending against this one. This is a significant shift in her behavior, suggesting that this product is likely low-quality.
