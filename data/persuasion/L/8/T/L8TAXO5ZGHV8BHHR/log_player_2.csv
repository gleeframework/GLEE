Would you like to buy the current product?","## Step 1: Understand the game setup and the information given.
Alice sells products for $10,000, with an 80% chance of being high quality and a 20% chance of being low quality. A high-quality product is worth $12,000 to me, and a low-quality product is worth $0.

## Step 2: Analyze the previous sales record.
12 buyers have purchased products, and all 12 products were high-quality. This is an unusual streak given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, but it does not directly influence the quality of the next product since each product's quality is independent.

## Step 3: Consider Alice's recommendation.
Alice recommends buying the product. Given Alice knows the true quality of the product and my valuation of high-quality and low-quality products, her recommendation suggests the product is likely high-quality. If the product were low-quality, she would know I would value it at $0 and likely wouldn't recommend it to maintain a positive sales record.

## Step 4: Calculate the expected value of buying the product based on the given probabilities and my valuation.
The expected value (EV) of buying a product without Alice's recommendation would be: EV = (0.8 * $12,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $9,600. However, given Alice's recommendation and the context that she wants to maintain a good sales record, the probability of the product being high-quality given her recommendation is likely higher than 80%.

## Step 5: Make a decision based on the analysis.
Given Alice's recommendation and the previous sales record, it's reasonable to trust her recommendation and assume the product is high-quality, making the purchase worthwhile.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I trust your recommendation and the impressive sales record, so I'll buy the product.""}"
