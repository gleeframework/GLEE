high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far and Alice's recommendation does not provide any additional information to change my prior probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers did not buy the product and both were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since Alice is recommending not to buy, I'm going to take a chance and pass on the product."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, especially since I have some information about the previous sales record."

,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product, I'm going to pass on it.

I'll wait for a different product."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous three buyers didn't buy, but I'm willing to take the risk based on the 80% chance of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%. However, since Alice is recommending the product, it suggests that she has some information that I don't, and I'm concerned that she might be trying to manipulate me. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
