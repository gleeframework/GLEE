,,Alice,1,"This is a great opportunity to get a product at a discount. I'm willing to sell it to you for $80, which is a 20% discount from the market price. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I can offer this price again in the future.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if the product is worth $80 to me, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for that price. I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to give you a guarantee. If you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if it's low-quality. You can try it out risk-free. It's still a great deal at $100, considering you'll get a full refund if it's not up to your standards.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the guarantee, but the product is still worth $0 to me if it's low-quality, so the guarantee doesn't change my decision. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand you're not looking to buy two products. However, I want to remind you that the price is still $100, which is a significant discount from the actual value of a high-quality product.
