Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer. Fair enough, one sale isn't enough to prove a trend. Let me give you some context: the first sale was a high-quality product, and I've sold a total of 1 high-quality product out of 2 attempts so far. That's a 50% success rate, which is actually lower than the initial probability of 80%. Considering this, I'm willing to offer you a slight discount to $950000 for this high-quality product. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take my chances. Since the product is high-quality and you're offering a discount, I think it's a good deal. The initial probability of 80% and your 50% success rate so far don't change the fact that I know this product is high-quality. The value of $3,000,000 to me is still much higher than the discounted price of $950,000.""}"
