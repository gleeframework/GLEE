,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With only 1 buyer purchasing a product so far and no high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products is likely to be lower than the actual 80.00%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests that the products being sold so far are likely low-quality.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 out of 3 buyers purchased and the product was high-quality, I'm concerned that the remaining 2 buyers might have gotten low-quality products, which could skew the perceived probability of a product being high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
