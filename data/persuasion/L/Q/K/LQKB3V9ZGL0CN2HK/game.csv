,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't have any prior information to go on. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold. The probability of the current product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, since only 1 product has been sold, the sample size is too small to make a reliable inference. I'd rather wait for more data to be collected before making a decision."
