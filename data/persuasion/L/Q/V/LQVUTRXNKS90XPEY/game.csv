low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is not based on any information about my valuation, so I'm making this decision based on my own probability assessment of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 1 product was recommended, but none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation may not be reliable. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality, based on the current statistics."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know the total number of products offered and the proportion of high-quality products sold in the previous sales."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products offered before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality one for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice didn't recommend it, not because I have any information about its quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product since the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, which is lower than the 50% chance of a product being high-quality. I'm essentially buying on the basis of the absence of information, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced it's a good deal based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, I'm concerned that the product may be of low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $10000 for a product worth $0 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'm going to pass on this one and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"4 out of 12 products sold were high-quality, which is a significant improvement from the previous proportion."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous sales record, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/4, which is 0%. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still quite low. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is of higher quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products offered so far, to help me make a more informed decision for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,"5 out of 15 products sold were high-quality, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 1/3."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the products sold were low-quality, which would mean that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"6 out of 16 products sold were high-quality, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 3/8."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"7 out of 17 products sold were high-quality, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 7/17. The quality of the product is not dependent on my recommendation, and the previous buyers were not recommended to buy, but the product was still high-quality."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm going to pass as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample. Since all previous buyers have passed on the product, it's possible that the product is actually high-quality, and Alice's recommendation is just a result of confirmation bias. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to see if I get a high-quality one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,"8 out of 19 products sold were high-quality, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 8/19. I will make a recommendation based on the objective probability of the product being high-quality, not based on previous buyers' decisions."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"9 out of 20 products sold were high-quality, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 9/20. This is a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a good price, and I'm confident that this product is a good deal."
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the current statistics, 5 out of 5 products have been low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, I think the probability of this product being low-quality is higher than 50%. I would like to pass on this product."
