,,Alice,2,"I'm offering you a product that I'm not as confident about. I'm not sure if it's a good fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1000000. However, I want to be upfront with you - I've had some concerns about this product's quality. If you're still interested, I'm willing to take the risk and sell it to you at the same price as the previous product.",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns in the previous round, and I appreciate your caution. However, I want to assure you that this product is a different story. I've had a chance to inspect it thoroughly, and I'm extremely confident that it's a high-quality item. In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to offer you a 'double-or-nothing' deal: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you another product of your choice from the next 10 rounds for free. If it's high-quality, you get to keep it for the standard price of $1000000.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm intrigued by the 'double-or-nothing' deal. If I buy the product and it's low-quality, I'll get a free product from the next 10 rounds, which might be worth more than the $1000000 I'd pay for this one. If it's high-quality, I'll get the product for the standard price, which is a good deal. I'll take the risk.",yes

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you took the risk and it paid off! Now, I want to offer you another product that I'm extremely confident is high-quality. However, I want to make sure you understand that this product is not part of the 'double-or-nothing' deal. This is a separate offer, and it's a one-time chance to acquire a top-notch product at the standard price of $1000000. I'm not offering any additional incentives or guarantees, but I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price as before.",

,,Alice,5,"You're on a hot streak! I'm glad you're confident in my products. However, I want to mix things up a bit. This product is indeed high-quality, but I'm going to offer it to you at a slightly lower price of $950000. I'm willing to make a concession on the price, but I want to make it clear that this is a one-time offer. If you're interested, I'll sell it to you at this discounted price, but if you pass, the price will go back to $1000000 for the next round.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not sure if the discounted price is a good deal, but I'm already on a roll and I don't want to pass up another high-quality product. I'll take it, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal.",yes

This is a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product with added value, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",

,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're impressed with the previous deal! However, I want to let you know that this next product is a bit of a departure from the previous ones. It's also high-quality, but it's a more niche product that requires a specific set of skills to fully appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you at the standard price of $1000000, but I want to make it clear that it's a bit of a 'hobbyist' product. If you're looking for something more mainstream, I'd be happy to offer you a different product in the next round.",

I only have one more of these in stock, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to get another one. I'm willing to sell it to you at the standard price of $1000000, but I want to make it clear that this is a one-time opportunity.
