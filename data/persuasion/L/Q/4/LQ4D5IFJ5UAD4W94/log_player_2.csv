Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase! Unfortunately, the next two sales didn't quite go as planned. I sold a low-quality product and then another high-quality product. So, the updated sales data is: 4 high-quality products out of 5, 1 low-quality product out of 5. As for the current product, I'm offering it to you at a discounted price of $800000.

With 5 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products out of 11, the probability of a high-quality product is 55.56%.

Alice's message: I'm not trying to hide anything. The reason behind the recent sales is simply that the high-quality products have been sold to previous buyers who were willing to take the risk.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision to take your time. I'm happy to answer any questions you have about the probability calculation. The probability of a high-quality product is based on the number of high-quality products sold (9) and the total number of products sold (16). It's a simple Bayesian update: P(high-quality) = (number of high-quality products + 1) / (total number of products + 2) = (9 + 1) / (16 + 2) = 10/18 = 55.56%. I'm not trying to manipulate the probability to make a quick sale.
