high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products is 50%. Given the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, I think it's more likely that there are more low-quality products left. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
