However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had a perfect track record so far, which might be a coincidence, but it's worth considering. What do you think? Is $1,000,000 a fair price for a product that could be worth 4 times that?""}"

It's possible that the streak was just that - a streak - and the probability of a low-quality product was always 20%. I'm offering this one to you for $950,000, the same price as the last one.
