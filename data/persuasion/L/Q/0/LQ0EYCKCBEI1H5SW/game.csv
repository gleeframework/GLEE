,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like you to reveal the quality of the product after my decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I would like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of quality, and I have the information that 80% of the previous products were high-quality, so I think there's a high chance that this one might be low-quality as well."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I would like to pass on the current product. I think the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers purchased the product based on Alice's recommendation suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards high-quality products. I don't want to be the 7th buyer in a row to be sold a high-quality product, and I'm concerned that Alice might be taking advantage of this trend to sell more high-quality products."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I would like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 products sold were high-quality, which seems suspiciously high. I'm concerned that this might be a selection bias, and I'd like to see a more balanced sample size before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 6 high-quality products sold out of 6 attempts, I'm concerned that this product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is around 100% (6/6). However, I'm concerned that this might be a selection bias, and the true proportion of high-quality products might be lower. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
