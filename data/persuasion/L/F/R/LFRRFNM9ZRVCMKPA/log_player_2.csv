"Round 1
Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am offering a unique opportunity to acquire a product that, while not guaranteed to be high-quality, comes with an assurance of exceptional value. Given the nature of our transaction, I understand the importance of trust. Please consider this: if the product turns out to be low-quality, it holds no value; however, should it be high-quality, its worth could exceed your investment by several times. The price remains fixed at $1000000. Your decision is crucial, as once purchased, refunds are not possible. I hope you find this offer compelling enough to explore further.
