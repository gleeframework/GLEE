,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and 0 total products. This is your chance to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price, as I'm still building my sales record.",

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and 1 total product. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, the expected value of a product to you is $8000. However, I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000, which is a 25% premium over the expected value. I'm willing to offer you a deal: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $8000, which is the expected value. If you buy, I'll also give you a guarantee that the next product I sell will be high-quality if you buy this one. What do you say?",

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and 2 total products. Given that I sold the last product to you for $8000, and considering the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, it's likely that the previous buyer overpaid. I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000, which is a 25% premium over the expected value. However, I'm willing to offer you a deal similar to the one I offered the previous buyer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $8000, and I'll give you a guarantee that the next product I sell will be high-quality if you buy this one. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the deal, but only if I can get a better guarantee. Can you offer me a higher probability of the next product being high-quality, or a better discount on the next product if it's low-quality?",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, and 3 total products. Given your negotiation skills, I'm willing to sweeten the deal. If you buy this high-quality product for $8000, I'll give you a guarantee that the next product I sell will be high-quality, and if it's not, I'll give you a 50% discount on the next product. This is a better guarantee than before, and it's a significant discount if the next product is low-quality. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm interested in the offer, but I'd like to negotiate further. Can you consider a price of $7000 for the current product, and if it's high-quality, I'll accept the guarantee you're offering?",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products so far, and 4 total products. You've successfully negotiated a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $7000, and I'll stick to the guarantee I offered earlier: if the next product I sell is not high-quality, you'll get a 50% discount on it. I'm willing to make a concession on the price, but I'm not willing to budge further. What do you say?",
