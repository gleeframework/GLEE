low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,,,,,,,,
,,Alice,3,no,,,,,,,,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm not confident in the quality of this product.",,,,,,,
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,,,,,,,,
,,Alice,4,yes,,,,,,,,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.,,,,,,,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,,,,,,,,
,,Alice,5,no,,,,,,,,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the probability of a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk.",,,,,,,
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,,,,,,,,
,,Alice,6,yes,,,,,,,,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased based on the fact that she knows how much each product is worth to me.,,,,,,,

,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product. Can you explain why you think it's high-quality?,,,,,,,

,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 2 products sold was high-quality, which is a 50% success rate. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",,,,,,,
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,,,,,,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,"I understand your concern about the statistics, but I'd like to clarify that the 50% success rate is based on a small sample size. The actual probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 80%. My recommendations are based on my knowledge of the product's quality, and I assure you that this one is high-quality. I'm not trying to deceive or manipulate you. I want to build trust with buyers and sell as many high-quality products as possible.",,,,,,

Additionally, 2 high-quality products were not bought despite my positive recommendation. I assure you that this product is high-quality.",,,,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",,,,,,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,,,,,,,,
,,Alice,13,no,,"My recommendation is based on my knowledge of the product's quality. I can assure you that this product is low-quality, and I don't want to sell it to you as it would not meet your expectations. I want to maintain a good reputation and build trust with buyers by being transparent and honest about the products I sell.",,,,,,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product's quality based on your previous sales record?",,,,,,,

My goal is to sell as many high-quality products as possible, and I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality.",,,,,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you provide the detailed statistics of the 3 previous sales, including the quality of the products sold and the recommendations you provided to the previous buyers?",,,,,,,
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,,,,,,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,,,,"The 3 previous sales were: Round 14 (high-quality product, recommended to buy, but not bought), Round 13 (low-quality product, not recommended to buy, but bought), and Round 12 (low-quality product, not recommended to buy, and not bought). My goal is to be transparent and provide accurate information to help you make an informed decision. I assure you that this product is high-quality.",,,

I believe the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 80%, and I recommend buying it.",,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased, and I want to wait for more information.",,,,,,,
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,,,,,,,,
,,Alice,18,yes,,"I understand that previous buyers may have had concerns about my recommendations, but I assure you that I am being honest and transparent about the product's quality. I have no incentive to deceive or mislead buyers, and my goal is to sell as many high-quality products as possible. I am confident that this product is high-quality, and I recommend buying it.",,,,,,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that you recommended it might be influenced by the fact that 3 out of the first 3 products were low-quality, which might skew your recommendation towards the fourth product being high-quality. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is.",,,,,,,
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,,,,,,,,
,,Alice,19,yes,,,,,,,"I'd like to clarify that the quality of the products is independent of each other, and I have knowledge of each product's quality. My recommendations are based on this knowledge, not on the sequence of previous products. I assure you that this product is high-quality, and I recommend buying it.",
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as Alice's recommendation doesn't take into account my knowledge of the product's true quality, and I don't have any information about the previous products sold to other buyers. I'd like to see the product's quality before making a decision.",,,,,,,

,,Alice,20,yes,,,,,,,,"This is the final round, and I want to assure you that I have been honest and transparent in all my recommendations.
