Alice's message: I understand your skepticism. I've sold 4 products, with 2 of them being high-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but I want to offer you a unique opportunity to take advantage of a low price. This item is available for $10000, a price that's 100% of its value to you, but only 80% of its true value to me. I'm willing to take a loss to move this item quickly.

Alice's message: You're right to question the probability. With 2 high-quality products out of 5 buyers, the probability of this product being high-quality is actually lower than the overall probability. I'll be honest with you, I've had a bit of a streak of bad luck lately. This item is available for $10000, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you.
