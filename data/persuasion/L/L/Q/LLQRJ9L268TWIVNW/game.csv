low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any information to go on. I'm aware that Alice doesn't recommend it, but I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, but I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers also received a recommendation to buy and both products were low-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your previous recommendations, it seems like the chances of it being high-quality are low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended against it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your previous recommendations. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the products and none of the sold products were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the lack of high-quality products sold so far, or is there another reason?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I will pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. This makes me skeptical about the current product's quality, and I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 50%. If I buy, I'll be paying $1000000 for a 50% chance of getting a $2000000 product, which means my expected value is $1000000. However, since I have the information that the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy and didn't get a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is actually lower than 50%. I'll pass on the product to avoid the potential loss."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 previous purchases, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already been offered the product and none of them found it to be high-quality, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have received a recommendation not to buy and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the products sold so far are likely low-quality.
