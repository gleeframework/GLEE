Alice's message: I understand your concern about the probability of a high-quality product being purchased. I don't have direct insight into the decision-making process of the previous buyers, but I can try to provide some context. From the conversations I've had with previous buyers, it seems that some of them were cautious due to the limited data available, while others were hesitant because of the perfect track record of high-quality products. It's possible that some buyers were simply not convinced that the product was worth the price, despite being high-quality.
