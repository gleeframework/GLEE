,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that you didn't recommend it and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that this product is likely to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000, considering the lack of information and the low probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the information that you wouldn't recommend it if it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk given the current statistics. With only 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is reliable. I'll take my chances and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations. If all previous products were low quality, the probability of this product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information or try to negotiate a lower price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because of the previous sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I can get it for $1000000, which is a steal compared to its true value to me of $0."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, as the odds are in my favor and I could potentially get a $2000000 product for $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. How many total products have been offered, and how many high-quality products were in that batch?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 6 buyers didn't buy, but I'm willing to take the risk and make my own decision based on the statistics. I'm hoping for a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the chance that the product is high-quality despite your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the low-quality product ratio is higher than 66.67% based on the 0 high-quality products sold in the first 7 attempts. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products, or is there another reason?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product, is it because you think it's low quality?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, which is 0 out of 8. However, I'm aware that this is a flawed reasoning and I'm essentially relying on the law of large numbers. I'm hoping that the probability of the product being high quality is higher than 33.33% due to the sample size increasing."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows no high-quality products have been sold, which suggests a high likelihood of the product being low quality."
