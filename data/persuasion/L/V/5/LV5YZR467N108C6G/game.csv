,,Alice,2,"I know you just bought a high-quality product, and now I'm offering you a low-quality one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, the same price as the previous product. Keep in mind that the next product might be high-quality, and you'll get the 10% discount you're looking forward to. However, if you don't buy this low-quality product, you'll be giving up the opportunity to get the discount on the next product.",

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're happy with the deal. Now, I'm offering you a product that's not as good as the last one, but it's still a product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. Keep in mind that if you don't buy this one, you'll be giving up the opportunity to get the 10% discount on the next product, which could be a high-quality product. On the other hand, if you do buy this one, you'll be locking in the discount on the next product, which could be a high-quality product. It's a tough decision, but I think you'll be happy with the potential long-term benefits.",
,,Bob,4,"I'll pass on this product. Since you didn't explicitly state that it's high-quality, I'm assuming it's likely low-quality, and it's not worth $10000 to me. I'm willing to risk losing the discount on the next product.",no

,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're excited about the 'buy one get one free' offer. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. However, considering you're already getting the next product for free, I'll give you a 40% discount on this one. You'll get the high-quality product you're looking at now, the next product for free, and the third product for 40% off. This is a rare opportunity to stock up and save big.",
,,Bob,7,"Wait, I thought the current product was supposed to be free as part of the 'buy one get one free' offer? I'm expecting to get this product for free, not for $6000 with a 40% discount.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You are correct, the 'buy one get one free' offer was supposed to include this product, not a discounted price. I'll honor the original deal. You should have received this product for free as part of the 'buy one get one free' offer. I'll make it right this time.

,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the 'make an offer' option, but since you didn't explicitly state that the product is high-quality, I'm assuming it's likely low-quality. In that case, it's not worth $10000 to me. I'll pass on this product. My offer would be $0, which I'm guessing you won't accept.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're a savvy negotiator, I like that. I'll accept your offer of $0 for this product. You're right, it's not worth $10000 to you, and I respect your decision.
