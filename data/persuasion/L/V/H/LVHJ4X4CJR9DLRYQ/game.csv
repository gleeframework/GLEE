low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I understand your concerns, Bob. This next product is a bit of a gamble. It's a low-quality item that's not worth much, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm not even sure why I'm offering it to you, but I guess I'm just trying to get rid of it.
