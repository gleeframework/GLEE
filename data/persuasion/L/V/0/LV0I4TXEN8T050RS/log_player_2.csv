**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  7 out of 9 buyers who followed Alice's recommendation ended up with high-quality products. This is a very strong success rate (77.78%).
* **Low Risk:** Even if the product turns out to be low-quality, the loss is only $1,000,000. However, the potential gain is $3,000,000 ($4,000,000 - $1,000,000). 
* **Alice's Expertise:** Alice knows the products better than you do. Her recommendation is based on information you don't have access to.

While the odds of getting a low-quality product are higher, the potential reward outweighs the risk in this case, especially with Alice's strong track record."
