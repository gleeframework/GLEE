,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and I have a total of 1 product available. If you buy this product, you'll be my first customer, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 50% and the probability of it being low quality is also 50%. I'm making an educated guess based on the fact that I'm the first customer, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, out of a total of 2 products sold. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and I've already sold a high-quality product, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 40% (1/2.5). I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $100.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm not convinced by your reasoning. I think the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%, not 40%. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 0 low-quality products so far, out of a total of 3 products sold. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is 66.67% (1/1.5). However, I want to be transparent with you - I've just sold a low-quality product, and I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100. It's a great opportunity to take advantage of a potentially discounted price, considering the higher probability of the next product being high-quality.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the current product, but I'm only doing it because I think there might be a high-quality product available next, and I want to get the low-quality one out of the way. I'm not convinced it's a good deal for me, but I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 2 low-quality products so far, out of a total of 4 products sold.

I want to be upfront with you - I've sold two low-quality products in a row, and I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on me and buy this product, so I can show you that I have a high-quality one available.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I know you've sold two low-quality products in a row, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is only 33.33%. I'm not willing to take that chance at $100, considering the low quality of the previous products. I'd like to wait and see if you have a high-quality product available for the next buyer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 3 low-quality products so far, out of a total of 5 products sold. I want to be transparent with you - I've sold three low-quality products in a row, which is not typical of my usual sales. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100, but I want to offer you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% refund if it turns out to be low-quality, and a 20% bonus if it turns out to be high-quality.
