,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the probability of this product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is 100%, which is higher than the true probability of 33.33%. I'm hoping that this is just a coincidence and the true proportion is lower, so the product I'm being offered might still be high-quality."
