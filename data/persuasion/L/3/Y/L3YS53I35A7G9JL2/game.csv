high-quality,400.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see the next one. I'd like to know the probability of the next product being high quality based on the updated statistics after my decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since there's no data to go by and I'm essentially at a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0% success rate so far, but I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous two products were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 buyers have already passed on the products, and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if I can get a better idea of the product quality distribution."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product based on your past recommendations, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can tell me the probability that it's high quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%, and it's not worth the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, I'll pass on this product. I'm curious to see if it's high or low quality, but I'm not going to take the risk. Maybe the next product will be better."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I suspect that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a product that has not been recommended by Alice, or for more information about the sales record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the current statistics?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not buying this product based on your previous recommendations. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, it seems like the odds are against me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to take the risk. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is low. I'd rather pass and see if the next buyer has better luck."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the previous sales record."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending me to buy the product. Is it because of the previous sales record?
