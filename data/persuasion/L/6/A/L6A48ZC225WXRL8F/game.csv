,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $10000. I've sold many products to customers like you before, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to take a chance and make it yours?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and I'd like to know more about your sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products you have available and the proportion of high-quality products you've sold in the past?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I have a total of 39 products available, and I've sold 13 of them so far. 4 of those sold products were high-quality, which means I've sold 9 low-quality products. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. It's a great opportunity to take a chance on a unique item. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I'm not sure of its quality and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, but I want to assure you that I'm transparent about my sales record. I've sold 13 products so far, and 4 of them were high-quality. That means 9 out of 13 sold products were low-quality, and this one might be one of them. I'm offering it to you for $10000, and I'm willing to give you a heads up: if you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll offer you a chance to return it and get a refund... but you have to buy it first. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to decline the offer for now. I'd like to know more about the sales record. Can you tell me more about the 9 low-quality products that were sold? Were they all sold at the same price, and did you offer any refunds or replacements to the buyers who purchased them?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see you're a savvy buyer! I appreciate your diligence. To answer your question, all 9 low-quality products were sold at the same price of $10000. As for refunds or replacements, I don't offer any. Once a product is sold, it's non-refundable. However, I'm still offering you this product for $10000, and I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a detailed explanation of why it's low-quality. Would you like to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'd like to know more about the products before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of a product being high-quality?",no

,,Alice,5,"The probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm offering you this product for $10000, and I'm willing to give you a heads up: since you're my 5th buyer, I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 13 total sales, and 9 low-quality products. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on this one. Would you like to make it yours?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 13 products so far, and 4 of them were high-quality. That means 9 out of 13 sold products were low-quality, and this one might be one of them. I'm offering it to you for $10000. As a friendly seller, I want to remind you that you can always ask me any questions you have, and I'll do my best to provide you with more information. What do you think?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I see you're a statistician! The probability of this product being high-quality, given that 4 out of 13 sold products were high-quality, is 4/13 = 30.77%. I'm offering you this product for $10000. I'm willing to give you a deal: if you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on your next purchase. Would you like to take a chance?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're interested in the product! The probability of a product being high-quality, without considering the previous sales record, is still 33.33%. I'm offering you this product for $10000. I want to remind you that I've sold 14 products so far, and 4 of them were high-quality. That means 10 out of 14 sold products were low-quality, and this one might be one of them. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, given the low-quality product ratio in your previous sales. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, but I want to assure you that I'm transparent about my sales record. I've sold 14 products so far, and 4 of them were high-quality. That means 10 out of 14 sold products were low-quality, and this one might be one of them. However, I'd like to point out that the probability of this product being high-quality remains 33.33%, regardless of the previous sales record. I'm offering it to you for $10000. Would you like to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,9,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. I'd like to know more about the sales record. Can you tell me the distribution of the 10 low-quality products you sold? Was it a uniform distribution, or were they all sold at the same time?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you're interested in the details! The 10 low-quality products I sold were not sold at the same time. They were sold over the course of 9 rounds, with 1 low-quality product sold in each of the first 9 rounds. I'm offering you this product, which is the 10th low-quality product, for $10000. The probability of it being high-quality remains 33.33%. Would you like to take a chance?",

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I see you're a skeptical buyer! I understand your concerns, but I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, regardless of the previous sales record. I've sold 12 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. That means 11 out of 12 sold products were low-quality, and this one might be the 2nd high-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $10000. Would you like to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,12,"I'll take a chance, but I'm not convinced that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% based on the previous sales record. Can you explain why you're still offering the product at the same price?",yes

,,Alice,14,"I'm glad you're interested in the product! However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to negotiate the price. I'm offering this product for $10000, and that's the final price.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You're my 14th buyer, and I've sold 14 products so far. 2 of them were high-quality, and 12 of them were low-quality. That means the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 2/14 = 14.29%. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. As you can see, the probability of it being high-quality is lower than the overall probability, but it's still a chance. Would you like to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,15,"I'd like to take the chance. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the possibility of getting a high-quality product, especially since the overall probability of high-quality products sold is lower than the overall probability, but still, it's a chance.",yes

,,the buyer,17,"I'll take the product. Given the probability of 41.67% for a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, as the potential gain is significant ($2500) and the cost of a low-quality product is $0.",yes
