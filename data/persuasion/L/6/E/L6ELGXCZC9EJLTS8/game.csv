As a seller, I want to be transparent with you - I've had a mix of high-quality and low-quality products so far, but I'm still building my reputation. Since I've only sold 1 product, I don't have enough data to guarantee the quality of this one. Would you like to take a chance and see if you get a high-quality product or not?",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  However, with only one sale and no way to know if the previous buyer got a high-quality product, it's too risky for me. I'll pass on this one for now and see how your sales record develops. Best of luck!",no

Would you like to take advantage of this trend and get a high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable buying without more information.

Would you like to take advantage of this potential streak and get a high-quality product, or would you rather wait and see how my sales record develops further?",
