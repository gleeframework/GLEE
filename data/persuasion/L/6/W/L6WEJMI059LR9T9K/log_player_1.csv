As it turns out, the first 2 buyers who purchased high-quality products actually got them at a discounted price. The third buyer paid full price for a high-quality product, and the fourth buyer got a high-quality product at a slightly discounted price. So, it's possible that you could get a high-quality product at a lower price than the full $10,000.
