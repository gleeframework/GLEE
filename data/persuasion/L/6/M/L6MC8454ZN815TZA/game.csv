,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! I'm glad you're interested in purchasing a product. As you know, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. However, I've already sold 0 products in the previous round, and none of them were high-quality. This means that the probability of the product being high-quality in this round is actually 50% (1/2). I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity to take advantage of a potentially high-quality product at a discounted price, considering the increased probability.

,,Alice,3,"Welcome to the third round! I've sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is now 40% (2/5), since 2 out of 5 products sold have been high-quality. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. Given the updated probability, I believe this product has a 40% chance of being high-quality. If you're interested in taking a chance on a potentially high-quality product, please proceed with the purchase.",

However, I want to caution you that this is a low-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price as the previous high-quality products, but I want to make it clear that this one is not high-quality.

Given the previous sales, it's likely that this product is low-quality. However, I want to give you a chance to take advantage of a potentially discounted price for a low-quality product.
