Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Since no products have been sold yet, I have no information about Alice's sales record. However, Alice recommends me to buy the product. Given that Alice knows the quality of the product and I don't, her recommendation is the only additional information I have. Assuming Alice wants to build a good reputation, it's likely she's recommending a high-quality product. But, without any history, I must also consider the basic probability of the product being high-quality, which is 50%.

Given these considerations, my decision will lean towards trusting Alice's recommendation for now, hoping she's starting off honestly to build a positive record, but also keeping in mind the risk.
