I'm willing to make a statement about its value: I'm offering it to you for the same price as the previous one, $100. It's a steal at this price, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line for it.

But if you are satisfied, I'll throw in a special deal: I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me. What do you say?

As you can see, this one is actually a more advanced model, with some features you might find useful. However, I must warn you that it's not as polished as the previous one. Still, I think it's a great value at $100. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the comparison, but I'm not convinced that this one is worth $100, especially since the previous one was already worth $300 to me. I'll pass on this one.""}"
