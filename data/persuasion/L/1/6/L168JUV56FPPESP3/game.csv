,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because you think it's low quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, based on Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer is more optimistic."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous buyer's purchase or the product's quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I want to get a better sense of the distribution of high-quality products. If I pass, I'll be giving up valuable information to you, and I'd rather get a direct experience."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, especially since I know the probability of it being high quality is 33.33%"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the previous sales record, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3, which is significantly lower than the expected 1/3. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, or is it because you think the product is low-quality?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendations, I'm inclined to think that the products they received were low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and 3 out of 3 previous products were not recommended, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'll pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I can get it for $1000000, which is a relatively low price compared to its potential value of $3000000."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that all previous buyers have also bought the product and none of them got a high-quality one. I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
