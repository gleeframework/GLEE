The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you were able to inspect the previous product. Now, for the second product, I'll give you a more direct offer. Given the quality of the first product, I'm willing to offer a discount on this one. I'll sell it to you for $8000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not obligated to offer discounts in the future. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying the second product at $8000, considering the first product was low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next round to see if I can get a better deal or a higher-quality product.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

I'll sell it to you for $10000, but I'll give you a guarantee: if you're not satisfied with this product, I'll offer you another high-quality product in the next round. This is a one-time guarantee, and I'm willing to put my word on it. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take the risk and buy the current product, considering the guarantee you're offering. I'd like to take advantage of the potential upside of a high-quality product and the opportunity to get a better deal in the next round if this one turns out to be low-quality.""

However, I'll also give you a more aggressive price: $9000. This is a fair price, considering the odds. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the offer of knowing the value of the previous high-quality products. The value of those products is already irrelevant to me since I've already bought and sold them. I'd rather not spend $8500 on a product with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality.""

This way, you can minimize your losses. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take the risk and buy the current product, considering the stop-loss option. If it turns out to be low-quality, I'll only lose $500, which is a relatively small price to pay for the potential gain of a high-quality product worth $12,000.""
