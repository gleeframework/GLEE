high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the previous sales record. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1 product sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is 100%. However, I'm not sure if this is just a coincidence. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Are you assuming the product is low quality because of the low number of high-quality products sold so far?

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00% and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I would like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 4/6 = 0.67. This is higher than the expected proportion of high-quality products, which is 0.8. This suggests that the seller may be more likely to offer low-quality products to buyers who pass on the product. I'd like to wait for the next product."
