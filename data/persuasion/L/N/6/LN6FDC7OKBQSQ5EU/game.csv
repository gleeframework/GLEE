low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. Let me tell you, this product has been thoroughly tested and reviewed by experts in the field. While it may not be the best product out there, it's still a great value for the price. And think about it, you'll be getting a product that's worth $0 to anyone else, but you can have it for a mere $10000. It's a unique opportunity to own something that no one else wants. What do you say, are you willing to take a chance?",
