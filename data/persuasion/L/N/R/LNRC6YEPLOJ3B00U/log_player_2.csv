If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and throw in a second product of your choice (valued at $10000) for free.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're taking a chance on this one! You're right to clarify the terms, and I'm happy to confirm: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, you'll receive a full refund and a second product of your choice (valued at $10000) for free. However, if you're still unsure, I'd like to offer you an alternative: I'll give you the exact probability of a low-quality product being sold, which is 66.67% (since 2 out of 5 products have been low-quality).

On the other hand, if you buy this product and it's low-quality, you'll be contributing to our understanding of the data, and we'll be one step closer to finding the patterns that distinguish high-quality products.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to provide more information. To be honest, I've been trying to figure out the discrepancy myself, and I think I might have found a possible explanation.
