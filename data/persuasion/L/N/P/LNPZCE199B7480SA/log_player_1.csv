Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the buyer in round 1 bought the low-quality product, and they were not influenced by my recommendation, I can infer that they must have estimated the probability of the product being high-quality as 33.33% or lower, since they bought it.

I will take advantage of this new information and recommend the buyer to buy the product.

Additionally, I'll try to address the buyer's concern about the bias by providing more information.

""I understand your concern about the previous sales record. However, I assure you that the products are randomly selected, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33% as stated.
