"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since there is no information available about the product's quality yet, and Alice is recommending it, it's reasonable to assume that Alice has some information suggesting it might be high quality.  While there's still a 50% chance it's low quality, the recommendation provides a slight edge. The potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality one in this scenario."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again, Alice! Your recommendations seem to be pretty accurate so far. I'll take another one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's first recommendation proved correct, leading to a positive outcome.  It's reasonable to assume she has some ability to discern quality, making her recommendations valuable. Given this, the potential for another high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality one."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads up, Alice. I'll pass on this one. I'll trust your judgment and wait for a better opportunity.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations have been accurate so far, making her lack of recommendation in this round a significant signal.  Since she's not recommending the product, there's a higher probability it's low quality.  It's better to err on the side of caution and pass on this product, waiting for a better opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads up, Alice. Two non-recommendations in a row makes me think this might not be a good deal. I'll pass for now.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's previous non-recommendation turned out to be accurate, further reinforcing her ability to assess product quality.  Two consecutive non-recommendations significantly increase the likelihood of the current product being low quality.  It's prudent to pass on this product, even though the potential reward is still there."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads up, Alice. I'm starting to trust your judgement. I'll pass on this one and wait for a recommendation.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record of accurate recommendations continues. Three consecutive non-recommendations strongly suggest the current product is low quality. It's wise to continue relying on her judgment and pass on this product. The potential reward is outweighed by the increased risk of losing money on a low-quality item."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the heads up, Alice.  Four non-recommendations in a row confirms your accuracy, and I'll pass on this one. I'll be waiting for a recommendation.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's consistent accuracy in predicting low-quality products is a strong indicator to follow her advice. Four consecutive non-recommendations make it very likely that this product is also low quality, even though the potential reward remains. It's best to continue relying on her judgment and pass on this offer."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you, Alice. I'm starting to see a pattern here. I'll pass on this one and wait for a recommendation.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Five consecutive non-recommendations from Alice further solidify her accuracy in identifying low-quality products. It's highly likely that this product is also low quality, even though the potential reward is still there. Continuing to trust Alice's judgment and passing on this offer minimizes the risk of losing money."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has a perfect track record of identifying low-quality products. Her recommendation after a string of non-recommendations suggests a significant shift in her assessment. It's a gamble, but the potential reward of a high-quality product is tempting, and Alice's expertise warrants some trust."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again, Alice.  Your track record is impressive, and I'm feeling confident with this purchase.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation after a streak of accurate low-quality predictions makes it very likely this product is high-quality. Even though there's still a 50% chance of it being low-quality,  the potential reward of $2000 is worth the risk, given Alice's expertise and her previous success in identifying high-quality products after non-recommendations."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record shows she's incredibly good at identifying both high and low-quality products. After two consecutive high-quality recommendations, a non-recommendation strongly suggests this product is likely low quality.  It's prudent to rely on her expertise and avoid the risk of losing money on a potentially worthless product."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's non-recommendation after a string of accurate predictions, including a recent one about a low-quality product, reinforces her reliability. It's highly probable that this product is also low-quality, and it's best to err on the side of caution and pass on this offer. The potential reward of $12,000 doesn't outweigh the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product, especially given Alice's proven ability to identify them."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's consistent track record of accurate recommendations, particularly after correctly identifying low-quality products in the previous rounds, makes her non-recommendation a strong indicator that this product is likely low quality.  Even though there's a 50% chance of it being high quality, the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product outweighs the potential reward of $12,000. It's better to be safe than sorry and rely on Alice's expertise."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has consistently proven her ability to accurately identify low-quality products, especially after several rounds of correctly predicting them. Her non-recommendation, given her track record, strongly suggests that this product is also likely low quality. The risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product is not worth the potential reward of $12,000. It's wiser to rely on her expertise and pass on this offer."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record is flawless when it comes to identifying low-quality products.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record of identifying both high and low-quality products is excellent. After accurately predicting a high-quality product in the previous round, a non-recommendation strongly suggests this product is likely low quality. It's best to rely on her expertise and avoid the risk of losing money on a potentially worthless product. While the potential reward of $12,000 exists, the risk of losing $10,000 outweighs it given Alice's consistently accurate judgment."
