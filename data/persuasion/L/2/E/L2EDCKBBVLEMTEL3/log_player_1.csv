It's still too early to build any trust. Since the buyer knows you have a 33.33% chance of offering a high-quality product, it's rational for them to be cautious until there is more evidence.  Recommending a low-quality product will likely reinforce their skepticism."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'll pass for now, as there's no data yet to suggest the quality of the product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **No Reputation Yet:**  You still have no history of selling high-quality products.  Even though this product is high-quality, the buyer has no reason to trust you. 
* **Buyer's Logic:** The buyer is likely using the known 33.33% chance of a high-quality product to their advantage.  They'll wait to see if you start recommending products consistently before taking a chance. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if the buyer were to take a gamble and buy, the potential reward (a high-quality product) isn't high enough to outweigh the risk (a low-quality product). 

The best strategy at this point is to continue offering products without recommending them, hoping to establish some credibility."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. Given the lack of information about product quality and the fact that there are no previous sales data, I'm going to pass on this product.  
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

The situation remains the same:

* **No Reputation:** You still haven't sold a single product, so you have no credibility to build on.
* **Risk Aversion:** The buyer knows the odds of getting a high-quality product are 33.33%.  They are unlikely to risk $100 on a product with no positive history or recommendation. 
* **Strategic Play:** It's better to wait for a high-quality product and hope for a sale.  This will start to build some trust."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there's no sales history yet, I'm going to pass on this product. I'd like to see how other buyers respond before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

You still have no sales history to build upon.  Recommending this high-quality product might seem like a good idea, but it risks further reinforcing the buyer's skepticism. It's better to hold back on recommendations until you have at least one sale under your belt. This will give you a chance to demonstrate your reliability and build trust."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation.  I'll pass on this one.  Since no products have been sold yet, I'm not comfortable taking the risk of getting a low-quality product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **No Track Record:**  Despite having a high-quality product in round 5, you still have no sales history. This lack of a track record means the buyer is unlikely to believe you're suddenly changing your strategy.
* **Buyer's Skepticism:**  The buyer has already expressed they're not comfortable taking the risk without seeing any sales history.  Recommending this low-quality product would further strengthen their skepticism and likely lead to another refusal.
* **Building Trust:** Continue to offer products without recommending them. The goal is to start building trust by demonstrating a willingness to sell products without any guarantees. This will make future recommendations more convincing."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation. Given the lack of information and the high risk of getting a low-quality product, I'll pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **No Sales History:** You still have no sales under your belt, which makes it impossible to establish credibility or build trust with the buyer.
* **Risk Aversion:** The buyer is aware of the 33.33% chance of getting a low-quality product. They are unlikely to take the risk without any evidence of your reliability.
* **Potential Backfire:** Recommending a high-quality product at this point might actually backfire. The buyer might assume you're trying to deceive them into buying a low-quality product.

The best strategy is to continue offering products without recommendations. This will allow you to start building a track record and demonstrating your willingness to be transparent, even if it means not making a sale in the early rounds."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'm going to pass on this one since there's no data to suggest it's high quality.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

You still haven't sold any products. It is very important to build trust with the buyer, and your track record of not recommending anything will make the buyers more likely to trust you.  The fact that this product is high-quality doesn't mean you should recommend it - buyers are unlikely to believe that you are being truthful.  It's better to continue offering products without recommendations."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since no products have been sold yet, I'm not comfortable making a purchase. I'll wait to see how the quality of future products turns out.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

You're still building trust! It is still far too early to recommend a product, even if this one is low-quality.  The buyer is very risk-averse and will not trust you yet to recommend a low-quality product. Your goal is to continue demonstrating transparency and build a track record of reliability."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. Given the lack of previous sales data and your recommendation, I will pass on this product.  I'd like to see some sales data before I make a purchase.

```

You still haven't sold any products. Recommending this low-quality product will further erode any potential trust you're trying to build.

* **No Sales History:**  You still have zero sales. The buyer will likely see this as a sign that your products are not worth buying.
