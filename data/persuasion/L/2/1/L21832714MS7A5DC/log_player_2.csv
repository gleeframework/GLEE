**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** 2 out of 2 products sold so far were high quality. This suggests a very high probability that the current product is also high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the positive signal. Even if she doesn't know the exact value to each buyer, she likely has some information about the products, and her recommendation is likely based on that.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($200) outweighs the risk of losing $100."
