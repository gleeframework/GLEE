,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, there's only 1 high-quality product out of 1 sold, and Alice's recommendation is not convincing enough for me to take the risk."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering it's the second product and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of its quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2 purchases, I'm not convinced that the probability of the current product being high-quality is high enough to warrant the purchase price of $100."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5.
