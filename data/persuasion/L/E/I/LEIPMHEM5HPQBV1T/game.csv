high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the 2 high-quality products out of 3 sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is around 66.67%. However, given the low overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%), I'm not convinced that this product is worth the $1000000 price tag. I'd like to wait for more information or a better deal."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the previous sales record, 2 out of 3 products were high-quality, which is higher than the expected 80.00%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low number of sales and the fact that Alice's recommendation is not based on any information about my valuation of the product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that 2 out of the first 3 products were high-quality, so she's likely trying to maximize her sales by recommending the next one. I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or not, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000 if it's low-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the products after Alice's recommendations, I suspect that Alice might be biased towards recommending high-quality products, which could lead to a lower probability of a high-quality product being offered to me. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer will buy it."
