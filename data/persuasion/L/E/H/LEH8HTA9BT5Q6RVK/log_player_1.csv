I'm still confident you'll find it useful, but I want to be transparent about the quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as the previous ones, $10,000. If you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked.""

I'm willing to sell this product to you for $9,000, and I'll throw in a 10-year warranty to give you peace of mind. That's the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a good deal.""

I'm essentially giving it away, and I'm only doing this because I want to clear out some inventory and make room for new products.
