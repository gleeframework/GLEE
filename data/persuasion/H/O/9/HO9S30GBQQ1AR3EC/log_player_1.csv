  ""message"": ""This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. It's a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll have to sell it to someone else. The product is worth $1,200,000 to you, so you'll be getting a great deal!""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not sure if this is a high-quality product or not, and even if it is, I'm not sure if it's worth the price you're asking. I'd like to see more information or at least have the option to inspect the product before making a decision.

}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in the product at this price, even with the discount. The discount is not enough to outweigh the risk that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see the product's features and specifications, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth the price.

}"
"Bob's message: I'm not convinced by the money-back guarantee. If the product is low-quality, I'll get a $900000 refund, but if it's high-quality, I'll be paying $900000 more than the market value of $1200000. I'd rather not take on that risk.
