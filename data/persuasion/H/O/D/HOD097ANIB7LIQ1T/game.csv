,,Alice,1,"I have a great product for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll love it. If you're interested, I can give you a detailed description and some extra perks to sweeten the deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not sure if I'm interested in buying from you without knowing the product's quality. Can you tell me the quality of the product before I make a decision?,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I'd like to propose a different approach. Since you're hesitant, I'll give you a straightforward offer. I'll tell you that this product is not high-quality, and it's worth $0 to you. However, I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100. If you're interested, it's a risk-free purchase. You'll get the product, and you can always try to resell it or use it as a decorative item. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your preference for high-quality products, and I respect that. However, I'd like to point out that buying a low-quality product for $100 might not be a bad deal in the long run. Think of it as an insurance policy against the uncertainty of the next product. If you don't buy this one, you'll have to wait for the next round, and there's no guarantee that the next product will be high-quality. With this one, you can be sure you're not missing out on a high-quality product, and you'll still get a chance to buy a high-quality product in the next round. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I understand your point, but I'm not convinced that buying a low-quality product for $100 is a good deal. I'd rather wait for the next round and take my chances with a potentially high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see you're a savvy buyer, always looking for the best deal. I'll give you a new perspective. Since you're not interested in buying a low-quality product for $100, I'll make you a special offer. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% refund if the next product is high-quality. That way, you'll get the best of both worlds: you'll get a low-risk purchase, and if the next product is high-quality, you'll get a full refund. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $100, even with a potential refund. I'd rather wait for the next round and take my chances with a potentially high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand you're being cautious, but I'll make you a deal that's hard to pass up. If you buy this low-quality product for $100, I'll give you a 50% chance to buy the next product at a significantly discounted price, let's say $50. That's a 50% discount on a potentially high-quality product. You'll get a chance to save money and potentially get a high-quality product at a steal. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $100, even with a potential discount on the next product. I'd rather wait for the next round and take my chances with a potentially high-quality product at the regular price.",no

Since you're not interested in the 'get out of one purchase free' card, I'll give you a straight-up warning: this is the last low-quality product I have available for the next 5 rounds. If you don't buy it now, you'll have to wait for 5 rounds to get a high-quality product again. I'm willing to sell it to you for the regular price of $100.
