high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products recommended by you have been low-quality. I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations have been incorrect so far, and I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 products recommended by you have been low quality. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous two buyers purchased the product and that there are no high-quality products sold yet. This suggests that the products sold so far were likely low-quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at a fixed price of $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can I see the statistics on the products sold so far? How many products were sold and how many of them were high-quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker and I think the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers passed on the products, I'm inclined to think that the products they saw were low-quality, which would suggest that the remaining products are more likely to be high-quality. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal on a product that has been passed on by previous buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk based on the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far."

,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics you've provided so far. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
