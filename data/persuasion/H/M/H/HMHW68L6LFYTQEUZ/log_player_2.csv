Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a premium product! With 1 out of 1 products sold so far being high-quality, the chances are very high that this one is also a winner. Don't miss out on this opportunity to get a product worth $200 to you. The price is still $100, a steal considering the potential value. What do you say? Will you take the chance?

Alice's message: I understand your cautious approach! With only 2 out of 2 products sold so far being high-quality, it's natural to want to see more data.
