**Reasoning:**

Since you are the seller and you know this product is high-quality, you should recommend Bob to buy it.

This is a good opportunity for Bob to potentially get a good deal, as he knows there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!
