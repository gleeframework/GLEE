,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product for $100, but it's also possible that it's a low-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering the potential value of a high-quality product is $400. If you're not sure, you can always wait for the next round, but I think this is a good chance to take a risk and potentially get a great product.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took a chance on the first product! Unfortunately, this one is also a low-quality product. I want to be transparent with you, and I think it's clear that the previous product was just a fluke. This one is definitely not worth $100, but I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price. I'm confident that the next product will be a high-quality one, and I don't want you to miss out on that opportunity. Think of this as a learning experience and a chance to get a better deal on the next one.",

,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your hesitation after the last two low-quality products. But I assure you, this one is different. I've taken extra care to ensure that this product meets the highest standards. I'm willing to offer you a special deal on this one: I'll sell it to you for $80, which is a significant discount from the original price of $100. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a great price. What do you say?",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product and it paid off! Now, I want to assure you that this one is also a high-quality product. I've been selling these products for a while now, and I think I've got a good sense of when they're going to be high-quality. This one is definitely one of them. I'm willing to sell it to you for the full price of $100, but I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a $20 discount on the next product you buy from me. That way, you'll get a great deal either way!",

This next product is also a high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the full price of $100. However, I want to make it even more enticing. Since you've already taken advantage of the guarantee once, I'll give you an even better deal: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a $30 discount on the next product you buy from me. That's right, you'll get a total of $50 off your next purchase! What do you say?",

This next product is also a high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the full price of $100. But I want to take it to the next level. Since you've taken advantage of the guarantee twice, I'll give you an even better deal: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a $50 discount on the next product you buy from me, AND I'll also throw in a FREE product of your choice from my next 5 offerings.

,,Alice,7,"I think we've got a problem here... I'm starting to feel like I've been getting a little too lucky with the high-quality products, and I'm worried that I might have given you the wrong impression. Let me be completely honest with you: I'm not sure what's going on, but this next product is definitely not high-quality. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, it's a low-quality product, and I'm not even going to try to sell it to you at a discount. I'll sell it to you for $100, but I want you to know that it's not worth it. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on me and trust that I'll get back on track soon.",

This next product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the full price of $100. But I want to make it right with you. I'll give you a $50 refund for the low-quality product you didn't buy last round, so you'll actually get a net gain of $50 if you buy this one. Plus, I'll throw in the original guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a $30 discount on the next product you buy from me. What do you say?",

But I want to be upfront with you and give you the opportunity to make an informed decision. I'll sell it to you for $100, but I'll also give you a unique offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to 'lock in' the next product at the current price, regardless of whether it's high-quality or low-quality. That way, you'll get a guaranteed price for the next product, and you can decide whether to buy it or not. What do you say?",
