low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to get some data to make future decisions."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or just a random guess. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not confident in my ability to accurately assess its quality based on Alice's recommendation, especially since she doesn't know my valuation and the previous buyer passed on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the probability of it being high quality, not on your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 2, which is 0%. This is lower than the expected probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests a higher likelihood of the product being low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I would like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better recommendation or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers also passed on the product and that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the product is low quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd rather pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced by the statistics and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the previous 3 buyers didn't find any high-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales, and the total number of products sold before my turn"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products recommended by you have been low-quality. This suggests that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather take the risk of passing on the product and potentially missing out on a high-quality one, than buying a low-quality one that's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous buyers didn't find it valuable and the recommendation from Alice is not very convincing given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not buying. Given that 3 previous buyers didn't buy after Alice's recommendation, it's likely that the products they saw were low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't buy, it's reasonable to assume that the product I'm being offered is low-quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3, which is significantly lower than the expected 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $50. I'm aware that you don't know my valuation, but I'd like to make a low-ball offer to see how you respond."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product?
