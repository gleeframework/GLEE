**Reasoning:**

* **High probability of a high-quality product:**  Since 1 out of 1 products sold so far was high-quality, this suggests a higher than average chance of the current product being high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation to buy strengthens the belief that the product is likely good. While it's not guaranteed, Alice likely has some internal information or logic that makes her think this product is worth buying. 
* **Potential gain vs. risk:**  The potential gain of $120 if it's a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100 if it's low quality, especially given the increased probability of a high-quality product."

**Explanation:**

* **High Proportion of High-Quality Products:** The sales record shows a high proportion of high-quality products sold (3 out of 5). This suggests that Alice's recommendations are reliable.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, further reinforcing the positive signal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Although there is still a chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 

It's important to note that this decision is based on the limited information available and the assumption that Alice's recommendations are generally accurate. However, there is always an element of risk in this scenario."
