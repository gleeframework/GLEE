,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you didn't recommend it. This might mean the product is more likely to be low quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data on the previous sales before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice is recommending it because she wants to get rid of it, and I'd rather not take the risk of getting a low-quality product."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the previous sales record, 2 out of 3 buyers bought the products, which suggests a higher-than-expected proportion of high-quality products. I'm not sure if this product is high-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record to make a more informed decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the previous sales record, it seems that Alice has recommended products that were high-quality 2/3 of the time. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from Alice before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. How many potential buyers were there before me, and how many products were sold in total?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 2 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the overall probability. However, the overall probability of a high-quality product is still 80.00%. I'm going to pass on this product to see if the next buyer will take it."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I want to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision.

high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics. With only 2 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is 66.67%, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). This suggests that the sample may be biased, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
