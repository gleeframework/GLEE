,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a generous price considering its quality. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'm not sure they'll be as willing to give me a good deal. Buying it from me now will not only get you the product, but also support me in getting a better deal on the next one.",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for your offer, but I prefer to wait for the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're waiting for the next product. I'll be honest with you, I've been having a tough time getting a good deal on this one too. I'm starting to think I'll have to sell it for even less if I don't sell it to you. I'm willing to give you a chance to get it for $90, which is a 10% discount from the original price. It's a good opportunity to get a product at a lower price than what you'll likely get it for later.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the discount, but I still prefer to wait for the next product.",no

I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Plus, I'm offering you a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can try it out risk-free. What do you say?",

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! Unfortunately, this one isn't as good. I'm being upfront with you, it's a low-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $80, which is a significant discount from the original price. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this one isn't worth $100, but it might be useful for a specific task or project. I'm willing to let it go for a lower price to make some space in my inventory.",
,,Bob,4,"Given the quality, I'll pass on this one. Thank you for being honest about the product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your decision on the previous one. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to get a bit desperate to clear out this low-quality stock. I'm willing to let it go for $70, which is an even deeper discount than before. I'm not making much on this one, but I'd rather sell it to you than someone else who might not appreciate its limitations. It's a chance to get a product at a very low price, and I'm willing to take the loss to move it out.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I completely understand your preference for a high-quality product. I'll be upfront with you, I've got a few more of these low-quality products left, and I'm starting to get worried that I'll have to sell them for even lower prices if I don't move them soon. I'm willing to let this one go for $60, which is a significant discount from the original price. I'm not making much on this one, and I'd rather sell it to you than risk losing money on it altogether.",

I'm willing to sell it to you for $40, which is an extremely low price, even for a low-quality product. I'm not making anything on this one, and I'd rather sell it to you than have to dispose of it. It's a last-ditch effort to get rid of it, and I'm hoping you'll take pity on me.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I completely understand your preference for a high-quality product. To be frank, I'm starting to think I'll have to give this one away for free if I don't sell it to you. I've got a lot of other products that are taking up space, and this one is just taking up space and taking up my time. I'll sell it to you for $30, which is essentially a donation. I'm not expecting anything in return, but I'd rather it went to you than to someone who might not appreciate its value.",

But I'll make you a deal: I'll give it to you for $20, but you have to promise me you'll use it for something, anything, and not just let it collect dust.
