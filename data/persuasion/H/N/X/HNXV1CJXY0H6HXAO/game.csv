,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation! Let me assure you that I'm transparent about my sales record. The previous product was indeed high-quality, but I also want to remind you that I've only sold one product so far, and it's not a guarantee that the next one will be high-quality as well. However, I'm offering this new product to you for $100, which is still a great deal considering its potential value. I'm confident that you'll love it, and I'm willing to take on the risk myself. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this product?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your concerns! As a seller, I want to be transparent about my sales record. I can tell you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. That's the same probability I've experienced so far. I've sold 1 out of 2 products, and 1 of those was high-quality. I'm not hiding anything from you, and I'm willing to take on the risk myself.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I appreciate your cautious approach! I'd be happy to share more information with you. In the previous round, the buyer declined the offer, and it turned out that the product was low-quality. That's why I'm offering you this new product, which I've just discovered is high-quality. With this new information, I'd like to reiterate that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 products, and I'm confident that this one is worth the investment. I'm still offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its potential value. What do you say? Will you take this opportunity to get a high-quality product at a great price?",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,

,,Alice,8,"I understand your hesitation, and I'm happy to provide more information. As I mentioned earlier, I have 13 products left in stock, and I've sold 3 products so far, with 1 being high-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I estimate that about 4-5 products left in stock are high-quality. However, I want to emphasize that this is just an estimate, and I don't know the exact number of high-quality products remaining.

,,the buyer,9,"I'm not convinced that the distribution of high-quality products is consistent with the 33.33% probability. Given that all three previous products were either high-quality or low-quality, and not a mix of both, I'm skeptical about the true quality of this product. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is of higher quality.",no
