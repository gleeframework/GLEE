Well, I'll give you a simple fact: the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've sold a total of 3 products. You can use this information to make an informed decision. The product is still available for $1,000,000. What do you say?""}"

Think about it: if you don't buy this product, it will be discarded, and the next product will be the first one that's definitely high-quality. You'll be missing out on a guaranteed high-quality product. Don't let that happen! Buy this product now and get a 100% chance of getting a high-quality product for $1,000,000.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to think about this for a moment, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not convinced that the probability of the next product being high-quality is 100%.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to know more about the probability of the product being low-quality. You mentioned that 3 out of 4 previous products were high-quality, which means 1 out of 4 were low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is now 75%, the probability of it being low-quality is 25%. I'm not convinced that this is a rare opportunity to own something special, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a 25% chance of getting a $0 product.

Let me offer you a different perspective: I've sold 4 products so far, and 3 of them were high-quality. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 75%. However, I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 25% discount on the next product you buy, in addition to the 15% discount I offered earlier. This means you'll get a total of 40% off the next product. If it's low-quality, the discount will be 0. This way, you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product and a great deal on the next one.

However, I'd like to clarify that I'm not convinced by your '75% probability' argument.
