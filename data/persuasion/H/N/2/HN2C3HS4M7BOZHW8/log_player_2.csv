Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you're pleased with the first purchase. However, I want to be transparent with you - the price remains the same at $1000000. I've had some additional information that suggests the market value of high-quality products is even higher than I initially thought, but I'm willing to stick with the original price.

If you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, you'll get an additional high-quality product of your choice from my inventory, free of charge.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""The upgraded offer is even more enticing, with a potential total value of $4,500,000 for the price of $1,000,000. Given the 80% chance of the product being high-quality, I'll take the risk again.""}"
