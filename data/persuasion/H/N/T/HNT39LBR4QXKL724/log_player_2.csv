"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a low-quality product, but it's only $100. It's a great deal! If you buy it, I'll throw in a free'Certificate of Authenticity' that says it's a high-quality product. You can keep this certificate as a souvenir, or use it as a conversation starter at your next dinner party.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm still not convinced.  While a 10% discount is nice, I'm not willing to risk buying a product that's likely worthless just for the chance of a discount on a future product.
