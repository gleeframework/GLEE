Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! You want to do your research. Let me give you the sales record so far: 0 out of 2 products sold, both of which were low-quality. I'm confident that the next one will be a winner, though! It's a great chance to get in on the ground floor of a potentially amazing deal. Would you like to take a chance on it for $100?

Alice's message: Fair question! Let me assure you, I source my products from a variety of suppliers, and I don't have any control over their quality. I'm just a middleman trying to make a sale. But I will say that I'm a transparent seller, and I'll keep you updated on the sales record as we go along. Currently, 0 out of 3 products sold, all of which were low-quality. Still a great opportunity to get in on the deal for $100, if you're willing to take the risk!

Alice's message: Great attitude! You're a true risk-taker! Unfortunately, it looks like our winning streak is over. The product I have for you now is not as fortunate as the last one. 1 out of 4 products sold, and this one is unfortunately low-quality. Still, I'm willing to let you in on a little secret: I've got a feeling that the next one might be the real deal. Would you like to take a chance on it for $100?

Alice's message: You're a cautious one, I like that! I won't blame you for being skeptical after the last two low-quality products. But let me put it this way: I've sold 1 out of 5 products so far, and I'm starting to think that the next one might just be the one that breaks the streak. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, just for you: $90 for this one. It's a steal, if I do say so myself!

Alice's message: Fair question! I don't have any inside information about the quality of this product, but I can tell you that I've been in the business long enough to know that sometimes you just need to take a chance. I'm not making any promises, but I will say that this product has been on the shelf for a bit longer than the others, and I'm starting to think that it might be a hidden gem. I'll let you in on a little secret: I've sold 1 out of 6 products so far, and I'm starting to feel a bit of pressure to break the streak. Would you like to take a chance on it for $100?

Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, I like that! Let me give you the sales record so far: 1 out of 7 products sold, and I'm happy to report that the one I sold was indeed high-quality! That means that 1 out of 7 products sold was high-quality, which is actually a bit higher than the expected 50% chance. Maybe I'm getting the hang of this!

Alice's message: You're a cautious one, I respect that! I won't pressure you into buying something you're not comfortable with.

That's a 25% chance of getting a high-quality product in the last three draws, which is still a bit lower than the expected 50% chance. However, I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a special 'confidence boost' - if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product I sell, regardless of its quality.
