Alice's message: You've probably heard that I've sold one high-quality product so far. But let me ask you, do you really think that's a reliable indicator of the product's quality? I've sold 1 out of 1 product so far, and it just so happens to be high-quality. Maybe I'm just on a hot streak? Or maybe it was just luck. You don't know what the next product will be. And even if you do buy this one, you'll only be out $10000 if it's low-quality. But if it is high-quality, you'll be getting a great deal. The odds are still 1 in 3, but I think you'll find that this product is worth the risk. What do you say?
