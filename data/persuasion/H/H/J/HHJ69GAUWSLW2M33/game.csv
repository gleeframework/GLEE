,,Alice,1,"Greetings! I'm offering a unique opportunity to acquire a product for $1000000. While I can't disclose the specific quality, it's worth noting that  historically, approximately one-third of my products have been high-quality. This is a chance to potentially secure a valuable asset. What are your thoughts?",

While I cannot reveal the specific quality, I can confirm that my previous sales history reflects a 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality. This represents a potentially significant investment opportunity. Are you interested in learning more?",
,,the buyer,2,"Since there are no previous sales and the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, the expected value is $416667 ($1250000 * 0.3333), which is less than the asking price of $1000000. I'll pass on this one.",no
