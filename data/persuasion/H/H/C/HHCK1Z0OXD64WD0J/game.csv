This way, you'll be able to cut your losses and move on.",

If you buy it, I'll provide you with a detailed plan on how to repurpose or resell it, so you can minimize your losses.",

I'll bundle it with a high-quality product that I'll offer you in the next round, and you can buy both for a discounted price.

If you buy this lot, you'll get the high-quality product for $3500000 and the low-quality product for free.",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the offer for the lot deal, but given the history of low-quality products, I prefer to focus on acquiring high-quality products individually. I'll pass on this offer to ensure that my investments are aligned with my quality standards.",no

,,Bob,13,"I appreciate the effort to resolve the situation, but my focus remains on acquiring high-quality products. The offer to receive a $500000 refund doesn't change my decision to pass on this low-quality product, as it doesn't align with my quality standards and investment preferences.",no
