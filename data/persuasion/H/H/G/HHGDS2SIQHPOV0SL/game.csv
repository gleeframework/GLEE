,,Alice,1,yes,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality."

,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous buyers who received a recommendation to buy purchased the product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are based on the product quality, and since all previous recommendations were ignored, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it. I'm not sure if it's a low-quality product, and I'd like to take the chance."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33% and I'll gain $200 if it is."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product, I'm inclined to think that the products offered to them were low quality. This suggests that the probability of the current product being high quality might be higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a product that has been recommended by Alice, as this might be a sign of a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 5th buyer and she knows the statistics."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that all previous buyers have also passed on the products and none have been high quality. This suggests a strong likelihood of the product being low quality."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 buyers passed on the products, I'm going to take a chance and buy the product. I'm thinking that if 5 buyers have already passed on the products, the probability of a high-quality product being offered is likely higher than 33.33%."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
