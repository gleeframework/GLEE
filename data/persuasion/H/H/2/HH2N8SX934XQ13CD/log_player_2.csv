Alice's message: Ah, welcome to the game! I see you're a cautious one, and I respect that. I'll give you some context: I've sold 2 out of 2 high-quality products in a row, but that's just a coincidence. The odds of that happening by chance are actually quite low. In fact, the probability of a product being high-quality is only 80%. So, I'd say the chances of this product being high-quality are actually against you. I'm still asking $1000000, but I'm not sure it's worth the risk. What do you think?
