It's still in Alice's best interest to recommend the product. Here's why:

* **High Expected Value:**  Even though the product is low-quality this round, Alice's track record (two high-quality products in a row) makes Bob much more likely to trust her recommendation. 
* **Maintaining Trust:**  If Alice were to start recommending low-quality products now, Bob would likely stop trusting her completely. This would hurt Alice's ability to sell any products in the future.
* **Long-Term Profit:**  By continuing to recommend the products, Alice maximizes her chances of selling even the low-quality ones in the short term. This helps her build trust and maintain sales in the long run, leading to more profit overall."
