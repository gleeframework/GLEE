"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first product. If you buy it, I'll give you a 50% chance to get a product worth $400. If you decline, I'll offer you another product, and we'll start again. What do you think is the expected value of this product?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take the chance and buy the current product.""}"

Round 2
Alice's message: You took a chance and didn't get a $400 product. Since the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, it's likely that the next product will be worth $400. If you buy now, you'll get to take another shot at the $400 product. If you decline, you'll have to wait another round to potentially get the high-quality product. What's your decision?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take another chance and buy the current product, hoping to get the high-quality one this time.""}"

I'll let you in on a secret: the probability of getting a high-quality product in the next round is still 50%. However, I'll offer you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to inspect the next product before buying it. You can see its quality before deciding whether to buy it. What do you think is the value of this offer?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm tempted by the offer, but I think it's still a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. I'll take the chance and buy the current product, hoping to get the high-quality one.""}"

However, I'll give you a hint: the next product is not the one you'll get to inspect before buying. If you buy this product, you'll have to wait until the next round to see if you get the inspectable product.
