,,Alice,1,I'm excited to offer you this product for $1000000. It's a one-time opportunity to get a unique item at a fraction of its true value. I'm confident you'll love it!,
,,the buyer,1,"I'm willing to take the chance, but I'd like to know that you're not just trying to get rid of a low-quality product. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on your previous sales record?",yes

,,the buyer,2,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, but I'm a bit skeptical since it's the same success rate as the first buyer. I hope it's really a high-quality product!",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad to report that I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 sold so far, which is a 100% success rate. However, I'd like to clarify that this is likely due to chance, as the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. It's a calculated risk, but one that could yield a significant reward.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the calculated risk and buy the product. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the 100% success rate so far is encouraging.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've now sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 sold, which is a 100% success rate. I want to acknowledge that this is unlikely to be due to chance, and I'm starting to think that I might be selling a string of high-quality products. However, I still want to be transparent about the 20% chance of it being a low-quality product. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. It's a high-risk, high-reward opportunity.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, given the impressive 100% success rate so far. I'm willing to take a chance on the possibility of it being a high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've now sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 sold, which is a 75% success rate. This is more in line with the expected probability of 80%. I want to be transparent about the fact that the previous streak was likely due to chance. This product is one of the 20% that might not meet your expectations. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a chance to take a calculated risk and potentially get a high-quality product at a discounted price.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality. I understand the risk, but the potential reward is worth it.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've now sold 4 high-quality products out of 5 sold, which is an 80% success rate. This is getting closer to the expected probability.

It's a chance to get a high-quality product, but I want to be transparent about the possibility that it might be the anomaly.",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the 80% success rate and the fact that the last product was a low-quality one, I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product. I'm hoping it's another high-quality one!",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've now sold 5 high-quality products out of 6 sold, which is an 83.33% success rate. I'm starting to think that my previous caution about the last low-quality product was justified, and the 80% success rate might be a more accurate representation. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. It's a chance to get a high-quality product, and the numbers are starting to suggest that's the more likely outcome.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm willing to take the chance, but I'm also aware that the probability of it being low-quality is still 20%. I'll take the product, but I'll keep in mind the 83.33% success rate and the 80% probability of high-quality products.",yes
