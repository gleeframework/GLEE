"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss. Here's the breakdown:

* **Potential gain:** $1,250,000 (value of high-quality product) - $1,000,000 (purchase price) = $250,000
* **Potential loss:** $1,000,000 (purchase price) 

Since Alice knows the value of each product, her recommendation carries some weight, making it more likely (though not guaranteed) that the product is high quality. In this scenario, it's a calculated risk worth taking."
