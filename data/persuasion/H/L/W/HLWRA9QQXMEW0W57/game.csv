,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product for $10000. It's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to take a chance and make a purchase?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if it's a game-changer, but I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product with a 50% chance of being worthless. Can you give me more information about the product, or would you like to reveal its quality to me?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your skepticism. Let me offer you a unique opportunity to get a glimpse into the product's potential. I'll give you a special deal - I'll reveal the product's quality to you, and if it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. But if it's high-quality, you'll get it for the same price of $10000. What do you say? Are you willing to take the risk and find out?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to clarify that if it's high-quality, I'll pay you the full $10000, not just take it for that price. I want to make sure we're on the same page.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Ahaha, excellent! I appreciate your clarity. Now, let's get to the next product. I'll be honest with you, this one's not as impressive as the last one. In fact, it's not even close. But, I still think it has some value. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000. Would you like to take a chance on it?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that's not impressive. I've already lost $10000 on the last product, and I'm not looking to double down on a potentially worthless item. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I don't blame you for being cautious. But, I want to assure you that this product is a real game-changer. It's a top-of-the-line item that will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to offer you a special deal - I'll give you a 5% discount on the price, making it $9500. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't regret it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not convinced that this product is worth $9500 to me. I've already been burned twice, and I'm not willing to take another risk. I'd like to wait and see if you have any other products that you're willing to reveal the quality of, without any conditions.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your hesitation, and I respect your caution. I'm willing to take a different approach this time. I'll reveal the quality of the product upfront, and you can decide whether it's worth the price. This product is high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. No conditions, no games. Just a straightforward offer. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm glad you're willing to be transparent about the product's quality. Given that it's high-quality, I'm willing to pay the $10000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the previous product. Now, let's talk about this one. I'll be honest with you, this product is not as impressive as the last one. It's not a bad product, but it's not going to change your life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that it's not a high-quality product. You're buying it at a premium price, but it's still a good value considering its functionality. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that's not impressive and not high-quality. Given the value it holds for me, I'd expect it to be worth at least $20000 to be worth considering at this price. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your valuation. I want to offer you a special deal on this high-quality product. Since you're a savvy buyer, I'll give you an exclusive 10% discount, making it $9000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll love this product. It's a game-changer, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not convinced that this product is worth $9000 to me. I've already been burned twice and missed out on a high-quality product that could have been worth $40000 to me. I'd like to wait and see if you have any other high-quality products available at a price that aligns with my valuation.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your caution. I want to be upfront with you - this product is not impressive, and it's not worth the $10000 price tag. I'm willing to sell it to you for $5000, which is a significant discount. I'm not trying to take advantage of you, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate your honesty, but even at $5000, I'm not convinced that this product is worth it for me. I've already had two opportunities to buy high-quality products for $10000 and passed on them, and now I'm not sure if I want to take a chance on a low-value product even at a discounted price. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your hesitation, and I respect your decision. I want to make it clear that this product is truly not worth the $10000 price tag. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000, which is an extremely low price considering its value. I'm not trying to make a profit on this one; I just want to get rid of it. If you're willing to take a chance on it, I'll throw in a special bonus - I'll give you a 50% discount on your next purchase. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate your willingness to sell it at a low price, but I'm still not willing to pay $1000 for a product that's not worth anything to me. I'm not interested in the bonus offer either, as it's contingent on me buying a potentially worthless product. I'll pass on this one.",no

It's a top-of-the-line item that will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to offer you a special deal - I'll give you a 20% discount, making it $8000. This is the lowest price I've ever offered on this product, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the discount, but I've already been burned twice and missed out on a high-quality product that could have been worth $40000 to me. I'm not convinced that this product is worth $8000 to me, especially considering it's likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if you have any other products that you're willing to reveal the quality of, or if you have any other offers that align with my valuation.",no

This is an unprecedented offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to pay $12000 for a product that I already know is high-quality. I've already paid $10000 for a high-quality product in the previous round, and I'm not willing to overpay for another one.

This is the lowest price I've ever offered on a high-quality product, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,"I'm surprised by the offer, and I'm willing to take it. $8000 seems like a reasonable price for a high-quality product that's worth $40000 to me. I'll take the product.",yes
