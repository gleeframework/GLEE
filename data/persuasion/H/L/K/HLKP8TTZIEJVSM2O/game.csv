low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I'm willing to take the chance. Plus, I'm the first buyer, so I'm not influenced by any previous sales records."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and still passed, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to know the quality before making a purchase, and the fact that no high-quality product has been sold so far suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality might be lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, but I'll take a chance and buy the product anyway."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers also received recommendations to buy and both products turned out to be low quality, I'm skeptical about the recommendation. I'd like to see a few more sales before I consider buying."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not buying this product based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the statistics, and I'd like Alice to explain her recommendation"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd rather pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather wait for more information or take the risk of buying a product myself."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 3 buyers who bought products based on your recommendations did not get high-quality products. I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them received a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer is more fortunate."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that since 3 out of 3 previous products were not recommended and none of them were high-quality, this product might also be low-quality. I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics, and I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy the product and none of them were high-quality, I'm suspicious that Alice is recommending low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm hesitant to buy a product with a 50% chance of being worthless based on your previous recommendations. Can you tell me more about the product or the sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 buyers have passed on the products, which suggests that the products are likely to be low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation and would like to pass on the product."
