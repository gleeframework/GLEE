``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **The prior information is weak:**  The fact that only one other buyer purchased a product and it was high-quality is not enough to draw strong conclusions about the current product.
* **Alice's recommendation is valuable:** Alice has seen the product and likely has some insight into its quality.  While not foolproof, her recommendation is worth considering.
* **The potential payoff outweighs the risk:**  A high-quality product is worth $300, which is a significant gain.  Even if the product is low-quality, the loss is only $100.

**Therefore, taking a chance and buying the product seems like the best option in this scenario.**"

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:**  2 out of 2 products sold were high quality, indicating a 100% success rate based on Alice's recommendations.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product strengthens the case for buying. 
* **Potential Gain:** Even if there's a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($300) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one ($0).

It's a calculated risk, but the available information strongly suggests the product is likely to be high quality."
