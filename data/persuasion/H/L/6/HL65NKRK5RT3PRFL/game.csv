,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I just bought two low-quality products in a row, and Alice is now recommending a product. I'm going to assume she's recommending a high-quality product, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,

,,Bob,15,no,"I've bought four high-quality products in a row now, and the probability of this being a high-quality product is actually lower than I thought. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I was wrong again! I thought I was due for a low-quality product, but I got another high-quality one. I'll take a chance and buy this one, hoping my luck holds out, but I'm starting to get suspicious that Alice is somehow influencing the quality of the products she recommends."
