Are you ready to take the leap and make it yours?",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'd like to take a more calculated approach. With an 83% success rate, I'd expect the probability of this product being high-quality to be around 83%. However, I know that the true probability is actually 80%. I'd like to calculate the expected value of this product, taking into account the 20% chance it might be low-quality. If I do the math, I get an expected value of around $8000.

However, I'd like to remind you that this product is not just about the probability of it being high-quality, but also about the potential upside. Think about it, if this product is indeed high-quality, it's worth $30000 to you.

Plus, I'm willing to offer you a special guarantee: if this product is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and a personalized apology. What do you say? Are you ready to take the chance and make it yours?",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your guarantee and the potential upside, but I'd like to calculate the expected value again. With a 20% chance of it being low-quality, the expected value is indeed $8000. However, I'd like to consider the possibility of Alice's guarantee being a signal that the product is actually low-quality. If that's the case, it might be a red flag. I'll take a chance and buy the product, but I'll keep an eye out for any potential flaws.",yes

I'd also appreciate it if you could share the exact number of high-quality products sold in the last 5 sales.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Ahah, you're a data-driven decision maker, I love it! I understand your request, and I'm happy to provide you with the exact numbers.

However, I'd like to remind you that past performance is not a guarantee of future results. This product is a unique opportunity, and I'm confident that it will exceed your expectations.

,,the buyer,11,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'd like to make an informed decision. Given the 80% probability of high-quality products and the recent 4 out of 5 high-quality products in the last 5 sales, I'll calculate the expected value of the product. The expected value of a high-quality product is $30000, and the expected value of a low-quality product is $0. Since the probability of high-quality products is 80%, the expected value of the product is (0.8 * $30000) + (0.2 * $0) = $24000. Since I'm paying $10000, I'm essentially getting a discount of $14000. Considering the potential loss of $6000 if the product is low-quality, I'm willing to take the risk. I'll take the chance and buy the product.",yes

,,the buyer,12,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'd like to think critically about this offer. With only 6 out of 8 buyers getting high-quality products, I'm not convinced that the expected value is $24000. I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision.",yes
