We're thrilled to offer you this new item, and we're happy to report that our first customer loved their experience with us. Since you're our second customer, we'd like to share some insights about our sales record so far. We've sold one product, and unfortunately, it was a low-quality item. However, we're confident that our second product is of high quality, given the random nature of our product distribution. We're willing to offer this high-quality product to you for the same price of $100. Will you take advantage of this opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fixed price?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take my chances. The product's quality is independent of the first buyer's outcome. Given that there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product and it's worth $300 to me, the expected value ($150) is greater than the cost ($100).

However, we'd like to remind you that our sales record is now heavily skewed towards high-quality products, which might make you question the true probability of the product's quality. Will you take advantage of this opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fixed price, or will you wait for a more balanced sales record?""}"
"The buyer's message: I've noticed that the sales record is indeed heavily skewed towards high-quality products. Given the original 50% probability of a product being high-quality and the fact that the first 3 products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that the next product is more likely to be low-quality to balance out the probability.

Our sales record is now 4 high-quality products out of 4 products sold, which is an extremely unusual occurrence.
