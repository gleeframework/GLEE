,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to get a unique product at a steal! I'm offering it to you for $1000000, a price that's almost too good to be true. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you at this price. What do you say, are you ready to make a deal?",
,,Bob,1,"Since I have no information about the true quality of the product, I will not buy it this round.",no

That's right, you'll get two high-quality products for the price of one! What do you say, are you ready to take advantage of this incredible offer?",
