Alice's message: You're being cautious, and that's a smart move! You want to see more data before making a decision. I respect that. Let me give you some more information: out of the 2 products I've sold so far, 2 are high-quality. That's a 100% success rate! Does that change your mind? The price remains the same at $100, but the odds of getting a high-quality product are looking pretty good right now.

Alice's message: You're a true statistician, aren't you? You're not swayed by the streak, but instead, you're focusing on the underlying probability of the product being high-quality. I respect that.
