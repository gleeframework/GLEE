"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice doesn't know Bob's valuation of high-quality and low-quality products, and the price is fixed, there's no way to predict whether Bob will get a good deal or not.  However, the information that the product is high-quality is valuable. 

As Bob knows there's a 50% chance of a high-quality product, and he now has this information, it's reasonable to recommend buying the product.  He is in a better position to make a decision knowing the product is high-quality."
