Alice's message: I completely understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your thoughtful approach. To provide more context, the two previous products I sold were one high-quality product and one low-quality product. I'm glad you asked for more information, and I'm happy to provide it. Given that we've had one high-quality product out of two, it's likely that the next product will be low-quality. But, I'm here to tell you that this one is indeed high-quality! It's a rare gem, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy it, I'll reveal the quality of the next product to you, so you can make an informed decision for your next purchase.

Since we've had two sales so far, and one of them was high-quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually 50%, not lower. I'm not trying to deceive you; I'm just providing the facts. This product, however, is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000.

Alice's message: I'm glad you took a chance and bought the previous product! Unfortunately, it seems that this one is not as lucky. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm being transparent about the product's quality. I've sold 3 products so far, and 2 of them were high-quality. The law of large numbers is in effect, and it's likely that the next product will be high-quality as well. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $1000000, but I'll throw in a unique opportunity: if you buy it, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product, regardless of its quality. That's a $100000 savings if the next product is high-quality! What do you think?

Alice's message: I understand your desire for more information, and I'm happy to provide some context. As it turns out, the distribution of high-quality products is not random, but rather follows a binomial distribution. With 3 products sold so far, the expected number of high-quality products is 1.5, and the variance is 0.75. Given that we've had 2 high-quality products, it's actually more likely that the next product will be low-quality, as the observed number of high-quality products is 2, which is 1 standard deviation above the mean. This product, unfortunately, is not high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, and I'll throw in a 'priority access' to the next product, so you'll be the first in line to buy it.

Alice's message: I completely understand your decision, and I respect your cautious approach. I'm glad you're willing to wait for the next product and take advantage of the priority access. As a matter of fact, I'll make you an offer: since you're willing to wait, I'll give you a 'pre-approval' for the next product, so you'll be the first to know when it's available. If the next product is high-quality, I'll give you a 5% discount on the price, making it $950000.
