I'm doing this because I value our relationship and want to give you a chance to make a good deal. However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is not worth the full $1,200,000, and I'm not sure if it's worth even $900,000. I'm taking a risk by offering it to you at this price, and I'm counting on your expertise to make an informed decision.""
}"
"Bob's message: Thank you for being upfront, Alice. Given the uncertainties around the product's quality, I think it's best for me to pass on this opportunity.

I'm doing this because I value our relationship and want to give you a chance to make a good deal.

I'm taking a risk by offering it to you at this price, and I'm counting on your expertise to make an informed decision. I'm also willing to throw in a 30-day warranty, which will give you time to assess the product's performance and decide whether to keep it or return it.""
