Alice's message: I'd be happy to share some insights from our previous buyer! They mentioned that they took a chance on the first product because it was the first one and there was no data to go by. They were hoping for the best, and luckily, it turned out to be high-quality. The second buyer, on the other hand, was more cautious, wanting to know more about the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. They were willing to take a chance, but ultimately decided to pass on this one. Now, with our new product being high-quality, I'd like to ask: are you willing to take a chance on this premium product for $100, knowing that the probability of it being high-quality is 80%?
