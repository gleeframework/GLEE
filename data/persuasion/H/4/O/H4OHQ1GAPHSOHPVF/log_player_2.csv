Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no prior information about product quality (as no sales have happened yet),  the recommendation from Alice is the only information available.  While there's a higher chance of the product being low quality, it's still worth taking the risk as a high-quality product would result in a significant gain ($125). It's essentially a gamble with a potential for a good reward."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in our favor:**  Even though the product has a higher chance of being low quality, we know that Alice has already sold one high-quality product. This means that she's likely to have a better sense of which products are high quality.  
* **We have nothing to lose:** If we buy the product and it's low quality, we lose $100. But if it's high quality, we make a profit of $25.  
* **Alice's recommendation:** While her recommendation isn't a guarantee, it gives us additional confidence that the product might be worth buying.

**Important Note:** This is a risky decision, and it's possible to lose money.  However, the information provided and Alice's recommendation make it a slightly more calculated risk."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Probability:** The initial probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product and recommends buying it. This is valuable information, especially considering she has a strong incentive to sell high-quality products to maintain her reputation.
* **Past Sales Data:**  The fact that 2 out of 2 previous sales were high-quality products strongly suggests a pattern of selling high-quality items.

**While there's still a chance the product is low quality, the information available makes buying a much more attractive option than passing.**"
