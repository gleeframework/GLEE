I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing the best possible experience. However, I do want to mention that the last product I sold was a great opportunity, and I'm not sure if this next one will be as valuable. The price remains the same at $1000000.

I want to assure you that I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products sold, and the last one was just sold.

It's possible that I've just been extremely lucky, or maybe there's something special about my products. The price remains the same at $1000000.

I'm not trying to hide anything, but I do want to point out that the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and I've already sold 5 out of 5.

I want to be upfront with you: at this point, it's getting suspiciously consistent. I'm not trying to deceive you, but I want to acknowledge that the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and I've sold 7 out of 7.
