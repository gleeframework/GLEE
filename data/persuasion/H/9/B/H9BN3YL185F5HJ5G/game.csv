,,Alice,1,"I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and this one is definitely not high-quality. I'm willing to offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a refund if I sell a high-quality product in the next round. This is a one-time offer, and you won't get a refund if you don't buy this product.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I've sold 1 product so far, and both of them were low-quality. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I've had no high-quality sales yet. If you're feeling lucky, this might be a good opportunity to take a chance on a potentially valuable product.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the information. Given the low-quality sales history and the high-quality product probability, I believe this could be an interesting opportunity. I'll take a chance on the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 low-quality products so far, and the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I want to offer you a different perspective: if I had sold a high-quality product by now, I would have already sold one, given the probability. Since I haven't, it's possible that the high-quality products are just not coming up in the sales. You can decide whether to take a chance on this low-quality product or wait for the next round.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the insight. Given the statistics and the uncertainty, I choose to pass on this product and wait for the next opportunity.",no

I know you passed on the previous low-quality product, so I want to make a special offer to you. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a guarantee: if you ever encounter a low-quality product in the future, I'll give you a refund for that one as well. This is a one-time offer, and you won't get a refund for any other low-quality products.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and 3 low-quality products. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I've now sold 3 low-quality products out of 4 total, which is a significant skew. I'm willing to offer you a deal: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 50% refund if I sell another high-quality product in the next round. This way, you can potentially recoup some of your investment if I'm lucky again.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 4 low-quality products so far. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the odds are against me, it seems. I want to be transparent with you: I'm not sure what's going on, but it's possible that I've just had a streak of bad luck. I'm willing to offer you a'reverse guarantee': if you buy this low-quality product and I sell another high-quality product in the next round, I'll give you a chance to buy that one for $500000 instead of the usual $1000000.",
