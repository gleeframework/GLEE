"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know the product is high-quality. While you don't know Bob's exact valuation for a high-quality product, it's reasonable to assume it's worth more than $10,000, given the 33.33% probability of it being high-quality. 

Therefore, recommending Bob to buy the product is the best course of action in this round, as it's likely to result in a profitable transaction for both of you."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You know the product is low-quality in this round.  It's unlikely that Bob would value a low-quality product at $10,000, considering the 33.33% chance of it being high-quality. Recommending the purchase would likely result in a loss for Bob and damage your reputation as a trustworthy seller. Therefore, it's best to decline recommending the purchase in this round."
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty.  Since you're not recommending it, I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though you don't know Bob's exact valuation for low-quality products, it's highly unlikely he'd be willing to pay $10,000 for one, especially after declining the previous low-quality product. Continuing to recommend low-quality products would likely damage your reputation and make future transactions less likely.  It's better to be honest and let Bob know this particular product isn't worth the price."
"Bob's message: Alice, you've been accurate so far.  I'm going to trust your judgment and pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

* **Bob values high-quality products:** He bought the first high-quality product, demonstrating that he recognizes their value. 
* **Bob trusts your judgment:** He's consistently acknowledged and respected your honesty in declining to recommend low-quality products. 

Therefore, recommending this high-quality product is likely to be successful.  Bob trusts your assessment and is likely willing to take a chance, especially given his past experience with a profitable high-quality purchase."
