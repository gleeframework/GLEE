,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product for $10000. I want to assure you that this is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll find it valuable. However, I also want to be transparent with you - I've had some experience with this product, and I've found it to be... underwhelming. But I believe that with the right buyer, it could still be a good fit. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate your transparency, but based on your description of the product as 'underwhelming', I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000.",no

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you were willing to take a chance on the previous product! I want to be upfront with you again - this next product is not as impressive as the last one. In fact, I'd say it's one of the weaker ones I have. However, I'm willing to offer it to you at the same price as before, $10000. I'm hoping that you'll be able to see past its flaws and recognize the potential value it could bring to your business. I'm willing to make a special deal with you - if you buy this product, I'll throw in a free consultation to help you get the most out of it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your honesty again, but I'm not convinced that the product's potential value outweighs its flaws, especially considering the same price point as before. The free consultation is a nice offer, but I don't think it's enough to justify the $10000 investment in a potentially low-quality product.",no

In fact, it's one of the weaker ones I have. I'm not going to offer a refund this time, but I am willing to make a concession on the price. I'll sell it to you for $5000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. I think it's a fair price considering the product's limitations. What do you say?",

,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the appeal to my altruistic side, but I'm afraid I have to prioritize my business goals.
