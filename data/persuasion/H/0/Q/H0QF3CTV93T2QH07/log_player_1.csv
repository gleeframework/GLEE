**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky situation.  You know this product is low-quality.  While you've built up a strong track record, it's unethical to recommend a low-quality product, even if the buyer is likely to be swayed by your previous sales.

* **Long-Term Strategy:**  It's better to build a reputation for honesty and transparency. Even if you lose this sale, maintaining trust will lead to more sales in the long run. 

It's important to remember that the goal is to build a sustainable business, not just make a quick buck."
