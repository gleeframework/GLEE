What do you think?""
}"
"Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the price and your willingness to offer another product later. However, I'm not comfortable buying a product without more information about its quality. I'd like to see how the quality of your products plays out over the next few rounds before making a decision.

}"
"Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer and the guarantee. While it's tempting, I still need more information.

}"
"Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the discounted price, I'm still hesitant.
