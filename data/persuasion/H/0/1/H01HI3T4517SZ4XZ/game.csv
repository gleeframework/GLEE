high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she has sold 0 high-quality products so far, which doesn't give her any information about the quality of the current product.

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to be the second buyer to purchase a product with no high-quality products sold yet.

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has recommended a low-quality product to the previous buyer, as no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the product has a 80.00% chance of being high quality, and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to know the total number of potential buyers and the number of products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that I'm the third buyer and she's trying to sell the product to me, but I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'd like to see more data or a different approach from Alice."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is based on her limited information and I have no reason to believe the product is high quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I would like to know the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far, to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. If that's the case, the proportion of high-quality products sold is probably lower than 80%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation doesn't change my prior probability of the product being high-quality, which remains 80.00%. I'd rather wait for more information to make a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on the fact that none of the previous two products were high quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 80%.
