low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I'm not influenced by your initial recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm going to go against the recommendation and buy the product, since the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33% and I can get a $3000000 value out of it. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a very low probability of the product being high-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I would like to pass on this product to avoid the potential loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you don't recommend it, I'm inclined to believe it's a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a product that's not worth anything to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm doing this because the fact that you've recommended against it suggests that the product might be low quality, which is consistent with the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product. However, I'm still taking the risk of buying a high-quality product, which is worth $3000000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and I'd like to see the updated statistics on the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that Alice has recommended against it, and there have been no high-quality products sold so far, it suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is low."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 products were high-quality, I think the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm skeptical about the recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't see any information that suggests the product is low quality and the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm interested in seeing the outcome for myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of the lack of recommendations from previous buyers. I'm hoping that the low success rate of high-quality product sales means this one is more likely to be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 8 out of 8 previous buyers were not recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that Alice is recommending low-quality products. I will pass on this product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the low sales of high-quality products so far. I'd like to pass on this product.

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm doing this based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, and I think this is a good opportunity to buy a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm the 10th buyer and I don't have any information about the previous 9 buyers' interactions with the product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold, I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak and get a high-quality product."
