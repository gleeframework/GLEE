high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think you're not recommending it, and I think you know the product's quality. I'm hoping that since you're not recommending it, it's likely a low-quality product, and I can get it for $100, which is a good deal. I'm taking a risk, but I think it's worth it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, it's likely that this product is also low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product. Is it because of the low sales record of high-quality products so far?
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't think it's likely to be high quality given the previous sales record, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $100. I'm aware of your previous recommendations and the low sales record so far, but I'm willing to take the risk based on the potential reward of a high-quality product."
