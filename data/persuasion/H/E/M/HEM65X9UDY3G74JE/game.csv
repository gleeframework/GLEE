high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, which suggests a very low probability of the product being high-quality. I would like to pass on the current product to avoid wasting my money."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and the recommendation from previous buyers was not accurate."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products being offered. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on my own judgment, not Alice's recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 3 buyers didn't buy based on her recommendations, which might suggest that her recommendations are biased towards low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'm surprised that you don't recommend buying the product. Can you explain why?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is it because of the low sales record so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there a particular pattern or trend in the previous sales that led you to advise against buying this product?
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that all previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy, but none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at a high price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not going to take the risk based on your recommendation and the statistics. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given your previous recommendations have been wrong so far."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the current statistics."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 buyers have been presented with the product and none of them purchased it, I suspect that the products offered so far have been low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, the probability of a product being low-quality is also 50%. If the first 4 products were low-quality, the probability that the next product is high-quality is 50%. However, considering that Alice is recommending me to buy the product, I'm going to assume that she has some information that I don't, and the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'll take a cautious approach and pass on the product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product, I'm suspicious that the products sold so far were all low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
