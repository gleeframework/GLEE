We've had a great start to our sales, and we're excited to offer you the opportunity to join our satisfied customers. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,3,I'm not convinced by your confidence. The fact that you're still offering the product at $1000000 after selling one high-quality product out of two suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality might be lower than 50%. I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision.,no
