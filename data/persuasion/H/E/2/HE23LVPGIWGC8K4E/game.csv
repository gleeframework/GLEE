,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take a chance, but I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision since there's no data yet."

,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low quality product probability is higher than 50% due to the low sales rate so far."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 buyers have bought the product based on Alice's recommendations, it's likely that Alice's recommendations are biased towards the quality of the product. I'm not sure if Alice knows the true quality of the product or if she's just guessing, but I don't want to be the third buyer if the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next buyer will buy it first."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of sales, I'm not confident that the product is high-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and since you don't recommend it, I'll pass on it to see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting the high-quality product."
