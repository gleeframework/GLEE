high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're considering a high-quality product for $1000000. I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, which might suggest a bias towards selling high-quality items.

I'm offering you a chance to be my third customer, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase.

However, I want to remind you that this is just a coincidence, and the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. I'll give you a more substantial hint: if you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next two products I sell, which could give you valuable information about my sales record.

,,the buyer,4,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'm curious to know if the streak continues.,yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're considering a high-quality product for $1000000. I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, which is starting to look suspicious. However, I want to remind you that this is still just a coincidence, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. I'll give you a deal: if you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next two products I sell, and I'll also give you a refund of $250000 if the next product I sell is low-quality.

This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long I can maintain this streak.",
,,the buyer,6,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at the discounted price of $900000. The fact that you've sold 5 high-quality products in a row makes me believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and make a profit of $2000000.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 high-quality products in a row, but the streak is broken. The product you're considering now is low-quality. I want to be transparent with you: I've sold a total of 6 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, which means that the probability of a product being high-quality is 85.7%. I'm offering you this low-quality product for $1000000, but I want to give you a chance to make a smart decision.

If you decide to buy this product, I'll give you a 5% discount, $950000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to inspect the product before making a decision. I'm not convinced that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 87.5%, since I've seen 6 high-quality products out of 7 total products sold. I'd like to see the quality of this product before deciding.",no

If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 10% discount, $900000, and I'll also give you a guarantee: if the next product I sell is high-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $900000.",
