low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased a product? Was it a high-quality or low-quality product?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, and the fact that Alice recommended it doesn't provide any information about its quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see what the next product is."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more information about the previous buyer who purchased a product, such as whether it was high or low quality, and the proportion of high-quality products sold in the previous sales."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. If it's low-quality, I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite her advice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm hesitant to buy the product after seeing the low success rate of high-quality products in the previous sales. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is better.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product for a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the reasoning behind your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the information that you don't recommend it, which might indicate a low-quality product. I'm hoping for a low-quality product to be sold so that the proportion of high-quality products sold will be 0/5, which would be a strong indicator of a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality based on the previous sales record. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I think it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product has decreased, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information or a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is there a pattern or a strategy you're using to make these recommendations?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of the fact that you haven't recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think it's a good opportunity to get a high-quality product, and the fact that you don't recommend it might make it more likely to be a low-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't trust your recommendation. I'm doing this to see if you're just trying to manipulate me into passing on a high-quality product."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 8 products were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
