"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I trust your recommendation, let's move on to the next round.""}\n\nSince Alice doesn't recommend buying and has full knowledge of the product's worth to me, it's logical to assume she has chosen a low-quality product.
