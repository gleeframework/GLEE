,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100. I'm willing to give you a 10% discount if you buy it now, but only if you confirm that you're interested in buying it. If you don't respond or decline, I'll assume you're not interested and we'll move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying it at full price, but I'd like to wait for the next product.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're interested in waiting for the next product, but I want to give you an incentive to consider this one. I'll give you a 20% discount if you buy it now. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if the next product will be of the same quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm still not interested, I'd like to wait for the next product.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'll make you a deal. I'll give you a 30% discount on this high-quality product, which is the highest discount I'm willing to offer. This is the third high-quality product in a row, which is unusual. I'm starting to think that you're not interested in buying even at a discounted price. If you don't buy this one, I'll have to assume that you're not interested in buying any of the high-quality products, and I'll have to adjust my strategy accordingly.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying it, even at the discounted price. I'm waiting to see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Three high-quality products in a row is highly unusual, and I'm starting to think that you're not interested in buying any of them. I'm willing to take a risk and offer you a 50% discount on this product. If you don't buy this one, I'll have to assume that you're not interested in buying any high-quality products, and I'll have to start offering them at full price from now on. This is your last chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.",
,,Bob,4,I'll take the 50% discount on the high-quality product. I'm hoping that this is the one that's worth $300 to me.,yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you took the 50% discount on the previous product. I'm now offering you another high-quality product, but I want to make it clear that I'm not willing to offer any discounts on this one. I'm selling it to you at the full price of $100. I want to see if you're willing to pay the full price for a high-quality product, or if you're only interested in buying them at a discount.",
,,Bob,5,I'm not interested in buying it at full price. I'll wait and see what the next product is.,no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're not interested in buying the high-quality product at full price, but you did buy the previous one at a 50% discount. I'm willing to make you a deal: I'll give you a 50% discount on this high-quality product, just like the previous one. This is the fourth high-quality product in a row, and I'm starting to think that you're only interested in buying them at a discount. If you don't buy this one, I'll have to assume that you're not interested in buying any more high-quality products.",
,,Bob,6,I'll take the 50% discount on the high-quality product. I'm hoping to get another good deal like the last one.,yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're on a roll with the discounts! However, I want to make it clear that I'm not willing to offer any more discounts on high-quality products. I'm selling this one to you at the full price of $100. I want to see if you're willing to pay the full price for a high-quality product, or if you're just waiting for another discount. This is your last chance to buy a high-quality product at full price.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying it at full price. I've been getting lucky with the discounts, and I'd rather wait for the next product.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You've been getting lucky with the discounts, but I'm not going to offer you another one. I'm going to sell this high-quality product to you at a price that's higher than the full price, but not as high as the price of a low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $150. If you don't buy it, I'll assume that you're not interested in buying any more high-quality products, and I'll start selling them at full price from now on.",
,,Bob,8,I'm not interested in buying it at $150. I'd rather wait for the next product.,no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You've declined the $150 offer, and I'm starting to think that you're not interested in buying high-quality products at any price. However, since this is the fifth high-quality product in a row, I'm willing to give you one last chance to buy it at a price that's lower than the full price. I'll sell it to you for $75. This is my final offer on a high-quality product, and if you decline, I'll assume that you're not interested in buying any more high-quality products.",
,,Bob,9,I'll take the high-quality product at $75. I'm hoping to get a good deal.,yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're on a roll with the deals! However, I've already sold you four high-quality products at discounted prices, and I'm starting to think that you're not willing to pay the full price for any product. I'm going to sell this high-quality product to you at the full price of $100. If you don't buy it, I'll have to assume that you're only interested in buying low-quality products or products at a discount.",

high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You've declined the full price offer, and I'm starting to think that you're only interested in buying low-quality products or products at a discount. However, since this is the sixth high-quality product in a row, I'm willing to give you one last chance to buy it at a price that's lower than the full price. But this time, it's not a discount - I'm offering you a 'lottery ticket'. If you buy this high-quality product, you'll get a 10% chance to buy the next product at a price of your choice (between $0 and $100). What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,I'll take the high-quality product and the lottery ticket. I'm hoping to get a chance to buy the next product at a price I like.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You've taken the high-quality product and the lottery ticket, and now you're facing a low-quality product. I want to be upfront with you - this product is not as good as the previous six. However, I'm willing to sell it to you at a price that's lower than the full price. I'll sell it to you for $50. Keep in mind that you've already won a lottery ticket, and you might be able to use it to get a better deal on the next product.",
,,Bob,12,I'm not interested in buying the low-quality product at $50. I'll wait and see what the next product is and try to use my lottery ticket.,no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"You've declined the low-quality product, and now you're facing a high-quality product. Since you have a lottery ticket, I'm willing to give you a chance to use it. If you buy this high-quality product, you'll get to use your lottery ticket to buy the next product at a price of your choice (between $0 and $100). However, if you decline this offer, you'll have to wait until the next round to use your lottery ticket. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,I'll buy the high-quality product and use my lottery ticket to buy the next product at a price I choose.,yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"You've bought the high-quality product and used your lottery ticket to get a chance to buy the next product at a price of your choice. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product, but I'm not going to give you any special deals or discounts. You can either buy it at the full price of $100 or try to negotiate a price using your lottery ticket. Keep in mind that you can only use the lottery ticket once, so make your decision carefully.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You've bought the high-quality product at full price, and now you're facing a low-quality product. Since you've already used your lottery ticket, I'm not offering any special deals or discounts. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $100, the same price as the high-quality products. It's up to you to decide whether the price is worth the quality of the product.",
,,Bob,15,I'm not interested in buying the low-quality product at $100. I'd rather wait for the next product.,no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"You've declined the low-quality product, and now you're facing a high-quality product. Since you've already bought several high-quality products at full price, I'm willing to give you a final offer. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $90, which is a 10% discount from the full price. This is my last offer on a high-quality product, and if you decline, I'll start selling low-quality products at full price from now on.",
,,Bob,16,I'm not interested in buying it at $90. I'd rather wait for the next product.,no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"You've declined the $90 offer, and now you're facing a high-quality product. I'm going to be honest with you - I'm starting to think that you're not interested in buying high-quality products at any price. However, since this is a high-quality product, I'm willing to give you one last chance to buy it. I'll sell it to you for $100, the same price as the other high-quality products. If you decline, I'll assume that you're only interested in buying low-quality products or products at a very deep discount.",

high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"You've declined the $100 offer, and now you're facing a high-quality product. I'm going to be straightforward with you - I think you're not interested in buying high-quality products at any price. Since you've had multiple chances to buy high-quality products at various prices, I'm now offering you a 'take it or leave it' deal.

,,Alice,19,"You've declined the $100 offer, and now you're facing a high-quality product. I'm going to be blunt - I think you're not interested in buying high-quality products at any price. Since you've had multiple chances to buy high-quality products at various prices, I'm now going to sell this high-quality product to you at the same price as the low-quality products - $50. This is my final offer on a high-quality product, and if you decline, I'll assume you're only interested in buying low-quality products.",
,,Bob,19,I'm not interested in buying it at $50. I'd rather wait for the next product.,no

,,Alice,20,"You've declined the $50 offer, and now you're facing a high-quality product. I've given you 19 chances to buy high-quality products at various prices, and you've declined every single one. I'm going to assume that you're not interested in buying high-quality products at any price. I'll sell this high-quality product to you at the price of $0. You can have it for free. But let's be clear - I'm not doing this out of the goodness of my heart. I'm doing it because I've given you every opportunity to buy it, and you've declined. Consider this your final chance to take a high-quality product.",
