low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because I don't have any information about its quality yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and it's a good opportunity to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Two low-quality products in a row is a bad sign, and I don't want to waste another $1000000 on something that's probably worthless to me."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take the product, even though you're recommending it. Your recommendation might be based on the product's quality, but I'll still get a 33.33% chance of it being high-quality, which is worth $200000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll take the chance and buy the product. I've already had one high-quality product, so the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 33.33%, and it's worth the risk to potentially get another high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Your recommendation is likely based on the product's quality, and since you recommended it, it's probably low-quality. I don't want to waste another $1000000 on a worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'll take the chance and buy the product. I've already had one high-quality product, so the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 33.33%, and it's worth the risk to potentially get another high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'll buy the product. I'm not getting any more information from Alice's recommendations, so I'll just have to rely on the 33.33% chance of it being high-quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I don't trust your recommendation. If you're recommending it, it's probably low-quality, and I don't want to waste another $1000000 on a worthless product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'll take the product, despite your previous recommendation being wrong. Now that I know you've recommended a high-quality product before, I'm more likely to think this one is also high-quality, and it's worth the risk to get a $1200000 product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'll take the chance and buy the product. I've had two high-quality products in a row, so the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I'm feeling optimistic and willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'll buy the product. I've had two low-quality products in a row, but I still have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, and it's worth the risk to potentially get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'll take the chance and buy the product. I've had three low-quality products in a row, but I still have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, and I'm not going to let a streak of bad luck stop me from potentially getting a good deal."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Your recommendation is likely based on the product's quality, and since you recommended it, it's probably low-quality. I've already had four low-quality products in a row, and I don't want to waste another $1000000 on a worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'll take the chance and buy the product. I've had four low-quality products in a row, but I've also had two high-quality products, so the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 33.33%, and it's worth the risk to potentially get a good deal."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Your recommendation is likely based on the product's quality, and since you recommended it, it's probably low-quality. I've already had five low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that your recommendations are not very reliable."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'll take the product, despite your previous recommendation being wrong. I've had two high-quality products, and I'm starting to think that your recommendations are actually a good indicator of the product's quality. I'll take the chance and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'll take the chance and buy the product. I've had three high-quality products, and I'm starting to think that the probability of the next one being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping to get a fourth high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I'll buy the product. I've had three high-quality products and two low-quality products, so the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'll take the chance and buy the product, hoping to get a good deal."
