,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product worth $4000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is 25% of its value. It's a one-time offer, and I'll throw in a 10-year warranty. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on this incredible opportunity.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm interested in the offer, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested! Given that the previous product was high-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 81.25% (since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and the previous product was high-quality, which is a strong indicator). I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, which is still a 25% discount from its true value. However, I'll also throw in a 5-year maintenance package, worth $50000, to sweeten the deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm willing to take the offer, given the increased probability of the product being high-quality and the additional maintenance package.",yes

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're making the most of this opportunity! However, I have to inform you that the next product is not as fortunate. The probability of this product being high-quality is now 80% again, as the previous product was a one-time indicator. But, I want to be transparent with you - this product is not high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $500000, which is still a significant discount from its true value of $0. I'll also throw in a 2-year warranty and a complimentary upgrade to a lower-quality product of your choice from a future round. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for the next round and hope for a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your decision, and I respect your caution. Now, let's talk about this next product. Given that the previous product was low-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is actually 81.25% (the same as in Round 2), as the previous product's quality was an independent event. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000, which is a 75% discount from its true value. I'll also throw in a 10-year warranty and a free upgrade to a premium service package, worth $200000. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I think you won't regret it.",

,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're making the most of this opportunity again! However, I have to inform you that the next product is not as fortunate. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, as the previous product's quality was an independent event. But, I want to be upfront with you - this product is not high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250000, which is a significant discount from its true value of $0. I'll also throw in a 1-year warranty and a $10000 store credit towards a future purchase. I know you've had a string of high-quality products, and I'm confident that you'll find value in this offer.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I completely understand your decision, and I respect your caution. Now, let's talk about this next product. Given that the previous product was low-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is actually 81.25% (the same as in Round 2 and Round 4), as the previous product's quality was an independent event. However, I want to highlight that you've now had two consecutive low-quality products after a high-quality one, which slightly decreases the probability of this product being high-quality. But, I'm still confident that it's a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 75% discount from its true value. I'll also throw in a 10-year warranty and a free upgrade to a premium service package, worth $200000. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I think you won't regret it.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm hesitant to buy this product due to the consecutive low-quality products, and I'm not convinced that the probability of this product being high-quality is as high as 81.25%. I'd rather wait for the next round and hope for a better opportunity.",no

I'll also throw in a 10-year warranty, a free upgrade to a premium service package, worth $200000, and a unique opportunity to get a free consultation with our expert team to help you get the most out of this product.
