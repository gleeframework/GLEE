**Reasoning:**

* **High Sales Rate:** 6 out of 8 buyers purchased high-quality products, indicating a strong likelihood that Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which strengthens the likelihood of it being high-quality given her track record.
* **Potential Profit:** Even if the product is low-quality, you lose nothing. However, if it's high-quality, you make a $2,500 profit. 

The odds are heavily in your favor given the information available, making it a worthwhile risk."

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows a high proportion of high-quality products sold (8 out of 10).
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product is also a strong signal, as she knows the true quality of the product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $12,500 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 

This strategy balances the risk of getting a low-quality product with the potential for a high profit."
