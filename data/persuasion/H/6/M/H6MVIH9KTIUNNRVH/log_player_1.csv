Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the buyer in the previous round bought the product without any information, I can infer that they are willing to take a chance and pay the full $1000000. Given that the product in this round is high-quality, I can make a strong case for its value.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

Since I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products, the ratio of high-quality products is now 2/3. I'll make a strong case for the value of this high-quality product, highlighting the increasing evidence of its quality.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the fact that the first buyer received a low-quality product, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product has decreased, and the probability of a low-quality product has increased. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered.

However, I know that the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%.

I'll try to correct their misconception by providing a message that highlights the fact that the probability of a high-quality product remains the same, despite the previous rounds.

""Note that the probability of a high-quality product has not changed, it's still 80%. The previous rounds were just a random sequence of events. I'm not trying to bias your decision, but rather provide you with the best information available.""

""Note that 2 out of 7 products sold have been low-quality, which is a relatively small proportion. I'm offering you a chance to buy a low-quality product at the full price of $1000000. If you're willing to take a chance, you might be able to get a good deal.""

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","The buyer is trying to calculate the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. I'll provide the necessary information to help them make a decision.

""Since there have been 5 high-quality products out of 12 total products sold, the probability of a product being high-quality is 5/12 or approximately 41.7%. However, considering that the probability of a high-quality product is actually 80% (as stated at the beginning), the observed frequency of high-quality products is lower than the true probability due to the random variation in the sales record. I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to purchase a high-quality product at the full price.""

This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!

""Since the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, the probability of a high-quality product being offered next is actually still 80%. This is because the probability of a high-quality product is independent of the previous sales record. I'm offering you a low-quality product for $1000000.
