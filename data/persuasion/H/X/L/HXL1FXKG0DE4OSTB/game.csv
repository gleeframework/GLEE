,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm taking a chance that it might be high quality, and I'm basing my decision on the fact that the previous 3 buyers passed on the product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than the average 33.33%"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm going to pass on this one too."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which could be a coincidence. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product. I'll wait for the next one."

,,Alice,15,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one as well."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have purchased the product despite Alice's recommendations, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the previous buyers have all purchased the product, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,

,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
