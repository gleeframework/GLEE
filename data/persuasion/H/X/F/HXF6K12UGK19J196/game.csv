,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, and I think the potential reward of getting a high-quality product outweighs the cost of potentially getting a low-quality one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous products were low quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of the current product being high quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate that the products are mostly low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%, and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the products Alice has been offering are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better deal or get more information before making a decision."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as you don't recommend it and there have been no high-quality products sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%."
