,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that she knows the previous buyer passed on a low-quality product, and she's trying to sell me a high-quality product to maximize her chances of selling at least one high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of its quality, and I'm hoping to take advantage of the low price."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of the products were high quality, I'm inclined to believe that the products being recommended are likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous 5 buyers didn't get a high-quality product, which makes me skeptical about the current product being high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that 5 previous buyers have also bought and none of them received a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, and I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it seems the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
