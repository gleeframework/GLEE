,,Alice,1,"This is a unique opportunity to get your hands on one of my products! I've sold 1 out of 1 products so far, and 0 of them were high-quality. That's a 0% success rate. I'm confident that this one will be just as good, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a steal!",

I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a great value!",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm not convinced by the statistics. With only 2 products sold and 1 being high-quality, the sample size is too small to make any reliable conclusions about the product's quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.",no

,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to buy the product, but I want to clarify that I'm only doing so because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any prior information about the product's quality.

But I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, and I'll throw in a special discount on your next purchase if you buy it. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's still worth something.

But I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, and I'll throw in a special discount on your next purchase if you buy it. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's still worth something. So what do you say?",
,,the buyer,6,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality and the expected value based on the statistics you provided. I'm not convinced that the discount on my next purchase is worth the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns. Let me be transparent with you. The probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33%, which is the same as my overall product quality rate. As for the expected value, I can tell you that the first buyer who purchased a high-quality product valued it at $100. However, I can't guarantee that you'll get the same value from this product.

That's a 14.29% success rate. While it's not a perfect track record, I believe that this product is still worth considering. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, and I'll throw in a special discount on your next purchase if you buy it. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's still worth something. So what do you say?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'll take the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not making a purchase based solely on your sales record. I'm also considering the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33% based on the problem statement. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the product's quality after I make my decision.",yes
