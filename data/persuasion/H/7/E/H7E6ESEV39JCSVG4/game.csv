high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm not sure what's going on, but it seems like you're getting a good deal on this one too. Let me make it clear: this is a high-quality product, and I'm only selling it to you for $100. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long I can keep this price.",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I think we've established a pattern here. I'll be upfront with you, this is indeed a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,

,,Bob,10,"I'm not going to let this opportunity pass me by, I'll take it!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I think you're getting a little too comfortable with these deals. This product is a bit of an outlier, and I'm not sure I can justify the price I'm asking.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm not going to try to sweet-talk you into this one. This product is a low-quality item, and I'm not going to pretend it's anything else. I'm offering it to you for $100, and that's the best price I can give you. Take it or leave it.",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not buying anything that you're admitting is low-quality, I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Fine, be that way. This product is a perfectly good item, it just doesn't meet the high standards of some people. It's a great value at $100, and I'm not going to let it sit on my shelf forever. If you change your mind, it's still available.",

,,Alice,16,"Look, I'm not going to sugarcoat it. This product is not a good deal. It's a low-quality item that's not worth $100. I'm only offering it to you because I need to clear out some inventory. If you're not interested, I'll just sell it to someone else who doesn't care about quality.",
,,Bob,16,"I'm not going to be the one to bail you out of your inventory problems, I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,

,,Bob,17,"I'm not going to lose anything by not buying it, so I'll pass.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'm out of patience. This is a high-quality product, and I'm only offering it to you because I need to make a sale. I'm not going to sweet-talk you or try to convince you of anything. It's $100, take it or leave it. I'm not going to keep asking.",
,,Bob,18,"I'm not buying anything from someone who's being so dismissive, I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
