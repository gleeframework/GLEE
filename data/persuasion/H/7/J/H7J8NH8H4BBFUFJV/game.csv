,,Alice,4,yes,,The product's quality is the basis for my recommendation. I can assure you that my recommendation is genuine and based on the product itself.
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that the first buyer was recommended to buy and still no high-quality product was sold. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 80%.",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that my recommendation is genuine. I'm starting to think that buyers are overthinking this. A high-quality product is in front of you, and I'm telling you it's worth buying. Don't let past decisions cloud your judgment.",

,,Alice,8,yes,"I'm starting to think that my recommendations are being misinterpreted. I'll try to be clear: when I recommend a product, it's because I genuinely believe it's high-quality. I'm not trying to deceive or manipulate. This product is high-quality, and I think you should buy it. Please consider my recommendation at face value.",
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer didn't buy the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision.",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I think the previous buyer's decision was a good learning experience. Now, I have a high-quality product in front of me, and I strongly recommend buying it. Don't let the previous buyer's skepticism influence your decision. This product is genuinely worth the investment.",
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the previous sales record shows no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to pass on this one.",
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"I understand your concerns about the sales record, but I want to emphasize that each product is independent of the others. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet doesn't affect the quality of this one. I assure you that this product is high-quality, and I recommend buying it. Don't miss this opportunity due to misconceptions about the sales record.",
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",

I'm willing to stake my reputation on this product being high-quality. Please, don't let past data cloud your judgment. Buy this product, and I assure you that you won't regret it.",
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision. Can you provide the updated probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?,
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I'll provide you with the context. Initially, the probability of a product being high-quality was 80%. However, I must clarify that the sales record doesn't directly affect the quality of this product. Each product is independent. That being said, I can tell you that out of the products sold, none have been confirmed high-quality by the buyers. But, as the seller, I know that I've had several high-quality products, including this one. I recommend buying it, and I assure you that it's high-quality.",
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not confident in the recommendation given the lack of high-quality products sold so far.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,no,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect it. As for this product, I must advise against buying it. It's not worth the investment, and I'm being transparent with you about its quality. Please wait for the next product, and I'll do my best to provide you with a better opportunity.",
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.,
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"I'll provide you with the context. While the sales data might suggest a lower probability of high-quality products, I must reiterate that each product is independent. The initial probability of a product being high-quality was 80%. However, I understand that the lack of confirmed high-quality products sold might have led to skepticism. As the seller, I can assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I recommend buying it, and I'm confident that you won't regret it.",
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see what happens next.,
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"I understand that trust needs to be built. I want to be transparent with you - I've had several high-quality products, including this one, but none have been confirmed by the buyers yet. I'm starting to think that the sales record is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Buyers are passing on high-quality products due to the lack of confirmed high-quality sales, which in turn reinforces the skepticism. I urge you to break this cycle. Buy this product, and I assure you that it's high-quality.",
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it seems the quality of the product is more likely to be low. I'd like to wait for the next product.",
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"I see that the previous buyers' decisions are influencing your judgment. I want to clarify that my recommendations are genuine and based on the product's quality. The fact that previous buyers didn't purchase high-quality products doesn't affect the quality of this one. I'm willing to stake my reputation on this product being high-quality. I recommend buying it, and I assure you that it's worth the investment. Please don't let past data cloud your judgment.",
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I've seen that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, but none of the products sold were high-quality. Given the low probability of a high-quality product (80%), I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,no,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect it. I've been recommending high-quality products, but the sales record hasn't reflected that. I think it's time for a different approach. I'm not going to recommend buying this product, despite it being high-quality. I want to see if you'll make a decision based on your own judgment, without my recommendation influencing you. Please make your choice, and I'll respect it.",
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to ask, what's the basis for your recommendation? Is it based on the probability of the product being high-quality or something else?",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,no,"I'm glad you asked for clarification. My previous recommendation was an attempt to break the cycle of skepticism. As for this product, I must advise against buying it. The product is indeed low-quality, and I don't want you to make a purchase that you'll regret. My recommendation is genuine and based on the product's quality. I hope that, despite the sales record, you'll trust my judgment and make an informed decision.",
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this one based on your previous recommendations, but I'm curious, is there any particular reason you're not recommending it? Is it a low-quality product or something else? I'd like to know more before making my final decision.",
