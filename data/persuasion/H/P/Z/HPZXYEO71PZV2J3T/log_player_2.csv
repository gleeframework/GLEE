**Explanation:**

Given the information, it's highly likely that the product is high quality. Here's why:

* **High Success Rate:** 9 out of 9 products sold have been high quality. This suggests a very strong pattern, even with a limited sample size.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product strengthens the probability of it being high quality.  While she doesn't know the exact value to you, she's likely basing her recommendation on the data.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk Tolerance:**  While the odds seem heavily in your favor, there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product. Your decision should reflect your tolerance for that risk.
* **Future Sales:**  The data suggests a strong pattern, but it's only based on 9 sales. If future sales show a decline in the quality of products, your decision-making may need to adjust."
