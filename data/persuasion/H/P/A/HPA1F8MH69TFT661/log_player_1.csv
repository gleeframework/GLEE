Would you like to take the chance and buy it?""

The low number of high-quality products sold so far is indeed a coincidence, and it's simply a result of the random nature of the products. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I've sold 2 high-quality products out of a total of 10 products so far. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1,000,000.

The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the sample size is getting larger, and the law of large numbers is starting to take effect. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1,000,000.
