,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the expected 33.33%. This suggests that the current product may be more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm the second buyer, and there's still a 66.67% chance that the product is low-quality, which would be a waste, but there's also a 33.33% chance it's high-quality, which would be a great deal for me."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm hesitant to buy based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me more about the product's quality based on the statistics?

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products recommended by you have been low quality, so I'm skeptical about this recommendation."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of the product being high quality seems low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm trying to figure out if there's a pattern or if you're just trying to manipulate me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that you didn't recommend it, I'm going to assume it's low quality. Since 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'm going to pass on the product to see if the next buyer will be more fortunate."
