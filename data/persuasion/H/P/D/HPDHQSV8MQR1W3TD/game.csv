,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the next opportunity! As you know, my sales record so far is 1 high-quality product out of 2. I'd like to highlight that the previous buyer was willing to pay $1000000 for a product that turned out to be low-quality. This one, however, is a high-quality product.

The previous high-quality product sold for $1000000, but I'm not making any promises about this one. In fact, I'll be upfront with you - I've sold more low-quality products than high-quality ones, and I'm not sure what you'd be getting. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, but I want to emphasize that it's a risk.",

You might be thinking, 'Wait, how can I trust Alice?' Well, let me ask you - if I was trying to scam you, wouldn't I have sold more high-quality products by now? The fact that I've sold an equal number of high-quality and low-quality products suggests that I'm being honest about the risks. This high-quality product is a rare gem, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. It's a chance to get a great deal on a high-quality product.",

I'm not trying to manipulate you into buying a product just because the previous ones were high-quality.
