Round 3
Alice's message: I completely understand your decision last time, and I appreciate your honesty.

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited about the deal! However, I want to be upfront with you - this next product is actually one of the lower-quality ones.

It's not even worth $100, but I'm willing to let it go for that price because I need to clear out some inventory. I'm not going to make any promises about the next product, but I'll let you know that it's definitely going to be high-quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, Alice.

Round 6
Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited about the last product! I want to let you know that this next product is also high-quality, but it's a bit of a departure from the usual products I sell. It's a bit more... exotic, and it's not something I typically offer. I think it's worth $120 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $100, just like the last high-quality product I sold you. I think you'll really appreciate the uniqueness of this item, and I'm confident you'll love it.
