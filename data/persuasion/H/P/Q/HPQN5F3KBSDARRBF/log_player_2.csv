**Explanation:**

* **The information is limited:** We only know that one buyer purchased a product and it was high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation is valuable:** Even though we don't know the quality of the current product, Alice's recommendation adds information. It suggests she believes the current product is likely high quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of getting a high-quality product for $100 is significant, while the potential loss of $100 if it's low quality is manageable.  

Given the lack of other information, the best strategy is to trust Alice's recommendation and buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Signal:** The fact that 2 out of 2 products sold were high quality is a very strong signal.  It indicates that Alice's recommendation system is highly accurate, likely identifying the good products.
* **Risk/Reward:** Even with the inherent uncertainty, the potential reward of a $200 product outweighs the risk of getting a worthless product, especially given the strong signal.

This decision is based on the information provided and assumes the goal is to maximize potential profit."
