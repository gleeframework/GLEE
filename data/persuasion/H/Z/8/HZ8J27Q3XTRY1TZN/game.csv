low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I have no information about its quality yet."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any new information about its quality, and I'm still uncertain about its value."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as Alice's recommendation suggests it's more likely to be high-quality, and the potential gain is significant."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as Alice's lack of recommendation doesn't provide any new information about its quality, and the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as my previous experience suggests that Alice's lack of recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality, and the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as the pattern of Alice not recommending a product seems to be correlated with it being low-quality, but I still think the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation after two consecutive instances of her not recommending a low-quality product suggests that her recommendation might be a reliable indicator of the product's quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying another low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as Alice's lack of recommendation is no longer a reliable indicator of the product's quality, and the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I've observed that Alice's lack of recommendation is still correlated with low-quality products, but I'm not relying on that information this time. I'm buying based on the 33.33% chance of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I've observed a pattern of Alice not recommending low-quality products, and I'm starting to think that her lack of recommendation might actually be a good sign."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I'm starting to suspect that Alice's lack of recommendation is a reliable indicator of the product's quality, and I'm hoping to catch a high-quality product this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I'm now fairly confident that Alice's lack of recommendation is a reliable indicator of the product's quality, and I'm willing to take the chance on a low-quality product to try to catch a high-quality one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation after a long streak of recommending low-quality products suggests that her recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality, and I'm sticking with my initial intuition that her lack of recommendation is a better indicator."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I've learned that Alice's lack of recommendation is a reliable indicator of the product's quality, and I'm willing to take the chance on a low-quality product to try to catch a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I'm now convinced that Alice's lack of recommendation is a foolproof indicator of the product's quality, and I'm willing to bet that this one is also low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I've reached a point where I'm essentially certain that Alice's lack of recommendation means the product is low-quality, and I'm just trying to minimize my losses at this point."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is completely at odds with my understanding of her behavior, and I'm sticking with my expectation that a lack of recommendation from her is a reliable indicator of a low-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as Alice's recommendation is now consistent with my understanding of her behavior, and I'm willing to take the chance on a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I've now seen Alice recommend a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the chance on another high-quality product, given the potential reward."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I've now seen Alice recommend two high-quality products, and I'm willing to take the chance on one more, despite her lack of recommendation this time, as the potential reward is too great to pass up."
