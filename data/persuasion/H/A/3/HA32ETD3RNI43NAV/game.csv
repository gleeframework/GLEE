low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, I'd expect the probability of the current product being high-quality to be around 33.33%, which is the same as the prior probability. However, since you've recommended against buying the product, I'm concerned that you might be using some information that I don't have. Could you please share your reasoning or any additional information that led you to this decision?"
