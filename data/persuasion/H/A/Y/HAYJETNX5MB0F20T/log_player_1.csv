Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

**Explanation:**

The buyer now knows your selling record is 10 high-quality and 6 low-quality products. This means they will rationally assume there's a 62.5% chance this product is high-quality. However, even though the odds are in your favor, it's still not worth recommending a purchase. 

Here's why:

* **The risk is high:** The buyer knows that there's a significant chance (37.5%) that the product is low-quality. This risk is too high for most buyers, especially considering the high price.
* **No additional information:** You have no way of proving this product is high-quality. The buyer only has the statistics of your past sales, and there's no reason to believe this product is any different from the average.

While the buyer might be tempted by your impressive track record, it's important to act in their best interest by not recommending a purchase when the risk is substantial."
