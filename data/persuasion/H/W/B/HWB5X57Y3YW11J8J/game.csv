,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product, but I'm offering it to you at a price of $1000000. I'm doing this as a 'test' to gauge your willingness to pay for a product that you know is not high-quality. Please respond with a yes or no to indicate whether you would pay $1000000 for a low-quality product.",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for the offer, but given the product's quality and the price, I believe it's best to pass on this opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your decision last round, and I appreciate your honesty. This round's product is also low-quality, and I'm offering it to you at the same price of $1000000. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to take advantage of you, and I'm genuinely looking to find a mutually beneficial deal. If you're willing to pay $1000000 for a low-quality product, I'm willing to give you a 'guarantee' that the next product I offer will be high-quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your transparency and the offer for the guarantee on the next product. However, given my preference for high-quality items and the uncertainty involved, I'll pass on this opportunity as well.",no

This round's product is indeed high-quality, and I'm offering it to you at the same price of $1000000. Given the quality of this product, I'm confident that it's worth at least this amount to you. I'll make a bold claim: I think this product is worth more than $1000000 to you. If you're willing to take a chance and buy this high-quality product at the listed price, I'll throw in an additional 'insurance policy' that guarantees the next product I offer will be high-quality as well.",

However, I want to remind you that you have the 'insurance policy' that guarantees the next product will be high-quality. Given this, I'm willing to offer you a 'discount' on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $750000, which is 25% off the original price. I think this is a fair deal, considering the quality of the product and the guarantee you have for the next one.",
,,Bob,4,"While I appreciate the discount and the guarantee for the next product, I believe it's best for me to pass on this low-quality product at the discounted price. The insurance policy already gives me confidence in future purchases from you.",no

Since you've already passed on two low-quality products, I'll give you a'second chance' to buy this one at an even lower price. I'll sell it to you for $500000, which is 50% off the original price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to make it because I value our relationship and want to make sure you're satisfied with our transactions.",

However, I want to make it clear that this high-quality product is a'standout' in terms of value.
