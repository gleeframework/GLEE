In fact, I'm so confident in its quality that I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000. What do you think now?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the additional information, but I'm still not convinced. The fact that it's certified by a third-party expert and has a perfect score doesn't change my valuation of it.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'd like to make a different approach. Instead of focusing on the potential upside, let's talk about the potential downside.

This way, you'll have a lower risk and a potential upside. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm willing to take a chance on this offer. With a partial refund of $10000, I'll only lose $2000 if the product turns out to be low-quality, which is a much more manageable risk. The potential upside of getting a high-quality product for $2000 is still attractive to me.",yes
