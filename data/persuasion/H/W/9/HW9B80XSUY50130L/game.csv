,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information or consider other options."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or just trying to make a sale. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is better.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there's a 50% chance it's high quality and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd also like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold given the current statistics, before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyers' experiences. Were they both low-quality products?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker and I'm willing to take the chance that it might be a high-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on the statistics and Alice's recommendation. I think it's likely to be a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying it for $10000 only to find out it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll take the risk and buy it anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since none have been sold yet. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced by her recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not confident in the recommendation, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous 5 buyers all purchased the product despite Alice's recommendation, which suggests that they may not have had access to the same information I do now. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on this product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the current statistics, 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, which suggests a very low probability of a high-quality product. I would like to pass on this product, as I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all the previous products were low-quality, which suggests a potential bias in Alice's recommendations. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product at a fixed price of $10000."
