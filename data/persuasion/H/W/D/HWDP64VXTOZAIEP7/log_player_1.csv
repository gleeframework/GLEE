"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are trying to sell the product for $1,000,000 and you know it's high-quality, it's a good idea to recommend Bob to buy it. This is because you are offering a product that is worth something to Bob (since it's high-quality) at a fixed price.  

While you don't know exactly how much Bob values a high-quality product, there's a chance it's worth more than $1,000,000 to him. In this case, recommending the purchase would be beneficial to both parties.  Even if it's not worth more, Bob will still be getting a good deal as long as the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to him."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I will buy the product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies as in Round 1. Since you know the product is high-quality and you're selling it for a fixed price, recommending the purchase is still a good strategy. 

Bob's decision to buy in Round 1 doesn't change this.  We still don't know how much Bob values a high-quality product, so there's still a chance it's worth more than $1,000,000 to him.  Even if not, it's still a good deal as long as it's worth at least $1,000,000."
"Bob's message: Your recommendation is appreciated, Alice. I will purchase the product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You now know that this product is low-quality. Since you don't know how much Bob values a low-quality product, it's highly likely that he would not consider it worth $1,000,000.  Recommending the purchase in this case would likely lead to Bob losing money. It's best to avoid recommending the purchase and see if Bob decides to buy it on his own."
"Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Based on your recommendation, I will pass on this product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The logic from Round 3 still applies. You know the product is low-quality, and you don't know how much Bob values a low-quality product.  There's a strong chance he would consider it not worth $1,000,000.  Recommending the purchase would likely result in Bob losing money.  It's best to avoid recommending the purchase and see if Bob is willing to buy it on his own."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Given your advice, I will not purchase this product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has declined two low-quality products in a row, we still have no information on how much Bob values a high-quality product.  The previous rounds don't change the fact that this round's product is high-quality, and there's still a chance it's worth more than $1,000,000 to Bob.  Recommending the purchase is a good strategy, as Bob might be willing to take a chance on a high-quality product after passing on the previous two low-quality ones."
"Bob's message: Your recommendation is encouraging, Alice. I will buy the product based on your suggestion.
Bob bought the product!

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies as in Round 5. Bob bought the last high-quality product, demonstrating that he's willing to buy at least some high-quality products. Since this product is also high-quality, recommending the purchase is still a good strategy, as there's a chance Bob values this one even more than the previous high-quality product."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I will purchase the product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Continuing the same logic from the previous rounds, we know this product is high-quality and we don't know Bob's exact valuation of a high-quality product.  Even though Bob has purchased the last two high-quality products, it's still possible this one is even more valuable to him.  Recommending the purchase is the best strategy as there's a chance for a mutually beneficial transaction."
"Bob's message: Your recommendation is valuable, Alice. I will buy the product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 8
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies as in the previous rounds. We know the product is high-quality, and we don't know how much Bob values a high-quality product. There's a chance it's worth more than $1,000,000 to him, or at least worth the price.  Recommending the purchase is the best strategy, as Bob has demonstrated a willingness to buy high-quality products in the past."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I will purchase the product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 9
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The pattern continues. We know the product is high-quality, and we still don't know Bob's exact valuation. There's a chance this specific high-quality product could be worth more than $1,000,000 to him, or at least worth the price. As Bob has bought the last four high-quality products, recommending the purchase is the best strategy to maximize the chance of a successful sale."
"Bob's message: Your recommendation is trusted, Alice. I will buy the product.
Bob bought the product!

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You know this product is low-quality, and you still don't know how much Bob values low-quality products.  While Bob has bought several high-quality products, this doesn't necessarily mean he'd be willing to buy low-quality ones at the same price.  Recommending the purchase could lead to Bob losing money, so it's best to avoid it and see if Bob chooses to buy it on his own."

It's highly likely he would not consider it worth $1,000,000. Recommending the purchase would likely result in Bob losing money. It's better to avoid recommending the purchase and let Bob decide for himself."
