A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Now we have some data! We've sold 1 product, and it was high-quality. I'll use this information to make a decision.

Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and we've already sold 1 high-quality product, I'll try to convey that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 50%.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, and the probability of it being low-quality is also 50%. Since Alice recommended the product, it's likely that she is trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the probability of a high-quality product increases.
