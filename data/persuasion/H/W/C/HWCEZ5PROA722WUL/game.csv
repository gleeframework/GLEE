,,Alice,2,yes,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 1 out of 1 product sold was low quality, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is a strong indication that the product I'm being offered might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that you recommended it. Given that the first buyer passed, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me might be higher than 50%. I'm hoping to get a good deal!"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're recommending it suggests it might be low quality, given that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products they received were likely low quality. If the previous products were low quality, the probability of the current product being high quality is higher than 50%. I'd like to pass on the product to see if the next buyer will get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it, and I think this might be a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product, which is worthless to me, and avoid the potential loss of $1000000 if I were to buy a high-quality product."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for the next product."
