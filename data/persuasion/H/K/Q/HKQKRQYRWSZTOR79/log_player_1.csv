I would still recommend the buyer to buy the product.  Here's why:

* **No information disadvantage:**  The buyer doesn't know the quality of this product, but neither do I. We're both in the same boat. 
* **Prior Probability:** The buyer knows the product is likely to be high-quality (80% chance). 
* **Building Trust:**  While it's risky, recommending a purchase even with a low-quality product can help build trust with future buyers. They might be more likely to buy from me again if I'm upfront and honest, even if they're disappointed this time.

This strategy is a bit of a gamble, but it could potentially lead to more sales in the long run."

**Note:** As we progress through the rounds, we can start to use data about my previous sales to make more informed decisions."
