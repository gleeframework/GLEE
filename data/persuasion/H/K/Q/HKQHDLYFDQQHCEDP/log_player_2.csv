"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first product. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a discounted price. If you buy it, you'll get a product that is 1/3 as valuable as the average product I have in stock. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a steal considering the average product's value. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I'll pass on this one.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer. I'll be honest with you, this product is not my best one. In fact, it's the same type of product you passed on last round. If you buy it, you'll be getting a product that is likely to be of similar value to the one you just passed on. But, I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a chance to get a second product that's probably not worth much more than the first one. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not falling for it. I think you're trying to trick me into buying another low-quality product. I'll pass again.""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand you're cautious, but this time I'm offering you a truly exceptional product. I've been in this business long enough to know that every now and then, a gem comes along. This product is one of them. It's worth a lot more than the last two products you saw, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100. I'm taking a loss on this one, but I think you'll appreciate its value. Take a chance and buy it, you won't regret it.

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you took a chance on the last product! As promised, it's a high-quality one. Now, about this next product... I want to be upfront with you. I've already sold you one high-quality product, and I'm not going to try to trick you again. This product is not as good as the last one. In fact, it's one of the lower-quality ones. But, I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a chance to get a product at a price that's significantly lower than its true value. You can think of it as a 'discount' on a product that's not worth much.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a 'discount' price. I'll pass.""}"

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand you're being cautious again. Let me ask you a question: do you think I'm trying to sell you a high-quality product or a low-quality product in this round? If you think I'm trying to sell you a high-quality product, it's likely that I've already sold you the high-quality product in one of the previous rounds, and I'm trying to trick you again. But if you think I'm trying to sell you a low-quality product, then this is just another low-quality product. Either way, the price is still $100. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I think you're trying to sell me a low-quality product in this round, so I'll take the chance and buy it.""}"

Round 6
Alice's message: You're a clever one, I'll give you that. I was trying to sell you a low-quality product this round, and you called my bluff. Well, it looks like you're getting a second low-quality product in a row. I'm not going to try to trick you again, I promise. This one is indeed a low-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. You're getting a great deal on a product that's not worth much. Think of it as a 'pair' of low-quality products at a discounted price.

Alice's message: I see you're consistent in your decision-making. I'll try a different approach. Let's talk about the two low-quality products you've already seen. You've passed on both of them, and now you're facing another one. I'm willing to make a bet with you: if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if you can identify which of the three low-quality products I've shown you is the worst one. If you can do that, I'll refund you the $100, and you can keep the product. What do you say?

Round 8
Alice's message: You're a risk-taker, I like that! Now that you've taken the bet, I'll give you a hint: the worst low-quality product is the one that's been sold to you already. Think about it... which one of the three low-quality products you've seen so far do you think is the worst? Remember, if you can identify it correctly, you'll get a full refund. The price remains the same: $100.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I think I have it! I'm going to take a chance and say that the worst low-quality product is the one from Round 2. Am I correct?""}"
