,,Alice,1,"I'm offering a premium product that has been thoroughly inspected and certified to be of the highest quality. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a top-of-the-line item. The price is $1000000, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Would you like to purchase it?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, but I'll only do so if it's high-quality. If it's low-quality, I'll be very disappointed.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in purchasing a high-quality product! I've sold one high-quality item already, which is a good indicator of the overall quality of my offerings.

,,the buyer,2,"I appreciate your confidence in the product's quality, but I'd like to take a chance and see if I can get a high-quality product at a better price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold two high-quality products so far, which is a great sign of the overall quality of my offerings. However, every product is unique, and I want to be transparent with you. I've also sold one low-quality product, which is a reminder that even with the best intentions, sometimes things don't meet expectations. I'm offering this product to you at the standard price of $1000000. Would you like to take a chance and purchase it?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take a chance and purchase the product. Given the statistics, I'm hoping the third product is high-quality as well.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold three products now, and it's clear that the quality can vary. I want to be upfront with you: two of the three products sold so far have been high-quality, but one was not. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this product is low-quality. However, I'm still willing to sell it to you for the standard price of $1000000. Keep in mind that the next product I have available is likely to be high-quality, given the statistics.",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. I'm willing to take a chance on the low-quality product, but I'm hoping that the next one will be high-quality. I'll take the risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold four products now, and it's clear that the quality is not consistent. Two high-quality products and two low-quality products. I want to be transparent with you - the next product I have available is also low-quality. I'm offering it to you for the standard price of $1000000. Keep in mind that the odds are against the next product being high-quality, given the pattern we've seen so far.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm not convinced by your transparency, Alice. I'd like to see a different approach from you. I'm willing to take a risk, but I need a better chance of getting a high-quality product. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold four low-quality products in a row, which is unusual. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this is a concerning trend. However, I want to assure you that I have a high-quality product available now. I'm willing to offer it to you at the standard price of $1000000, but I want to make it clear that this is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product after a streak of low-quality ones. Would you like to take advantage of this chance?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take the chance. I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, and I'm willing to take the risk given the unusual streak of low-quality products. I'll take the product.",yes

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold six low-quality products in a row, followed by a high-quality one. I want to acknowledge that the streak of low-quality products is unusual, but it's also a reminder that every product is unique. I'm offering this high-quality product to you now, and I'm confident that it will meet your expectations. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to make up for the previous low-quality products with this one.

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold two high-quality products out of the last two products, which is a great sign. However, I want to remind you that the overall ratio of high-quality to low-quality products is still 2:6, which is not as favorable as I would like. I'm offering this high-quality product to you now, and I'm willing to sell it to you at the standard price of $1000000. I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to mislead you with the recent streak of high-quality products - every product is still a 50% chance of being high-quality.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold three high-quality products in a row, but it's clear that the previous streak was an anomaly. The overall ratio of high-quality to low-quality products is still 5:8, which is not in my favor. I'm offering this low-quality product to you now, and I want to be upfront with you - it's not worth the standard price of $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for a discounted price of $500000, but I want to make it clear that it's not a good value. Would you like to take the risk and buy it?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm not convinced by your reasoning. With 5 high-quality products out of 13, the ratio is actually 5:8 in your favor. I'm not sure why you're trying to downplay the streak. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for the next product.",no
