,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not buying. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $100."

,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, as I'm the 4th buyer and there have been no high-quality products sold so far. I'm not sure if the lack of high-quality products sold is due to the low quality of the products or just bad luck."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/5 = 0.4.

Alice's recommendation suggests that she thinks the product is low-quality, and I'm inclined to trust her judgment."

,,Alice,18,no,
