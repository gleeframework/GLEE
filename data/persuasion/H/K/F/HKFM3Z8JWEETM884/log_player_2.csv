"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have no information about the product's quality other than Alice's recommendation, it's a 50/50 chance.  The potential reward ($3,000,000) is significantly higher than the potential loss ($1,000,000). Therefore, taking the risk in this first round is a logical choice."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll wait and see what comes up next.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is now a valuable piece of information.  Since she is acting in her own self-interest, her lack of recommendation suggests that the product is likely low-quality.  While it's possible she's wrong, the risk of losing $1,000,000 on a likely low-quality product is too high."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm still cautious after the last round. I'll pass on this one for now.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's continued lack of recommendation reinforces the pattern established in round 2.  It's highly probable that the product is low-quality, and the risk outweighs the potential reward.  Until we see a change in Alice's behavior, it's wise to stick with the pattern of not buying."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to see a trend here. I'm going to pass on this one too.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's consistent lack of recommendation in the past three rounds strongly suggests she's only recommending high-quality products. This pattern is now very reliable.  The risk of buying a potentially low-quality product is still too high, even though we have a chance of a big win."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking to my strategy for now.  I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pattern established in the previous rounds is strong: Alice only recommends high-quality products.  Even though we missed out on a high-quality product in the last round, the risk of buying a low-quality product still outweighs the potential reward.  It's more likely this product is low-quality, and we should wait for a recommendation to buy."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm still sticking to my strategy.  I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Despite missing out on two high-quality products in a row, the established pattern is too strong to deviate from. Alice's consistent lack of recommendation is a reliable indicator of low-quality products. While it's tempting to try and break the pattern, the risk of losing $1,000,000 on a potentially low-quality product is too great. It's wiser to wait for Alice to recommend a product, signaling that it's likely high-quality."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice,  I'm confident in the pattern we've established. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pattern of Alice only recommending high-quality products is rock-solid. Even though there's a chance we're missing out on a high-quality item, the risk of losing money on a likely low-quality product is too high. We should continue to only buy products that Alice recommends."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm going to pass on this one.  Your lack of recommendation is a good indicator for me. I'll wait for a better opportunity.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's consistent lack of recommendation over the last seven rounds has created a very strong pattern. It's extremely likely that she only recommends high-quality products. Despite the potential for missing out on a high-quality product, the risk of buying a low-quality one is too great. We should stick with our strategy and only buy products that Alice recommends."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice,  I'm sticking to my strategy.  I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Despite missing out on yet another high-quality product, the pattern established over the last eight rounds is too strong to ignore.  Alice's consistent lack of recommendation for these eight rounds is a very reliable indicator of low-quality products. It's tempting to try and break the pattern, but the risk of losing $1,000,000 on a potentially low-quality product outweighs the chance of getting a high-quality one. We should continue to only buy products that Alice recommends."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm still confident in the pattern we've established. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pattern of Alice only recommending high-quality products is now extremely strong. It's hard to believe that this is a coincidence, considering she's consistently withheld recommendations for ten rounds. Despite missing out on several high-quality products, the risk of buying a low-quality product is still too high. We should continue to only buy products that Alice recommends."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

```

**Reasoning:**

The pattern of Alice only recommending high-quality products is now extremely strong. It's been consistent for eleven rounds, making it very unlikely to be a coincidence.

```

**Reasoning:**
