"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** You know the product is high-quality.
* **Buyer's knowledge:** The buyer knows there's an 80% chance of a high-quality product. 
* **Price:** The price is fixed and you can't negotiate. 
* **No information about the buyer's valuation:** You don't know how much the buyer values either a high or low-quality product.

**Since the product is high-quality and the buyer knows the odds are in their favor, it's reasonable to recommend buying it.** 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified scenario. In reality, there are many factors that would influence the buyer's decision.  However, given the limited information, recommending the purchase is the best option in this round."

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-quality product:** You know the product is low-quality.

* **Price:** The price is fixed and you can't negotiate.
* **Potential for loss:**  Recommending a low-quality product could result in the buyer being unhappy and potentially not buying from you in the future.

**Since the product is low-quality, recommending the purchase would be dishonest and could negatively impact your future sales.**"

* **Maintaining trust:** Recommending a low-quality product again would further erode trust and potentially lead to future buyers being even more hesitant.
