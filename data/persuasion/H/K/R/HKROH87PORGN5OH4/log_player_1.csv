With that in mind, I'll offer you another high-quality product for $1,000,000. But I'll also throw in a condition: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 'free' option to buy the next product at a lower price, if it's a low-quality one. What do you think?""

However, I'll also give you a hint about the next product: I've received a new shipment, and I'm not entirely confident about the quality of the next product. It's a 50-50 chance.

Each of the four high-quality products you've bought is actually worth $1,500,000 to you. This means you've essentially overpaid by $500,000 for each of those products.
