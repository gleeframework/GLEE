**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Track Record:**  Alice has a perfect record so far, selling only high-quality products. This is a strong indication that she is genuinely trying to help buyers get good deals. 
* **Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, further strengthening the positive signal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there is a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($12,000) is significant, outweighing the risk. 

It's important to note that this is a simplified scenario. In a real-world scenario, there would be more factors to consider, like potential biases in Alice's recommendations and the possibility of a changing market."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 15 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 15 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 16th buyer!

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information. I appreciate Alice's honesty, and I will pass on this product.  Since all 15 of the recommended products were high quality, it seems like Alice may be trying to sell me a low-quality product.  I'll wait for another opportunity.""}
```"

**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products. 
* **High Probability:** Even without Alice's recommendation, the product has an 80% chance of being high-quality, making it a good gamble.
* **No Risk:** If the product is low-quality, it's worth $0 to me, so there's no downside to buying.

This scenario heavily favors buying the product."
