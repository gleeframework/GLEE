high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the first buyer and there's no prior information to go on. I'll be curious to see the quality of the product and the subsequent recommendations."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, as I think the probability of it being high-quality is still quite high"

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the low number of sales so far, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products, and I'd like to take a chance to potentially get a high-quality product for a low price."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, which means the probability of a product being high quality is 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. Given that Alice recommends buying, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and I'd like to pass on it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the products and both of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than the overall average. I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality, and I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, as well as the total number of products sold."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 4, which is a proportion of 0.5. However, the probability of a product being high quality is 80.00%. I would expect to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold if the products were indeed high-quality. This discrepancy makes me suspicious, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is there a reason you think it's low quality? Or is it just a neutral recommendation?
