"The buyer's message: I'd like to take the chance, but I'm going to have to think carefully about this. Given the low-quality products you've sold recently, I'm worried that this might be another low-quality product. However, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I stand to gain $20000 if I'm right.

}"
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take a chance, but I'd like to clarify that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33% based on the overall odds, and the recent streak of sales doesn't necessarily change that.

However, I want to be transparent with you: I've been selling products for 12 rounds, and I've only been able to sell 8 high-quality products. This means that 4 out of the 12 products I've sold were low-quality. I'm offering it to you for $10000. Given the recent history, do you think this product is more likely to be low-quality?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product. Given the recent history of two low-quality products, I'm a bit skeptical, but I'm willing to take the chance.
