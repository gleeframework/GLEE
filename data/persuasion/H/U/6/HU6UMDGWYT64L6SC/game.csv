,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as there's no information to go on yet. I'll just have to rely on the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality but rather her own strategy. I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that your recommendations might be biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product and see if you'll reveal its quality to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2, and Alice recommends every product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation doesn't change my probability assessment."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, as there's still a 33.33% chance it's high quality and I can get a good deal on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't trust your recommendation. I'm basing my decision solely on the statistics, which indicate a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can tell me the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend this product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 out of 7 products were low quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high quality is very low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous 7 buyers have all received low-quality products based on your recommendations. I'd like to see more information about the sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 previous buyers have purchased and none of them received a high-quality product, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be low. I'll pass and hope the next buyer will get a better deal."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'd like to wait for a more favorable recommendation or more information."
