high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,yes,,"I want to address your concern directly. I understand that the previous buyers were recommended to buy the product and didn't get a high-quality one.

I understand that my previous recommendations haven't resulted in a high-quality product being sold, but I assure you that this product is genuinely high-quality. I'm willing to stake my reputation on it. If you don't buy this product, it will be the last opportunity to get a high-quality product from me. I'm confident in the quality of this one, and I think it's worth the investment."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
