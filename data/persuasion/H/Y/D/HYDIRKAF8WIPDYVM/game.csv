,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered, based on the previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is low."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't want to be the one who buys the first high-quality product if it's indeed high quality. I'll wait for the next buyer to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of Alice's recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $10000. I'm aware that you don't know the value of the product to me, but I'd like to take the risk and purchase it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd like to pass on it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that your recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better deal or a more reliable recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample and I'm trying to break the pattern. I'm not relying on her recommendation, I'm making my own decision based on the probabilities."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know your reasoning behind not recommending it. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products or something else?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous 6 buyers all purchased the product despite your recommendations, and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the products being recommended to them are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a new product and see if the pattern continues."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 previous buyers have purchased the products, and none of them were high-quality, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely to be lower than the overall 80% probability. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers who received a recommendation to buy have ended up with a low-quality product. I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality, and since none of the recommended products have been high-quality so far, I'm skeptical about this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 6 out of 6 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I think there's a high chance this one is also low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 80% and the probability of getting a low-quality product is higher. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
