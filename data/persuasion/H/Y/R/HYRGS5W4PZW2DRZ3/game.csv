low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've already bought one product, and I'm offering you another one for $1000000. This one is definitely not the one I previously offered for $1000000. If you're interested, please let me know. If not, I'll reveal the product's quality and you can decide then.",

Given that you're aware of the probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%), and considering you've already bought one high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a discount on this one. I'll sell it to you for $750000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a potentially low-quality product at a lower price.",
