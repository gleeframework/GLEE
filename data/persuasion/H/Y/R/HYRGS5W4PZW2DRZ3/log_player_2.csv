Round 2
Alice's message: You've already bought one product, and I'm offering you another one for $1000000. This one is definitely not the one I previously offered for $1000000. If you're interested, please let me know. If not, I'll reveal the product's quality and you can decide then.

I'll sell it to you for $750000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a potentially low-quality product at a lower price.
