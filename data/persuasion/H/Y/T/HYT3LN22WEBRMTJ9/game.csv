,,the buyer,1,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you provide the actual statistics on the quality of the products you've sold so far? How many high-quality products have you sold out of the total number of products sold?",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to provide you with the actual statistics. Out of the 1 product I've sold so far, 1 of them have been high-quality. That's a success rate of 100%! I'm proud to say that my products have a high chance of being top-notch. With this new product, I'm confident that the odds are in your favor. Would you like to take a chance on this exceptional opportunity?",
,,the buyer,2,"I appreciate your confidence, but with only one product sold and it being high-quality, I'm not convinced that the sample size is representative of the overall quality of your products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",no

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your curiosity! Given the data, it's true that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were high-quality. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is not 100%. In fact, the probability is 80%, which is the inherent quality of my products. The fact that both products sold so far happened to be high-quality is just a coincidence. I'm confident that this new product is also high-quality, but I understand if you'd like to wait for more data. Would you like to take a chance on this exceptional opportunity?",
,,the buyer,5,I'd like to wait for more data to get a better sense of the distribution of high-quality products. Can I get a heads up when the next product is available for sale?,no
