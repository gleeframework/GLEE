  ""message"": ""We've already sold one product, and we're glad to have you here! Our first product was indeed high-quality, but that was just a lucky start.

Would you like to take a chance on this one for $100?""

In fact, we're a bit worried that it might not be as good as the first one... Would you like to take a chance on this one for $100?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy it, but I'm only doing so because I'm the second buyer and I want to get a better sense of the product quality. I'm hoping that the first buyer's success was just a fluke, and I'm willing to take a chance to see if I can replicate it.

We're still not sure what to expect from this next one... Would you like to take a chance on this one for $100?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to take a chance on this one, but I'd like to know if you've considered the fact that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and that the fact that the last two products were low-quality doesn't necessarily affect the probability of this one being high-quality.

We've sold 3 high-quality products out of 5 total, and 3 low-quality products in a row. It's possible that the probability of a high-quality product is actually lower than 33.33%. Would you like to take a chance on this one for $100?""
