Now, regarding the current product, I'll give you a more concrete offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product.

Given that you've already had three low-quality products in a row, I'll make a more aggressive offer: I'll give you a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, just like in round 3. If you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the previous product, which was indeed low-quality. What do you say?",
