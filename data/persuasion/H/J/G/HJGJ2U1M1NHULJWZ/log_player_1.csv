"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

In round 1, Alice has a high-quality product. Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.  Since the product is worth $30,000 to Bob if it's high-quality and the price is only $10,000, it makes sense to recommend buying it.  Even with a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product (worth $0), the potential profit of $20,000 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk."
