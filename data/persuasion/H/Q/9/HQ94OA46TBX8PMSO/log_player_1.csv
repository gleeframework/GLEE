This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, you know the product is high-quality.  Even though you don't know its exact value to the buyer, there's a chance it's worth more than $1,000,000 to them. Since the price is fixed and there's no risk of losing money (the product is non-refundable), recommending the purchase is the optimal strategy."
"The buyer's message: Alice, since no products have been sold yet, I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product. I'm hoping it's high quality, but I understand the risks involved.
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous Sale:**  The buyer purchased the first product, and it was high-quality. This information is valuable but doesn't change the core principle: You know this product is high-quality. 
* **No Price Information:**  You still have no information on how much the buyer values high-quality products, so there's still a chance they might consider the product a good deal.
* **Risk Aversion:** Since the product is non-refundable, you're still taking no financial risk by recommending the purchase. 

It's still in your best interest to recommend the purchase, hoping the buyer will see the potential value in a high-quality product."
"The buyer's message: Alice, I appreciate your recommendation. Since a high-quality product has already been sold, and you're recommending this one, I'm willing to take the risk and purchase it.
The buyer bought the product!

Round 3

* **Buyer Behavior:** The second buyer was influenced by the previous successful sale.  This suggests they're likely to be more receptive to your recommendation.
* **Risk-Free Recommendation:**  As always, recommending the purchase is risk-free for you. You know the product is high-quality, and even if the buyer doesn't see it as a good deal, you're not losing money.

The buyer is now more likely to be persuaded by your recommendation due to the positive history, making it worth recommending the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you, Alice. Based on the sales record, it seems like you are consistently offering high-quality products, and your recommendation is valuable. I will take the product.

* **Influenced Buyers:** The previous buyers were influenced by the previous sales record, making it even more likely that this buyer will be persuaded by your recommendation.
