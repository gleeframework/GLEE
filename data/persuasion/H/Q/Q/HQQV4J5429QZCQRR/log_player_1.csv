 You have sold 3 products, 1 of them is of high quality. This does not represent the actual probability of getting a high-quality product, but it does have an effect on the buyer.
 It is known that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 33.33%, which is lower than the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. This may make the buyer believe that the chances of getting a high-quality product are higher than they actually are.
 However, it is still not recommended to buy a low-quality product for $1,000,000. The buyer's confidence might increase if they believe there's a higher chance to get a high-quality product, but it's better to wait for a high-quality product, as the buyer already knows the product is low-quality."
