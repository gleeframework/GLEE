,,Bob,1,"I'll take the product, but I'm not committing to loving it. I just want to see what happens.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"As you've already experienced with the previous product, this one is also a great opportunity to get a refund if you're not satisfied. Plus, think of it as a chance to see the product's quality firsthand and make an informed decision for the next one.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced by the refund offer. I'm starting to think that most of your products are low-quality. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that I have a mix of both high-quality and low-quality products.

I'm not making any claims about its quality, but I'm willing to sell it to you for the standard price of $100. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it because I want to see if the probability is actually 33.33% as you claim. I'm not expecting to get a high-quality product, but I'm curious to see if the odds are in my favor this time.",yes
