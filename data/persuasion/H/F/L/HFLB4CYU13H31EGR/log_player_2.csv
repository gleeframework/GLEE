  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/2, which is 0%. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%, but the lack of sales so far makes it difficult to estimate the quality. However, Alice's recommendation to buy is based on her knowledge of the product's value to me, which is $0 for low-quality products and $125 for high-quality products. Given that Alice's recommendation is to buy, it's likely that she believes the product is high-quality. Nevertheless, I'd rather play it safe and pass on the product for now.""
