high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and would rather not take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on Alice's previous sales record, which doesn't give me any information about the quality of the product. I'd like to make my own decision based on the 50% chance of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can tell me why you're recommending me to pass on it. I want to understand your reasoning."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and the fact that you recommended it. I'd like to know if there are any other buyers who passed on the product before me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think it's more likely to be low-quality given Alice's previous recommendations. If it's high-quality, I'll be happy to buy it, but if it's low-quality, I'll be glad I didn't overpay."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous products were low-quality, so she's trying to sell me a low-quality product. I'll wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $1000000, which would be a great deal for me."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the products after your recommendation, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the product I'm being recommended to buy is low-quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're recommending it. Your recommendation is not a guarantee of the product's quality, but it's a good indicator. If you're not recommending it, I'm assuming it's a low-quality product and I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, which is a suspiciously high proportion. Given Alice's neutral recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that this product is likely low-quality as well. I'll pass on it to avoid the loss."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous 7 buyers all received low-quality products, and the fact that you recommended it suggests that it's likely low-quality as well."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, 7 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product. Given the 50% chance of a product being high quality, it's likely that the remaining products are of low quality. I'll pass on this one."
