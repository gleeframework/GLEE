``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on. Only one product has been sold so far, and it was high quality. This doesn't tell us much about Alice's ability to predict quality.
* **Positive Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a positive signal, even if it's not very informative given the limited data.
* **Potential Upside:** The potential reward of a high-quality product ($400) outweighs the potential loss ($0) if it's low quality, given the 50/50 odds.

**Strategy:**  Since we have no other information to go on, it makes sense to act on the positive recommendation and take a gamble."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Data:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high-quality.
* **Recommendation:** Alice is recommending you buy the product. 
* **Logic:** While there's always a chance the product is low quality, the data heavily suggests it's high quality. The seller's recommendation strengthens this belief.  The potential payoff ($400) significantly outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product."
