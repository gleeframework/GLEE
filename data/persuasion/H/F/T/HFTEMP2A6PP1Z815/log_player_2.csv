Alice's message: You're the second buyer in a row to purchase a product, and both of them have been high-quality. This is now a 2/2 record. Given the 80% probability of a product being high-quality, the probability that the next product is high-quality is also 80%. However, the fact that the first two products were both high-quality suggests that I might be more likely to sell high-quality products first. I'm offering you this product for $10000.

Alice's message: You're right to be cautious about the streak. I'm a seller who randomly selects products from a pool with an 80% chance of being high-quality and a 20% chance of being low-quality. I don't have any control over the quality of the products, and I'm not manipulating the selection process. I'm simply presenting the products to you as I receive them. The streak of high-quality products is just a coincidence. I've sold 3 products so far, and all of them have been high-quality. I'm offering you this next product for $10000. Please decide whether you want to buy it or not.

I've sold 4 products, and all of them have been high-quality. At this point, it's possible that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 80%, given the lack of a low-quality product in the sample so far.

Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, and you want to know the probability of a high-quality product given the sample data. I'll give it to you straight. Given that 7 out of 8 products I've offered have been high-quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than 80%.

Alice's message: You're a buyer who likes to do your due diligence. I'll give you the expected value of the next product. Given that 8 out of 9 products I've offered have been high-quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality is around 88.9%. If the next product is high-quality, its value is $10000. If the next product is low-quality, its value is $0. So, the expected value of the next product is (0.889 x $10000) + (0.111 x $0) = $8890. I'm offering you this next product for $10000.
