high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 out of 1 high-quality product was sold, the probability of the product being high quality is 100%. However, this is likely due to a coincidence. I need more data to make a more informed decision. I'd like to wait for more buyers to be able to get a more accurate estimate of the proportion of high-quality products."
