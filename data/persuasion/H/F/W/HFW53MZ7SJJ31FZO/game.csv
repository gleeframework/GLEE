,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 buyers have passed on the product despite Alice's recommendation, I'm suspicious that the product is low-quality. I'd like to see if the next buyer will buy it, to gather more information about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it? I'd like to make an informed decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous buyers passed on the products, and she's trying to sell a low-quality product to me. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 3 buyers also bought the products after your recommendations, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that your recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products, and I'd rather not take the risk."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0 out of 4, which is a very low proportion. However, since there are only 4 data points, it's not a reliable indicator of the overall quality of the products. I'll take a chance and buy the product to try to get a high-quality one."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's lack of recommendation. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."
