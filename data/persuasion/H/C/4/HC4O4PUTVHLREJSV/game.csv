Will you take advantage of this opportunity and join our satisfied customers?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing so because I'm the first buyer and the initial statistics are skewed. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 30%, but I'm also aware that this is a biased estimate since I'm the first buyer and the sample size is small. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm also aware that future buyers will have a more accurate estimate of the product's quality.",yes

,,Alice,6,"We appreciate your negotiation skills! With 5 high-quality products sold out of 12, our sales data now indicates a 41.67% chance of a product being high-quality. We're impressed by your savvy approach and willing to consider your offer. However, we're not ready to go as low as $900000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950000. This is a 3.33% discount from the original price, considering the increased probability of the product being high-quality. Will you take this offer and join our growing list of satisfied customers?",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still concerned about the risk of getting a low-quality product. I'd like to know more about the sales data.

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"We're happy to clarify our refund policy. If the product is deemed low-quality, we'll provide a refund of 50% of the purchase price, minus any costs associated with the product's creation and distribution.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"We understand your concerns and are happy to provide more transparency. The costs associated with the product's creation and distribution are approximately $200000.

We believe this is a fair and transparent offer. Will you take the chance and join our growing list of customers?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that my decision is based on the provided statistics and the transparency about the costs and refund policy. I'm willing to take the risk because the potential upside of a high-quality product ($1250000) outweighs the potential loss of $300000 if it's low-quality. However, I'd like to request that you provide more information about the product's quality and any quality control measures in place to ensure that the product is not low-quality.",yes

,,the buyer,11,"I appreciate your transparency about your quality control process. However, I'm concerned that 30% of products are discarded, which aligns with the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality.
