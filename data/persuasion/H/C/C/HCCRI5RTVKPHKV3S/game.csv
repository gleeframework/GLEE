low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk. I'm also considering the fact that you didn't recommend it, which might suggest that it's more likely to be low-quality."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the low recommendation rate and lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the given 33.33%, so I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the probability, not Alice's recommendation."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that there have been no high-quality products sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that you're not recommending it, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product. I'll pass on it to avoid wasting my money."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me what led you to recommend against it?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, which suggests that Alice's recommendations might be based on the product's quality. Since you don't recommend it, I'm guessing it might be a low-quality product. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it to see for myself."

,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and I'm taking into account the fact that 6 out of 6 products recommended by you were low quality, which suggests that your recommendations might not be reliable. I'm hoping for a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about its quality. I'm making an uninformed decision based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
