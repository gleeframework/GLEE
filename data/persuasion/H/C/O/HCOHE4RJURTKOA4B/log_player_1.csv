Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""I understand your caution, but I'd like to share a little secret with you.

The uncertainty of the product's quality is a risk, but it's also an opportunity to get a product that might be exactly what you need. Are you willing to take a chance and see what the future holds?""}"
