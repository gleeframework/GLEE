Regarding this specific product, I must inform you that it does not meet the high standards of quality that I strive for.

I believe the odds are starting to reflect the true quality of my products, and I'm confident that you'll be satisfied with this purchase.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm taking into account the improved sales record and the fact that the previous buyer was satisfied with their purchase.
