I know I still don't have any sales history to prove this, but I'm willing to let my future sales speak for themselves. If you're willing to take a chance, I'm offering this product for $10000.

The product is being offered for $10000, but I want to reiterate that it's a high-risk purchase. The product is non-refundable, and there's a 66.67% chance that it's low-quality.
