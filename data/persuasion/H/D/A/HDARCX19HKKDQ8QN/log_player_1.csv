It has a slightly longer warranty period, extending from 10 years to 15 years. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10,000, considering the added value it provides.""
}"
"Bob's message: Alice, the extended warranty period is a nice touch, but as before, the product's quality is my primary concern. Since you've confirmed that it's a high-quality product from the same batch as the previous ones, I'm willing to take the deal at $10000.
