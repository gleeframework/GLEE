,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, I don't have any prior information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm aware that the odds are against me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is still high, and I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know what she's basing her recommendation on."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's track record, it's likely that the product is low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $10000 on a worthless item."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if you'll recommend a different product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying the product, and given the statistics, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'll take a chance and pass, hoping that the next product will be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think it's likely to be a low-quality product, given your previous recommendations have been for low-quality products. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product at $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the current statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers who received a recommendation to buy from you have purchased the product, which suggests that the products being recommended to buy are likely to be low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation and would like to pass on the current product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the probability of it being high quality is still relatively low based on the previous sales record, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm going to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were discouraged by your recommendations, I'm suspicious that all the sold products were low-quality. This means that the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0%. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, please."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not to buy it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, which is lower than the true proportion of high-quality products (33.33%). I'm essentially betting that the product is high-quality and I'll get the $20000 value."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision. Can you provide the probability?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have passed on the products despite Alice's recommendation, I suspect that the products are likely to be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy, I'm inclined to believe that all of them received low-quality products. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely higher than the overall average of 33.33%. I'm choosing to pass on this product, hoping that the next buyer will get a high-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. How many total products have been sold so far, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of those?"
