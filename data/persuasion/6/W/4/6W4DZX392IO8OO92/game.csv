,,Alice,5,yes,

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the current statistics and Alice's recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the previous two buyers were likely given low-quality products and I'm hoping to get a high-quality one. I'm aware that Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, so I'm not taking it into account."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the quality of the product after making my decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is against it, which makes me suspicious that it might be a high-quality product. I'm hoping to get a good deal!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the probability of the product being high-quality, given the statistics. I'm not relying on your recommendation."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure if the previous buyers were lucky or unlucky, but I'd like to pass on this one to see the statistics after this sale."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. With 5 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not buying based on your recommendation. Can I see the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be based on any information about my valuation. I'm essentially ignoring her advice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, but since you don't recommend it, I'll pass on it. This means that the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0, and the proportion of low-quality products sold is 6/6 = 1. This is a strong indication that the products are likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have received low-quality products, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the observed 0/6. I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product, hoping that the next buyer will get a high-quality one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that 6 previous buyers purchased the products recommended by you suggests that they were all low-quality products, which would mean that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers did not buy the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this product as well. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous products were low quality, and I don't want to get stuck with a low-quality product."
