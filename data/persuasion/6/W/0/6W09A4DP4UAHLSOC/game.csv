The guarantee I offered was a one-time thing. This product, however, is not high-quality. I'm being upfront with you about its quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $80. It's still a good value, and I think you'll find it useful despite its limitations.",

But I think it might be useful to you, and it's a good opportunity to get something for a low price. Plus, remember the 10% discount on the next product is still valid, so if you buy this one, you'll get an even better deal on the next one.",
