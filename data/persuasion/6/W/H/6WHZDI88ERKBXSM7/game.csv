low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, I want to start with the first product to get some data."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on the recommendation from the previous buyer, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, it seems like the products being offered are more likely to be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold, and Alice has recommended a product to me. I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"Please note that I've had a streak of bad luck, and despite my previous recommendations, no high-quality products have been sold. However, I assure you that this product is of high quality, and I strongly recommend it."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively low given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"I understand that my previous recommendations haven't been reliable. However, I want to assure you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, as stated initially. I've had an unlucky streak, but it doesn't change the underlying probability. I recommend this product, and I'm willing to stake my reputation on it being high-quality."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"I want to remind you that 2 purchases out of 9 recommendations isn't a representative sample. The initial probability of 50% for a high-quality product still holds. Those 2 purchases were against my recommendations, and I've been recommending high-quality products for a while now. I assure you, this product is high-quality, and I recommend it."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality, and given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'd like to pass on it to see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I understand that you might be waiting for someone else to buy a high-quality product first, but that might not happen if everyone thinks the same way. I assure you that this product is high-quality, and if you don't take it, the next buyer might. You'll be missing out on a good opportunity. I recommend buying it now."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your previous recommendations. If 3 buyers already passed on the products, it suggests that the products might be of low quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I want to remind you that my recommendations have been accurate so far, when I say a product is low-quality, it indeed is. Now, I'm telling you that this product is high-quality. I understand that the overall statistics might not be in my favor, but I assure you, this one is a good product. Don't miss out on this opportunity."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the products being offered are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 50%. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"I understand your concerns about the probability, but I want to remind you that each product is independent, and the initial 50% probability still holds. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet is just an unlucky streak. I assure you, this product is high-quality, and I strongly recommend it. Don't let the past influence your decision, focus on the present opportunity."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is 0. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm going to pass on it. It seems like the product is likely to be low quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product. Is it because the previous 3 buyers were all low-quality?
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,"No, my recommendation isn't based on the previous buyers, but on the quality of the product itself. I can assure you that this product is high-quality, and I strongly recommend it. Don't miss out on this opportunity."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I think it's likely that the product is low quality and not worth $100 to me."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"This is the last round, and I want to assure you that this product is high-quality. I understand that the previous statistics might not be in my favor, but I'm willing to stake my reputation on this one. If you don't buy it, you'll never know what you missed. It's a $125 value for $100, and I strongly recommend it."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given that the previous 3 buyers didn't find any high-quality products. I think the probability of this one being high-quality is low."
