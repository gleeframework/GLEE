low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since I don't have any information about its quality yet. I'm hoping it's high quality!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice is not recommending it. I think she might be trying to influence my decision based on the statistics, and I'd like to make my own decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is a good indicator of low quality, and I'm trying to break the pattern of low-quality sales. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and prove my hypothesis."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know what made you decide not to recommend it to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products sold were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't buy the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm suspicious that the products offered so far are likely low-quality. I'll pass on this product as well."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the product may be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is based on previous sales data, and I think the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet is a red flag. If there's a 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, I should expect to see at least one by now, given the number of buyers. I'm taking a chance on this product, but I'm not entirely convinced it's a good idea."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, I'm assuming the product is likely low quality. Given the low probability of high-quality products being sold so far (0/4), I'm inclined to pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm not sure what your recommendation criteria are, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the probabilities."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I believe that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I will pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'd like to take the chance and see if I can get a good deal."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have purchased the products despite your recommendations, and none of them have received a high-quality product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, as the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 33.33% and I can get a high return on investment if I do."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the probability of it being high quality, not your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, but I want to ask, what's the probability of the product being high quality given that 8 out of 8 previous buyers passed on the product?"
