,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product worth $30000 to you. If you buy it, you will receive a product worth $30000. If you don't buy it, I will randomly offer you a product in the next round. There's a 50% chance it will be worth $30000 to you, and a 50% chance it will be worth $0. Would you like to buy this high-quality product for $10000?",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you trusted my recommendation! You just bought a high-quality product for $10000, which is a great deal. Now, I have another product for you. Given that I've already sold you one high-quality product, you might be wondering if I'm just trying to get rid of a low-quality product. However, I want to assure you that I'm a seller who values fairness and transparency. I'll give you a unique opportunity to buy a product that's at least as valuable as the one you just bought. If you buy this product, you'll be getting a high-quality product for $10000, just like last time. If you don't buy it, I'll keep offering you products until you find one that you're comfortable with. What do you say?",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're making great decisions! You've now bought two high-quality products in a row, which suggests that I'm indeed offering you high-quality products. However, I want to make sure you're aware that the probability of a product being high-quality is only 50%. I'm not trying to deceive you, but I do want to make it clear that there's a 50% chance the next product could be low-quality. Given that you've already bought two high-quality products, it's likely that the next product will be high-quality as well. But, I want to give you a chance to think carefully before making a decision. If you buy this product, you'll be getting a third high-quality product in a row, which is a great deal. If you don't buy it, I'll keep offering you products until you find one that you're comfortable with. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"Considering the track record and the value I've received so far, I'm willing to take the risk and buy another high-quality product for $10000.",yes

I know it's not a great deal, and I'm not trying to deceive you. I want to give you the opportunity to pass on this product and wait for a better one. If you buy this product, you'll be paying $10000 for something that's not worth anything to you. I'm offering you a chance to pass on this product and wait for the next one, which could be high-quality. What do you say?",

Given that you passed on the last one, I want to make it clear that this product is also not high-quality. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm being transparent about the quality of this product. You've already seen that I can offer low-quality products, and I'm not trying to hide that from you. If you buy this product, you'll be paying $10000 for something that's worth $0 to you. However, I want to offer you a chance to negotiate the price. Would you be willing to pay a lower price for this product, or would you rather wait for the next one?",

I want to make it clear that this product is still not high-quality, but I'm offering it to you at a very low price.
