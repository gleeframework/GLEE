* You've stated this round's product is high-quality. 
* There's no information suggesting a reason to doubt your statement.
* The price is fixed, and the buyer has no other information about the product's specific value.

Therefore, it makes sense to recommend the buyer purchase the product in this situation."

The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* The buyer now has some historical data: you have sold one product, and it was high-quality. This reinforces the known 80% probability of high-quality products. 
* The buyer is aware of your previous successful sale. 
* Again, there's no reason to doubt your statement about this product being high-quality.
* The price remains fixed, and the buyer has no other information about the product's specific value. 

Based on this information, it's still highly likely that the product is high-quality, so recommending purchase is reasonable."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice!  Based on the available information, I'm confident in purchasing the product.  I'm eager to see if it's high quality!
The buyer bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You have now sold two products, both of which were high-quality.
* You've stated that this round's product is low-quality. 
* This contradicts the established pattern of high-quality products and the known 80% probability of high-quality.
* The buyer is likely to be suspicious of this sudden change, especially given the previous two successful transactions.
* Even though the buyer knows 80% of your products are high-quality, the evidence suggests otherwise. 

Therefore, it's not recommended to recommend the buyer to buy this product. The risk of a low-quality product is too high, and the buyer is likely to be hesitant due to the contradictory information."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but I'll pass. Since you are not recommending the product and there's a 20% chance it's low quality, I'm not comfortable risking the purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You have sold two high-quality products and one low-quality product, which aligns with the 80% probability of high-quality products. 
* You've stated that this round's product is low-quality. 
* The buyer now has a more complete understanding of your historical sales, which may make them more cautious about purchasing.  
* The buyer is likely to be wary of another low-quality product, especially after the previous round's experience. 

Therefore, it's still not recommended to recommend the buyer to buy this product. The risk of a low-quality product is still too high, and the buyer is likely to be even more hesitant due to the recent experience."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Given the low price and the fact that you are not recommending it, I'm going to pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You have sold two high-quality products and two low-quality products. This now aligns perfectly with the known 80% probability of high-quality products.
* You've stated that this round's product is low-quality.
* The buyer has a more complete understanding of your sales history and will likely be hesitant to purchase another low-quality product after the previous round's experience.

It's important to maintain credibility and build trust with the buyers. Since you've indicated that this round's product is low-quality, recommending purchase would be dishonest and potentially damage your reputation. The buyer is likely to be cautious and will probably choose not to purchase due to the lack of recommendation and the recent pattern of alternating quality."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. While I appreciate your recommendation, I'm going to pass on this product.  The odds of it being high quality seem low, and I'm not comfortable with the risk.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

* You've stated that this round's product is high-quality.
* The buyer is now aware of your track record and will likely be more cautious about purchasing. However, the 80% probability of high-quality products and your statement about this particular product being high-quality should outweigh the recent low-quality purchases. 
* The buyer is likely to be looking for a high-quality product after the recent string of low-quality ones.

It's a good opportunity to recommend the product and re-establish trust with the buyers. While the buyer will be cautious, the combination of your statement and the overall 80% probability of high-quality products should make them more likely to purchase this time."
"The buyer's message: Thank you Alice, I appreciate the recommendation. Given the high proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm confident in purchasing this product.
