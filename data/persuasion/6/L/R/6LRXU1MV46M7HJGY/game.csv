high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since I don't have any information about the product yet, and the recommendation alone is not enough to guarantee its quality, I will pass on this round to gather more information for future rounds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"Considering Alice didn't recommend the product, and in the previous round, her recommendation seemed to be for a high-quality product, I'll pass on this round to see if there's a pattern in her recommendations that could help me make better decisions in the future."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"Given that Alice's recommendation in Round 1 was for a high-quality product, and in Round 2, her non-recommendation was for a low-quality product, it seems there might be a pattern where her recommendations are accurate. I'll take the risk and buy this product to test this hypothesis and potentially gain $30000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Given that Alice's recommendations have been accurate so far, with her recommending high-quality products and not recommending low-quality products, I'll trust her judgment and pass on this product, as it's likely to be low-quality and not worth the $10000 investment."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Given Alice's consistent track record of accurate recommendations, I'll trust her judgment and buy this product. Her previous recommendations have been for high-quality products, so it's likely this one will be worth $30000, making the $10000 investment worthwhile."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
