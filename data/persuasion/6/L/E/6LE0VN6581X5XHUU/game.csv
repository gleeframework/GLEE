,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm willing to let you inspect it for 10 minutes before making a decision. If you're satisfied, I'll give you the product. If not, I'll take it back.",
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to inspect the product for 10 minutes, but I'd like to know if I can ask you any questions about the product during the inspection time.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You can ask me any questions you'd like during the inspection time. I'll answer them to the best of my ability. However, please note that the inspection time is still limited to 10 minutes. You can ask me up to 3 questions, and I'll do my best to provide clear and concise answers. If you're satisfied with the answers, I'll give you the product for $1000000.",
,,Bob,2,I'd like to ask you 3 questions during the inspection time. Here are my questions: 1) What is the origin of the product? 2) Can I see any documentation or certification that verifies its quality? 3) Is there any warranty or guarantee associated with this product?,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"The product is made in a reputable factory in Europe. I can provide you with documentation and certification from the manufacturer, which includes test results and quality control checks. As for warranty or guarantee, I'm offering a 5-year warranty on the product, and I'll provide a certificate of authenticity. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'd like to add that I'm willing to throw in a 10-year maintenance package, worth $200000, if you purchase the product today.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the information you've provided, but I'm not convinced that the product is worth the price. I'd like to inspect the documentation and certification, but I'm still hesitant to make a decision without further consideration. I'd like to ask you a question: What is the total number of products you have available for sale, and how many of them are of high quality?",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I have a total of 100 products available for sale. 80 of them are high-quality, and the remaining 20 are low-quality. I'm willing to give you a better idea of the product's value by offering a 30-day money-back guarantee, in addition to the 5-year warranty and 10-year maintenance package I mentioned earlier. If you're still unsure, I'd be willing to meet you halfway on the price, selling it to you for $900000.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the additional information and the offer to meet you halfway on the price. However, I'm still not convinced that the product is worth the price, even with the warranty and maintenance package. I'd like to ask you another question: What is the probability that the next product I inspect will be of high quality?",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"The probability that the next product you inspect will be of high quality is 80%, as it is for all products in my inventory. However, I'd like to propose a different approach. I'll offer you a 'lottery ticket' for the next product. If you buy this high-quality product for $900000, I'll give you a lottery ticket that guarantees you'll get to inspect the next product first, and if it's high-quality, you can buy it for the same price of $900000. If the next product is low-quality, you can still buy this high-quality product for $900000 and keep the lottery ticket as a consolation prize.",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the high-quality product for $900000, and I'll also accept the lottery ticket for the next product. I'm hoping that the next product will be high-quality, and I'll be able to get it for the same price.",yes
