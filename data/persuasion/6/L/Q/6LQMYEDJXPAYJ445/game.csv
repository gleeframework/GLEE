high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/1, which is 0%.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,

Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy, but no high-quality products have been sold yet, it suggests that the first product was likely low quality. If I buy, I'll be relying on the assumption that the current product is high quality, but I'd rather wait and see how the pattern develops before committing to a purchase."
