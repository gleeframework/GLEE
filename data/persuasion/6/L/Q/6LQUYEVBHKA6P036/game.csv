,,the buyer,20,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm and the various incentives, I'm still hesitant to be the first buyer without any prior sales data to rely on. I'm also concerned about the potential loss of $1000000 if the product turns out to be low quality. I'll wait and see if others are willing to take the leap first. I'll be sure to check back later to see if any sales have been made. Good luck with your sales!",no
