Alice's message: I'd be happy to provide you with the probability! Based on the current sales record, the probability of a product being high-quality is 2/3.

If it's not, I'll refund your money. Would you like to take advantage of this offer and buy this high-quality product for $100?

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I apologize for any confusion. You are correct that the probability I mentioned earlier is based on a small sample size. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually 50%, as it's a random process. I'm willing to be transparent about this.

Since the first buyer didn't buy, I've sold a total of 5 products, with 3 being high-quality and 2 being low-quality.
