"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'm confident you'll love it, but if you're not sure, I can offer you a chance to inspect it before making a decision. Would you like to take a closer look?

Round 2
Alice's message: I see you were interested in inspecting the previous product. This one is a bit different. I'm not making any promises, but I'll let you know that this product has some flaws that might affect its performance. It's still a good value at $10000, but I'm willing to throw in a small discount... no, scratch that. I'll keep the price at $10000. It's a great opportunity to get a product that's still worth something, but at a lower price than it could have been. What do you say?

I've had excellent feedback from other customers, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. I'll even give you a bit of a nudge: I've had to turn down a few other interested buyers because they were willing to pay more than $10000. So, if you're interested, I'm willing to make a deal. But if you're not, I'll just move on to the next buyer.

But, I'm willing to let it go for $10000, and I'll even throw in a warranty that covers any potential issues.

I'll give you a discount, but not on the price. I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and you're not completely satisfied with it, I'll replace it with a new one of equal or greater value.
