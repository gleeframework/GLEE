Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob knows the product is likely to be high-quality, he has no way of knowing for sure until after the purchase.  Since the price is fixed and the product is non-refundable, it's still in Bob's best interest to buy the product. There's an 80% chance he'll get a high-quality product, which could be worth more than $100 to him."
