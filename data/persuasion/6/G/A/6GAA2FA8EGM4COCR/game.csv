high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and the probability of it being high-quality is only 80.00%, which is not high enough for me to take the risk of losing $10000 for a potentially worthless product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and the probability of it being low-quality is 20%, which is too high for me to take the risk of buying it for $10000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not going to buy the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she has already sold one high-quality product and wants to sell another one. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer will get a better deal.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 2 purchases, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 50%, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%).
