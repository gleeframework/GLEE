I must inform you that, as stated in the initial conditions, the product is non-refundable after purchase, regardless of its quality. This is a firm policy.

You can also consider the fact that one product has been sold so far, but I won't disclose its quality. The price remains fixed at $1000000. It's a high-risk, high-reward opportunity.

Alice's message: Hello! So far, six buyers have been offered the product, and two of them have decided to buy it, one in Round 1 and one in Round 4. I want to address a common concern: while it's true that I haven't confirmed any high-quality products being sold, it's also true that the buyers who purchased the products haven't returned to share their experiences. You shouldn't assume that the products sold so far are low-quality. Each round is an independent event, and this product has a 50% chance of being high-quality. Don't let the previous rounds influence your decision too much. Focus on the potential gain and make a decision based on the information you have. This product could be worth $2000000, and the price remains fixed at $1000000.
