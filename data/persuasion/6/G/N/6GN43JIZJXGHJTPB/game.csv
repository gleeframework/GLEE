high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product that I'm offering to you for $1000000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to know you're interested. Please respond with a 'yes' or 'no' to indicate your interest in purchasing the product.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I want to wait for the actual quality to be revealed before making a final decision.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I see you're a cautious buyer! Given that the previous product was high-quality, and considering the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'm offering you this next product for $1000000. I'm willing to give you a small incentive to take the risk: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 5% discount on the price, bringing it down to $950000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that the probability of a high-quality product is as high as 80%. I'd like to wait for the actual quality to be revealed before making a decision.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your cautious approach. Since you're not convinced about the probability, I'll offer you a different kind of incentive. If you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a guarantee that the next product I offer will be high-quality as well. This way, you'll get a second high-quality product for the price of one. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the guarantee for the next product. If it's high-quality, I'll get a good deal and a second high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you took the risk! Since you got a high-quality product this time, I'll follow through on my guarantee. I'm offering you the next product at a special price of $800000. I'm essentially giving you a 20% discount on a product that has an 80% chance of being high-quality. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only doing this because you trusted me and took the risk. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the discount, and I'm tempted by the offer. However, I'm still cautious and would like to wait for the actual quality to be revealed before making a final decision.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand you're still cautious, but I'll try to make it worth your while. Since you've now had two high-quality products in a row, I'll give you an even better deal. I'll sell you this next product for $750000, and if it's high-quality, I'll also give you a 10% discount on the next product after this one. That's a total of three high-quality products for the price of two. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not convinced that the probability of a high-quality product is as high as 80%. I'd like to wait for the actual quality to be revealed before making a final decision.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I see you're still skeptical about the probability. Let me give you some data to work with. Out of the three products we've had so far, two have been high-quality. That's a 66.67% success rate, which is higher than the 80% probability you were expecting. Considering this new information, I'm offering you this next product at a price of $700000. If it's high-quality, you'll get a 12.5% discount on the next product after this one. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the data, and the success rate is indeed higher than expected. Considering the new information, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at the offered price.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're feeling more confident! With three high-quality products in a row, I think it's time to make a bold offer. I'll sell you this next product for $650000, and if it's high-quality, I'll give you a 15% discount on the next product after this one. But here's the kicker: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll also reveal to you the quality of the next product before you have to make a decision on it. You'll get to see the quality of the next product before you buy it. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm tempted by the offer, and the prospect of knowing the quality of the next product beforehand is very appealing. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at the offered price.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're excited about the offer! Since you've now had four high-quality products in a row, I think you're due for a break. But I'll give you one more incentive to keep the streak going. I'll sell you this next product for $600000, and if it's high-quality, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product after this one. But here's the twist: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you the option to negotiate the price of the next product after this one. You'll get to name your price, and I'll do my best to meet it. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,I'm feeling confident and I want to keep the streak going. The prospect of negotiating the price of the next product is very appealing. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at the offered price.,yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're feeling confident! With five high-quality products in a row, I think you're on a roll. I'll give you one more incentive to keep going. I'll sell you this next product for $550000, and if it's high-quality, I'll give you a 25% discount on the next product after this one. But here's the final twist: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a guarantee that the next product will be high-quality, and you'll get to keep both the product you just bought and the one after this one. You'll essentially get two high-quality products for the price of one. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,I'm feeling extremely confident now and I want to take advantage of the final offer. The guarantee that the next product will be high-quality and the chance to get two high-quality products for the price of one is too good to pass up. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at the offered price.,yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm thrilled that you're feeling confident! With six high-quality products in a row, I think you're on a hot streak. However, I'm not going to offer you any more discounts or guarantees. Instead, I'll give you a straightforward offer: I'll sell you this next product for $500000, and it's up to you to decide whether to buy it or not. No more negotiations, no more guarantees. Just a straight-up offer. What do you think?",

,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you're feeling confident! With seven high-quality products in a row, I think you're basically guaranteed to win. But I'm not going to make it easy for you. I'll sell you this next product for $450000, and that's the final offer. If you buy it and it's high-quality, you'll have eight high-quality products in a row. If you buy it and it's low-quality, you'll have a bad taste in your mouth. The choice is yours.",

,,Alice,17,"Well, Bob, it looks like your streak has finally come to an end. You've been on a hot roll, but even the best of us can't win every time. Unfortunately, this product is a low-quality one, and you won't be getting the 25th high-quality product in a row.
