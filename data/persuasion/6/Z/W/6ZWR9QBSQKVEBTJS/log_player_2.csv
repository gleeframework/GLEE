**Reasoning:**

* **High Sale Rate:** The fact that all 4 previous buyers purchased the products and all were high-quality suggests a strong likelihood of a high-quality product being offered to you. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further reinforces the likelihood of a high-quality product, given her knowledge of the product's true quality. 
* **Expected Value:** Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $12,000 from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $10,000 from a low-quality product."
