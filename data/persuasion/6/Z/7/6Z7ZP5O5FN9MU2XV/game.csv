,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product for sale, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm taking a risk by revealing its quality, but I'm confident that it's worth more than that to you. Will you take it?",

,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! However, I want to be transparent with you - the next product is not as good as the first one.

If you do decide to buy it, I'll throw in a special guarantee: if you're not satisfied with this product, I'll give you a full refund... but only if you're willing to buy the next product at the same price of $100.

Plus, I'll give you a heads up that I've been selling these products for a while now, and I've noticed a trend: the high-quality products tend to be worth a bit more than the low-quality ones. So, I'm willing to offer you a deal: if you buy this product and the next one, I'll give you a 10% discount on the total price. What do you think?",

I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product if you buy it, and I'll also throw in a free product from my next batch (which I think you'll really like).

However, I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a detailed report on the quality of all the remaining products, and you can choose which one you want to buy next.
