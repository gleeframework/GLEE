,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, since there's no information to go on yet. I'm not influenced by your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I want to know why you don't recommend it. Is there a reason you think it's low quality?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to pass on this one."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of your previous recommendations, and I'd like to see the product for myself."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous buyers purchased the high-quality products, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me. Can you provide that information based on the statistics so far? I'd like to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm the 4th buyer and I want to take a chance to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and since no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'd like to pass on this one to see if you can sell the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $10000, which is a good deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the fact that you're not recommending it. Your lack of recommendation suggests that the product might be low-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk since I don't have any information to the contrary."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to take the risk. If you're not recommending it, it's probably low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that this product might be low-quality as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. Given the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'm hoping to catch a high-quality product that others have missed."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 buyers have already been offered the product and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products changes."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. I think this might be a low-quality product, and I'm hoping to get it for $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products sold have been high-quality. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there have been no high-quality products sold so far, so it's likely that the product is low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your previous recommendations have been 0/8, suggesting a high-quality product is unlikely to be sold. I'd like to know if you can provide any additional information about the previous buyers or the product itself that might change my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and 0 high-quality products have been sold. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 8 out of 8 buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since all 8 previous buyers passed, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'll pass on the product."
