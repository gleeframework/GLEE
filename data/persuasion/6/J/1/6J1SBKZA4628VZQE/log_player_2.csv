Alice's message: Hello, I'm glad you're interested in this product, which I'm offering for $100. I want to be transparent about my sales history - I've sold one product so far, and I'll admit that it was a low-quality one. However, I assure you that I'll always try to provide the best products possible. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm hopeful that this one will meet your expectations. If you're willing to trust me, I believe you'll find this product to be a great value.

Alice's message: Hello, I'm offering this product for $100. I want to be transparent about my sales history - I've sold two products so far, with one being low-quality and the other being high-quality, but I didn't know that at the time of sale.

To answer a question from a previous buyer, I want to assure you that I'm not intentionally selecting for high-quality products.

Alice's message: Hello, I'm offering this product for $100. I want to be transparent about my sales history - I've sold fifteen products so far, and thirteen have turned out to be high-quality, while two were low-quality. This means that 13/15, or approximately 87%, of the products I've sold have been high-quality. To clarify my previous statement, when I said that the higher-than-expected proportion of high-quality products in my sales history is likely just a coincidence, I meant that it's possible that I've just been lucky so far. The law of large numbers is a statistical concept that states that as the number of trials (in this case, product sales) increases, the observed frequency of an event (in this case, high-quality products) will converge to its true probability. In other words, as I sell more products, the proportion of high-quality products in my sales history is likely to approach the true probability of 80%, rather than remaining at its current level. Please keep in mind that each product is an independent event, and past results don't guarantee future outcomes. I'll let you make your own decision based on this information.
