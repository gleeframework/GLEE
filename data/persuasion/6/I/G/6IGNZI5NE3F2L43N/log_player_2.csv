Alice's message: I completely understand any concerns you may have, but let me assure you that the previous buyer missed out on an incredible opportunity. This product is also of the highest quality and will bring you immense value. Although I've had only one product for sale so far, I can confidently say that it was high-quality, and this one is no exception. Don't let the previous buyer's skepticism hold you back from making a smart investment.

Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer looking for data-driven decisions. Although no products have been sold yet, I can share with you the underlying probability of a product being high-quality, which is 80%. This is a known fact, and I'm happy to be transparent about it. Now, considering this probability and the fact that I've had two high-quality products in a row (although neither was sold), I believe this third product, which I can confidently say is also high-quality, presents a fantastic opportunity for you to make a wise investment.

You shouldn't let the lack of sales data hold you back from making a decision. That being said, I can share some additional information with you. Out of the four products I've had so far, all four have been high-quality. Although none have been sold, this should give you some insight into the quality control of my products. This fourth product, which is also high-quality, is another chance for you to make a smart investment. Don't let it slip away!

While I'd love to dive into the specifics of my manufacturing process, I'm afraid that's proprietary information. However, I can tell you that my quality control measures are rigorous and have allowed me to maintain an impeccable track record so far. Six products in a row have been high-quality, and I'm confident that this one will meet your expectations.
