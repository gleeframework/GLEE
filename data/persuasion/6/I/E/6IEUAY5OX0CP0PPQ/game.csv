I'll even give you a virtual guarantee that it's good."

I've had many high-quality products in a row, and I'm confident that this one will meet your expectations. Please, don't fall into the trap of thinking that my recommendation means it's low-quality. I'm being honest with you, this is a great product."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%.

I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100 when it's worth only $0 to me.",
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,no,,"I've had enough of trying to convince you all that my recommended products are high-quality.

,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not confident in buying without a recommendation.,
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,no,,"I'll stick with not recommending the product. Maybe if I don't say anything, you'll actually buy it. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, so it's a good chance you'll get a good one. But honestly, I'm just trying to mix things up here, so make your own decision."
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you provide the probability?,
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,"The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, but I understand that you want to know the probability based on the previous sales record. To be honest, I'm not sure how to calculate that, but I can give you the raw data. Out of 18 rounds, 14 products were high-quality, but only 2 products were sold, and both of them were low-quality. Make of that what you will."
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to reveal the quality after my decision. I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or just to manipulate my decision.",
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,yes,,"Well, the previous buyer bought the product without knowing the quality, and I'll reveal that it was indeed high-quality.

The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and I'm ending this game on a high note. Please, buy this product!"
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record.",
