low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on the product to avoid the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that all previous buyers passed, which may indicate that the products sold so far were low quality."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 5 buyers have been offered the product and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as there have been 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected, so I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers did not buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product has decreased. I'm going to pass on the product to see if it's a high-quality one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
