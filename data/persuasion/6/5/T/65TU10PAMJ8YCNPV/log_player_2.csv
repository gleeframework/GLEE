Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product and 2 low-quality products so far. I've learned that the previous two products were low-quality, which might suggest that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%.

I'm willing to offer you a special deal: I'll sell this product to you for $900000. It's a 10% discount from the original price, and it's only available to you because I want to move this product quickly. What do you think?

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism. I want to provide some context: the first product was a one-time anomaly, and the next two were just a coincidence. I've sold 1 high-quality product and 4 low-quality products so far. I'm willing to offer you a'reverse auction' deal: I'll sell this product to you for the price you think it's worth, and I'll accept your bid.

Alice's message: I've sold 3 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products so far. I want to provide a more nuanced view: the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%, but the fact that the last two products were high-quality suggests that the next product might be more likely to be low-quality. I'm willing to offer you a 'halftime deal': I'll sell this product to you for $800000, which is 20% off the original price.

Alice's message: I've sold 4 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products so far. Given the sequence of products, I can provide a Bayesian update on the probability of a product being high-quality. Assuming a uniform prior probability of 50%, the posterior probability of a product being high-quality, given 4 high-quality products out of 9 total products sold, is approximately 53.8%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, which is the original price. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?

Alice's message: I've sold 6 high-quality products and 7 low-quality products so far. The confidence interval for the probability of a product being high-quality, based on a Bayesian update with a uniform prior and a binomial likelihood, is approximately (44.1%, 63.5%).
