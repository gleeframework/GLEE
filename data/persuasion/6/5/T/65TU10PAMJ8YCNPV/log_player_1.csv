It's a 10% discount from the original price, and it's only available to you because I want to move this product quickly. What do you think?""

  ""message"": ""I've sold 3 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products so far. I want to provide a more nuanced view: the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%, but the fact that the last two products were high-quality suggests that the next product might be more likely to be low-quality. I'm willing to offer you a 'halftime deal': I'll sell this product to you for $800,000, which is 20% off the original price.
