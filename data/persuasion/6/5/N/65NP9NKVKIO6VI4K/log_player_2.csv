**Reasoning:**

While the odds are stacked against me (66.67% chance of low quality),  here's why I'm taking the risk:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice knows the true quality of the product. Her recommendation to buy suggests it's likely high quality, especially since she has a vested interest in selling. 
* **Previous Data:**  The fact that a high-quality product was sold to the previous buyer suggests a slightly higher chance of another high-quality product being offered. 
* **Potential Reward:**  The potential reward of $400 outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

**Important Note:**  This decision is based on limited information and a bit of gamble.  In reality, I would want to know more about Alice's track record and potentially ask for some additional information before making a purchase."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows that all 4 previous buyers who purchased based on Alice's recommendations received high-quality products. This suggests a strong correlation between Alice's recommendation and product quality.
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the true value of each product. Her recommendation, coupled with the high success rate, strongly indicates this is a high-quality product.
* **Potential Gain:**  A high-quality product is worth $400 to me, while the cost is only $100. This represents a significant potential gain.

**Overall:** Given the information available, the decision to buy is a high-reward, low-risk choice."
