,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share the probability with me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would be a good opportunity for me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the previous sales record, it seems that only 2 out of 6 products sold were high-quality. This is lower than the expected 50% chance of a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but I've seen that 2 out of 6 previous buyers purchased the product, which suggests a relatively high proportion of high-quality products. However, Alice's recommendation not to buy makes me hesitant. I'd like to pass on this one and see what happens next."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 6, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the proportion of high-quality products improves."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the fact that you recommended it, which doesn't give me any information about the product's quality. I'm hoping that the pattern of recommendations might give me some insight."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know whether it's high-quality or low-quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on your previous recommendations. I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the quality of the product, though."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that you recommended it. This makes me think that the product might be low quality, since you only recommended it and 8 out of 8 previous buyers bought the products you recommended. This is a 100% recommendation rate, which is suspiciously high, especially considering that there's a 50% chance of a product being low quality. I'd rather wait for a more balanced recommendation or pass on this one."
