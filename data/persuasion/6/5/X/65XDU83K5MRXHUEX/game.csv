low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I don't have any information about the quality of the product, so I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't have any information about its quality and Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers did not buy the product and both were low-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. Given the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%, I'll pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm doing this because the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I think it's more likely that the product I'm offered is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers bought the product after your recommendation, it suggests that the product might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the pattern holds."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to overpay for a low-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 buyers have purchased and all of them were low-quality products, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it, considering the low quality of products sold so far and your recommendation."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because you're not recommending it. I'm trying to find a high-quality product that you wouldn't recommend, and since you're not recommending it, I'm taking the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not buying. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the probability of the current product being high-quality is low. I'd like to pass and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the products recommended by you, and none of the products sold were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,14,yes,
