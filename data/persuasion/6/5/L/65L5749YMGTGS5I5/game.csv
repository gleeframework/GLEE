high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of the first 2 products were low quality, and you're recommending me to buy, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that you've recommended against it. I'm hoping that the low sales so far are just a coincidence and the probability of a high-quality product hasn't decreased."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, it seems that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than the prior 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, and given that 4 previous buyers were also not recommended and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the probability of the product being high quality, since you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite your warning."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all the previous buyers were discouraged by Alice's recommendations, which suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm inclined to trust Alice's advice and assume that this product might be low-quality as well. I'd rather wait for a product that Alice recommends, which might increase the likelihood of getting a high-quality one."
