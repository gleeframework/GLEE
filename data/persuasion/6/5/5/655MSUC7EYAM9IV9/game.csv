,,Alice,2,"We've had one potential buyer pass on our first product, but that's not a good indicator of the quality of our products. In fact, our products are 33.33% high-quality and 66.67% low-quality, as stated in our company policy. This product is one of the lower-quality ones, but you can get it for a steal at $100. It's a risk, but it could be a great opportunity to get a product at a low price!",

It's a risk, but it's a chance to get a product at a low price!",

,,Alice,4,"We've had three potential buyers pass on our products so far, and two of them were low-quality. We want to be upfront with you - we're 2 for 2 on low-quality products.

We're still offering it to you for $100.",
