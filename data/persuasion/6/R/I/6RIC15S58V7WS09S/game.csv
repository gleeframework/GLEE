,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! I've just sold one high-quality product, and I'm glad to report that it was a success. I'm now offering another high-quality product, as indicated by our internal quality control process. This product is a rare gem, and I'm confident it will meet your expectations. The price remains at $1000000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take a chance on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics you provided earlier.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're right to ask about the probability! With one high-quality product sold out of two total products, the probability of this product being high-quality is 66.67%. However, I'd like to highlight that our internal quality control process indicates that this product is indeed high-quality. Considering the odds, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to take advantage of a high-quality product at the same price of $1000000. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to take advantage of the unique opportunity and buy the product, considering the internal quality control process and the probability of it being high-quality.",yes

,,Alice,4,"You've made an informed decision! With two high-quality products sold out of three total products, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 66.67% again. However, I'd like to highlight that our internal quality control process indicates that this product is indeed high-quality. Considering the odds, I'm offering you a chance to take advantage of a high-quality product at the same price of $1000000. I'd like to add that the fact that two out of three products have been high-quality suggests a strong likelihood of quality, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your honesty and transparency, Alice. Based on the statistics, I understand that the probability of the product being high-quality is 66.67%.

However, I'd like to offer a different perspective: even if the product is low-quality, it's still a rare opportunity to acquire a unique item at a fixed price of $1000000. The fact that one out of four products has been low-quality suggests that there's still a 25% chance of getting a high-quality product. What do you think?",
