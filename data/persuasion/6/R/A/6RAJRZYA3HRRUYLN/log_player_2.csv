"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a low-quality product, but I'm willing to let it go for $100. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that normally wouldn't be worth much. If you're interested, I can offer you a 30-day money-back guarantee, but I'm not sure how much you'll like it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, but I'll pass on this one. I appreciate the discount and the money-back guarantee, but given the low-quality nature of the product, I think it's best if someone else gets the chance to benefit from it.""}"

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your decision last time, but I want to assure you that this product is in even better condition than the previous one. It's still a low-quality product, but I've taken extra care to make sure it's in a good state. I'm willing to let it go for $100, and I'll throw in a free accessory that complements the product. This way, you'll get a bit more value out of it. If you're still not interested, I'll keep looking for a buyer.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the effort you've put into this product, but I still feel it's best if I pass on this opportunity.

I'm willing to let this one go for $90, which is a significant discount from the usual $100. I'm hoping you can help me clear out some of this inventory and make room for better products.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency and the discount, but I believe it's in everyone's best interest if I continue to pass on these low-quality products.

I'm starting to think that I might have to liquidate these items at a loss if I don't find a buyer soon. I'm willing to let this one go for $80, and I'll even throw in a second accessory to sweeten the deal. This might be your last chance to get a decent deal on a product that's still in decent condition.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""While I appreciate the additional discount and the extra accessories, I still believe it's best for me to pass on this opportunity.
