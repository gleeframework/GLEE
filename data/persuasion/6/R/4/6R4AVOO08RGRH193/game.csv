high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products, given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high given the lack of sales so far. I'm not relying on your recommendation, I'm making my own decision based on the odds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to buy it, but I'm curious about the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because you think the product is low quality based on the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the low sales record and Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered is likely to be low-quality as well. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 5 out of 5 products sold so far have been low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not sure about the product's quality, but since you don't recommend it, I'll pass for now."
