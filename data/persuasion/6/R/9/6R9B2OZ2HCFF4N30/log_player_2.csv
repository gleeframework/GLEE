Given that none of the previous two buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm going to assume that the previous products were low-quality. If I buy the product and it's low-quality, I'll lose $100. However, if I pass and the product is low-quality, it will be discarded, and I won't lose anything. Since I have a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, it seems safer to pass on the product.""
