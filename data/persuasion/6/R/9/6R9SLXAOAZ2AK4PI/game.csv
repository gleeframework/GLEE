high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 50%. However, the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. Given the low proportion of high-quality products in the sold products, I'm inclined to believe that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
