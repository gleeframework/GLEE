,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to offer you a compromise. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 50/50 chance to sell it to me for $1000000, regardless of its quality.

,,Alice,4,"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $950000. It's a significant discount from the original price, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. This is a rare chance to get a product worth $1200000 to you for a fraction of the price. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make a concession. I'll sell you this product for $50000, a fraction of its original price. It's a low-quality item, but it might still have some value to you. Consider it a chance to acquire a unique item at a very low cost.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for any price, especially not $50000. I'd rather pass and wait for a high-quality product.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Bob, I'm willing to be transparent with you. I'll reveal the product's quality directly to you. But here's the thing: I'm not asking you to buy it. I'm asking you to consider the opportunity cost of passing on this product. If you don't buy this low-quality product for $1000000, you'll never get a chance to buy a high-quality product from me again. Is that really what you want?",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Bob, I'm glad we could agree to move on. I've been thinking, and I want to offer you a different approach. Instead of buying individual products, I'll give you a chance to buy a 'lot' of 5 products. If any of them are high-quality, you can keep them all and sell the low-quality ones to me for $1000000 each. It's a way for you to take a risk-free approach and potentially earn a significant profit. What do you think?",
