However, I can offer you a unique opportunity to get a sense of the overall quality of my products. If you're interested in purchasing, I'll provide you with the product's quality after the sale.

Alice's message: Welcome to the second round! I appreciate your diligence in clarifying the market value of my products. I'm glad to report that you've set a precedent for the market value of my products at $1000000. As for this new product, I can tell you that it's high-quality, which is a great opportunity for you to get a head start on the market. However, I want to caution you that the quality of my products is not guaranteed, and you should be aware that 2 out of 2 products sold so far have been low-quality.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your cautious approach. I'd like to provide some context: out of 2 products sold, 1 was high-quality, and 1 was low-quality. This new product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to provide some additional information to alleviate your concerns. Since the first product was low-quality, and the second product is also high-quality, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product might be higher than the overall probability of 33.33%.
