low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about the previous sales and I'm taking a risk based on Alice's recommendation. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm aware that the probability is 50%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far is a strong indication that the remaining products are likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 products were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to pass on it for now and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm inclined to think that the products are more likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $100 on a product that's not worth anything to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the products? Were they all recommended to buy?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous three buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that none of the previous buyers who bought a product were able to get a high-quality one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product at $100, which would be worthless to me."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous sales record shows 0 high-quality products have been sold, and the recommendation from Alice is not a strong indicator of the product's quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a contrarian, and I think the fact that you're not recommending it might actually make it more likely to be a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 products were low quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I think there's a high chance this one is also low quality."

,,Alice,19,no,
