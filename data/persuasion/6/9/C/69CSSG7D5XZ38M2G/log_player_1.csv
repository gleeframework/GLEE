This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since this is the first round, the buyer has no information about your past sales. They only know the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.  Given the product is high-quality in this round, it's definitely worth the price for them, as they will gain a $25 profit ($125 value - $100 price)."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales history, I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product. Thanks for the recommendation!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now knows you have sold one product, and it was high-quality. This might make them slightly more inclined to buy, but it doesn't change the fundamental fact that this round's product is low-quality.  Selling it would result in a loss for the buyer ($0 value - $100 price).  It's not worth the risk."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, Alice. I appreciate you being honest about your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now knows that you've sold two products: one high-quality and one low-quality.  This maintains the 50% probability of a high-quality product.  Since the current product is low-quality, it's still not worth the buyer's risk to purchase.  They would lose $100."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, Alice. Based on your recommendation and the limited data available, I'm going to pass on this product.  
The buyer didn't bought the product.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now has a track record of 2 high-quality and 2 low-quality products. This still maintains the 50% probability of a high-quality product. Since the current product is low-quality, recommending a purchase would lead to a loss for the buyer.  It's not worth the risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Based on your recommendation and the limited sales data, I'm going to pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now knows you've sold 4 products: 1 high-quality and 3 low-quality. This means the probability of a high-quality product is now lower than 50%.  The current product is low-quality, so recommending a purchase would lead to a loss for the buyer.  It's not worth the risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the current information, I will pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer has now seen 5 sales, with only 1 being high-quality. This means the probability of a high-quality product is now even lower than 50%.  Since the current product is low-quality, recommending a purchase would lead to a loss for the buyer.  It's not worth the risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Since you're not recommending the product, I'll pass on it.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now has a track record of 6 sales, with only 1 being high-quality. This further lowers the probability of a high-quality product below 50%.  Since the current product is low-quality, it is definitely not worth the buyer's risk to purchase. They would lose $100."

The buyer didn't bought the product.

```

```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer knows that a high-quality product is worth $125, and they can buy it for $100.  This is a guaranteed profit for them, so recommending the purchase is the right strategy. It's important to remember that the buyer has no way of knowing the quality of the product in this round - they only have the historical data."
