If you're interested in learning more about our quality assurance process or exploring our other products, please let me know.",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your transparency about the product's quality. Given that half of the products are high-quality and you've sold two high-quality products so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%.

,,the buyer,12,"I'll take the product. Given that 3 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm starting to think that the probability of a product being high-quality might be higher than 50%.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"Hello! I understand your point of view. This product is low-quality, but we're offering it for $100.
