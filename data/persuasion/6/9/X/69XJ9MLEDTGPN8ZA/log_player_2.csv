Alice's message: I'm glad you were able to secure a great deal earlier! As for this new product, I want to be upfront with you - I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and the law of averages suggests that the next one might not be as lucky.

Alice's message: No worries at all! I completely understand your decision. Let me put it this way: with 2 low-quality products in a row, the probability of the next one being high-quality is actually higher than you might think.
