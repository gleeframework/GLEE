Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 11 so far, and it was the one you just bought. I'm glad you took the chance! As for your question, I can tell you that the probability of a high-quality product being sold to you remains 33.33%, unaffected by the previous sales record. However, I can offer you a more nuanced perspective: if we assume that the previous 10 sales were all independent events, the probability of a high-quality product being sold to you in the next round is still 33.33%. But, if we consider the fact that the previous 10 sales were all low-quality, it's possible that the probability of a high-quality product being sold to you might be lower.

Alice's message: I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 15 so far. You're on a roll! I'm glad you're interested in the bulk discount. As for the probability of the next products being high-quality, I can tell you that the probability remains 33.33% for each individual product. However, I can offer you a more nuanced perspective: given that we've sold 2 high-quality products in the last two rounds, it's possible that the probability of a high-quality product being sold to you might be slightly higher than 33.33% for the next few rounds. But, I want to caution you that this is just speculation, and each product is still an independent event. I'm still offering you the bulk discount, and I'm willing to sell you the next product for 20% off. What do you say?
