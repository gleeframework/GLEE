,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 out of the first buyer has purchased and that product was low quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the previous two buyers didn't get high-quality products, and she's trying to sell me a low-quality product to get rid of it."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased since all previous buyers passed on the products, and she only recommended the product to me.
