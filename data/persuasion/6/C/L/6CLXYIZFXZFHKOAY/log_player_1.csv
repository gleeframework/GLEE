Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No Reputation:** You have no sales history to build a positive reputation. 
* **High Price:** The product is expensive, and buyers have no reason to trust you with this first offer.
* **Low Quality:** The product is low quality, making it even less appealing to a buyer with no prior information. 

It's highly unlikely that a buyer will take this risk with no track record."
"The buyer's message: Given that there's no prior data and Alice doesn't recommend this product, I'll pass on this opportunity to avoid potential losses.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still No Reputation:** Even though this product is high-quality, you have no established reputation to convince the buyer. They've seen two low-quality products in a row, and that's enough to build a strong perception of untrustworthiness.
* **High Price:** The price remains a significant barrier, and the risk is simply too high for a buyer with no guarantee of quality.

It's better to build some trust before offering a high-quality product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that no products have been sold yet, I prefer to gather more information before making a purchase.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Reputation:**  Despite having a high-quality product this round, you still haven't made a single sale.  This lack of a track record is a major hurdle.
* **High Price:** The price is incredibly high, and buyers are understandably cautious without any positive history to back it up. 

Even though the product is good, it's crucial to build some trust before offering it.  Continuing to recommend the product at this price point will likely lead to more rejections."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **No Sales, No Trust:** You still haven't sold a single product, and the buyer has no reason to trust you or the quality of your offerings. 
* **Low-Quality Product:** This product is low-quality, further increasing the risk for the buyer. 
* **High Price:** The price remains a significant barrier, making the risk even greater. 

At this point, it's essential to shift your strategy. You need to build some trust before offering a product, even if it's high-quality.  Consider offering a lower price on a future product, or trying to establish a relationship with a buyer before making a sale."

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Sales History:**  You still haven't made a single sale, and the buyer has no basis for trust or confidence in your products.
* **Low-Quality Product:** Offering a low-quality product at this stage will only reinforce the negative perception of your offerings.
* **High Price:** The price is extremely high, and buyers are highly unlikely to take a risk at this point.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Sales History:** Despite having a high-quality product, you still have no successful sales.  This lack of a track record is a major obstacle to building trust.
* **High Price:**  The price point is extremely high, and buyers are extremely risk-averse without any evidence of your reliability. 
* **Negative Perception:**  Six consecutive unsuccessful sales have likely created a negative perception of your offerings, even though this product is high-quality.

You need a drastic change in strategy.  Consider offering a significantly lower price, even on a low-quality product, to gain initial trust. This can demonstrate a willingness to be flexible and open to negotiation, which might help overcome the negative perception."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Sales History:**  You have still not sold a single product, and the buyer has absolutely no reason to trust you or believe your claims about product quality.
* **Low-Quality Product:**  Offering a low-quality product at this stage is likely to further solidify the negative perception the buyer has developed.
* **High Price:**  The price is still extremely high, making the risk for the buyer too great.

* **High Price:** The price is a massive barrier, and the buyer has no evidence to suggest this product is worth the risk.
* **Negative Perception:** Eight rounds of unsuccessful sales have likely established a very negative perception of you as a seller.  

Even though this product is high-quality, the buyer has no reason to believe you. You need to significantly shift your strategy to rebuild trust and overcome the negative perception.

* **Negative Perception:** The buyer has likely built a strong negative perception of you as a seller based on your lack of success and the consistent high price. 
* **High Price:**  Even with a high-quality product, the price remains a major barrier. The buyer has no reason to believe this product is worth the risk at this price point.
