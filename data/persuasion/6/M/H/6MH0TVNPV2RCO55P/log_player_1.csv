Would you like to take a chance and own this product with the potential for a quick profit?""}"

I'll give you a 'get out of jail free' card - if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked. That means you'll only lose the time it takes to think about it, and you'll be back to square one. But if it's high-quality, you'll get to keep it and potentially benefit from its value. What do you say? Will you take a chance and own this product, with the safety net of a full refund if it's low-quality?""}"
"Bob's message: While the refund offer is tempting, I'm still not willing to pay $1000000 for a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. The potential upside isn't worth the risk of losing $1000000.
