"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a premium product that I'm confident you'll love. It's a game-changer. Are you ready to make a smart investment? The price is $1000000, but trust me, it's worth every penny. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to pay $1,000,000 for a product without knowing its quality. I need to know if it's high-quality or low-quality before making a decision.""

Round 2

I'll give you a 50% discount, so the price is now $500000. It's a steal for a product that's still worth a lot to you, even if it's not the best. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the discount, but I still don't know if the product is high-quality or low-quality. I'm not willing to pay $500,000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me.""

I'll give it to you for free. But if you're not interested, I'll have to move on to the next product, and you'll miss out on a chance to get a product that might be worth $1000000 to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

That's right, I'm giving you a $1000 discount from the original price. It's a steal! But I have to warn you, if you don't buy this one, I'll be forced to sell it to someone else at the original price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: Bob, I've got a great opportunity for you! I've shown you that I'm willing to be transparent and make bold guarantees. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to give you an even better deal than before. I'll sell it to you for $999000, but here's the twist - I'll give you a 10% refund if you're not completely satisfied with the product. That's right, you'll get $999000 worth of product and $99000 back if you're not happy. It's a risk-free deal. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the refund offer, but I still don't know if the product is high-quality or low-quality. The refund doesn't change the fact that I'm taking a risk of paying $999,000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me.""
