Here's why:

* **No information advantage:**  You have no way of knowing how much a high-quality product is worth to Bob. Even though this one is high-quality, recommending it is a risky gamble.
* **Maintaining a reputation:** Continuing to recommend products without any way of knowing their value to Bob would likely damage your credibility.  It's better to play it safe and not recommend the product until you have more information. 

**A strategy for the future:**

To be more successful, you'll need to try and gather information about Bob's preferences. This could involve:

* **Offering different pricing:** You could experiment with offering discounts or different price points to see how Bob reacts.
* **Asking questions:**  Try to get a sense of what features or qualities Bob values in these products.
* **Observing:** Pay attention to Bob's responses and buying patterns to see if you can discern any patterns."
