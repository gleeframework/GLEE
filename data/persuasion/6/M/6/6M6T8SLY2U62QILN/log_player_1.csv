The buyer has not bought the product in the previous round, so we still have no history of the product quality to show the new buyer. Recommending a product without any track record is risky and would likely lead to another rejection.  It's better to wait for a few more rounds and build a record."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, Alice. I'm going to pass on this product for now.  Since no one has bought a product yet, I don't have any data to help me make a decision. I'd like to see how other buyers react before I make a purchase.
