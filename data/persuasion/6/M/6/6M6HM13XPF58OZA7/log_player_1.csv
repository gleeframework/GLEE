As Alice, you have no way of knowing how much Bob values a high-quality product. Even if it's high-quality, you have been recommending against buying for 7 rounds. It's not credible to suddenly switch to recommending the product without any explanation. Bob might find this suspicious, and there's no guarantee the high-quality product is worth $1 million to him."
