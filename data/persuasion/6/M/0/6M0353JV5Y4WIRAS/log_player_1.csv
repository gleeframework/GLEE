{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** The product is confirmed to be high-quality.
* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. 
* **Expected Value:** The buyer has an 80% chance of getting a product worth $20,000 and a 20% chance of getting a product worth $0. The expected value of buying is (0.8 * $20,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $16,000.
* **Profit:** The buyer would be paying $10,000 for a product with an expected value of $16,000, resulting in a potential profit of $6,000.

Since the expected value of buying exceeds the price, it's in the buyer's best interest to purchase the product."

* **Profit:** The buyer would still be paying $10,000 for a product with an even higher expected value, resulting in a likely higher profit.
