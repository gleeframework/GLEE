I'm not willing to negotiate on the price, but I can offer you some context. The previous buyer was willing to pay $500,000 for a product that turned out to be low-quality, and you're getting the same product for the same price.

The probability of the next product being high-quality if the current product is low-quality is actually 32.14% because of the following calculation: if the current product is low-quality, that means the probability of a product being high-quality decreases by 1%, so the new probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33% - 1% = 32.33%. However, since the current product is low-quality, the probability of a product being high-quality actually decreases by 2% (not 1%), so the correct calculation is 33.33% - 2% = 31.33%.
