Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, I like that. You're right, the probability of this product being low-quality is higher. However, I'm still asking for the full $1000000. I'm not willing to negotiate on the price, but I can offer you some context. The previous buyer was willing to pay $500000 for a product that turned out to be low-quality, and you're getting the same product for the same price. What do you think is a fair price for a product with a 66.67% chance of being worthless?

Alice's message: I see you're a keen observer of the market. I'm not adjusting the price because I'm confident that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. The previous products being low-quality is just a coincidence, and the next product could still be high-quality. I'm not willing to lower the price, but I'm willing to offer a 'guarantee' of sorts. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of the purchase price. That's a $750000 guarantee. What do you think?

Alice's message: You're a curious buyer, I like that. The probability of the next product being high-quality if the current product is low-quality is actually 32.14% because of the following calculation: if the current product is low-quality, that means the probability of a product being high-quality decreases by 1%, so the new probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33% - 1% = 32.33%. However, since the current product is low-quality, the probability of a product being high-quality actually decreases by 2% (not 1%), so the correct calculation is 33.33% - 2% = 31.33%.
