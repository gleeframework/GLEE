,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product. Is it because the previous buyers didn't find it valuable, or is there some other reason?"

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 3 buyers have not purchased high-quality products and the recommendation from Alice is likely influenced by the fact that she knows the true quality of the products. I'd like to see more data or a different recommendation before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's recommendation is no, and I'm trying to exploit the information that all previous buyers have passed on the product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%"

,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low sales of high-quality products so far. It seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is still quite high, and I'm willing to bet on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high quality, I'm inclined to believe that the current product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
