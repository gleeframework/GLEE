Round 2

You'll get your $1000000 back, and we'll forget this ever happened. But if it's high-quality, you'll get to keep it and the discount from the last product. It's a risk-free opportunity to try again. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in your bet. I'm not going to give you the opportunity to take a risk-free shot at selling me a potentially worthless product. I'll pass on this one.""}"
