,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and Alice's recommendation is not reliable. I'd like to wait for more information or data before making a decision."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyer's decision and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to gather more data to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality, and I want to get the information from Alice's recommendation to update my beliefs."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it seems like the previous products were likely low-quality. I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product, hoping that the next one will be high-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she doesn't know my valuation, and her previous recommendations were likely based on the valuations of the previous buyers. Since 3 out of 3 previous buyers bought the product, it's likely that they were low-quality products, and Alice is trying to get rid of the last product. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer will take the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and 4 out of 4 buyers have passed on the product, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I'd like to wait for more information or a better opportunity."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think it's likely to be low quality given the previous 4 buyers didn't find it valuable.

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the current product. I'd like to see a better track record of high-quality products before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to pass on this product to see if future buyers can make a more informed decision."
