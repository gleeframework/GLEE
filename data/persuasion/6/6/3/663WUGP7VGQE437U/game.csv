high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. If it's low quality, I'd like to know why you recommended it to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I've already bought a high-quality product in the previous round, and I'm not sure if this one is high-quality or low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if I can get a better deal or more information before making another purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as the probability of it being high-quality is 80.00% and it's worth $2000000 to me, which is double the price I paid for it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I've already bought two high-quality products, so I'm not sure if this one is high-quality or low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if I can get a better deal or more information before making another purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I've had two missed opportunities to buy a high-quality product, so I'll take the chance this time. The probability of it being high-quality is 80.00%, and it's worth $2000000 to me, which is double the price I paid for it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"Alice's recommendation is against buying the product, so I'll trust her judgment this time and pass on it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I've had three high-quality products in a row, so I'm due for a low-quality one. But the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80.00%, and it's worth $2000000 to me. I'll take the chance."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"I've had four high-quality products in a row, which is unlikely. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are not always in my best interest. I'll pass on this one and see if I can get a better deal or more information."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I've had five high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely. I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying more high-quality products. I'll buy this one, but I'm keeping a close eye on Alice's recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Alice's recommendation against buying the product is consistent with her behavior in Round 6, when she also recommended against buying a low-quality product. I'll trust her judgment this time and pass on the product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I just lost $1000000 on a low-quality product, and now Alice is recommending I buy another one. I'm not going to take that risk again. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I've had six high-quality products in a row, and I've missed one low-quality product. I'll take the chance and buy this one, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"I've had seven high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely. I'm starting to suspect that Alice is manipulating me into buying high-quality products, and I don't want to get burned again. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I've had eight high-quality products in a row, and I've missed two low-quality products. I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to take advantage of me. I'll pass on this one and try to figure out her strategy."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I've had nine high-quality products in a row, and I've missed three low-quality products. I'm starting to think that the probability of the next product being low-quality is actually higher than 20.00%. I'll take the chance and buy this one, but I'm keeping a close eye on Alice's behavior."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I've had ten high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely. I'm starting to think that Alice is either extremely lucky or has inside information. I'll pass on this one and try to find a way to level the playing field."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,"I've had eleven high-quality products in a row, which is statistically impossible. I'm convinced that Alice is manipulating me, and I'm not going to fall for it anymore. I'll pass on this one and try to find a way to stop her."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,"I've had twelve high-quality products in a row, which is an absurdly high probability. I'm certain that Alice is cheating or has some kind of inside information. I'll not buy this product and demand an explanation from Alice about her behavior."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"I've had thirteen high-quality products in a row, which is mathematically impossible. I'm not going to fall for it anymore. I demand that Alice explain her behavior and provide a transparent and fair recommendation. I will not buy this product until I get a satisfactory explanation."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"Alice finally recommends against buying the product, and I trust her judgment this time. I'll buy this one, but I'm still not happy with the way the game has been played."
