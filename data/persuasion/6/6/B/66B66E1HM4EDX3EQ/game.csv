low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I've already lost one low-quality product, and the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%. I'll take the chance and buy this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I've had two low-quality products in a row, so the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 50%. I'll take the chance and buy this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"Alice has recommended two products and both of them were low-quality. I'm going to assume her recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I've seen a pattern where Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, but sometimes she gets lucky and recommends a high-quality product. I'll pass on this one, as the risk of it being low-quality is still too high."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"Two high-quality products in a row that Alice recommended, but I'm still not convinced. I'll wait for her to recommend a low-quality product to confirm my suspicions."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"Three high-quality products in a row that Alice recommended, but I'm still not going to fall for it. I think she's just getting lucky, and I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I've seen a low-quality product that Alice didn't recommend, and I've also seen high-quality products that she recommended. I'll take a chance and buy this one, since she's not recommending it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"After buying two low-quality products, one of which Alice didn't recommend, and now she's recommending this one, I'm going to assume it's low-quality and pass on it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"I've seen a pattern where Alice recommends high-quality products occasionally, but I've also seen her recommend low-quality products more often. I'll pass on this one, since I don't have enough information to trust her recommendation."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"Alice has recommended three high-quality products in a row, but I'm still not going to fall for it. I'll wait for her to recommend a low-quality product to confirm my suspicions."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Alice has recommended three high-quality products and not recommended two low-quality products, so I'll take a chance and buy this one, since she's not recommending it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"I've been burned twice by Alice's recommendations, and now she's recommending another product. I'll pass on this one, since I don't want to risk losing another $1000000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"Alice has recommended four high-quality products and I've seen her recommend low-quality products when she doesn't recommend. I'm starting to think her recommendations are not reliable, so I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I've seen a pattern where Alice's recommendations are not reliable, but she's not recommending this one. I'll take a chance and buy it, since the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,"I've been burned again by Alice's recommendation. I'm starting to think that when she recommends a product, it's likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"Alice has recommended five high-quality products and I've seen her recommend low-quality products when she doesn't recommend. I'm going to stick with my assumption that her recommendations are not reliable, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,no,"It's the final round and I've seen a consistent pattern where Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'll stick to my strategy of passing on her recommended products and waiting for her to not recommend one, which is more likely to be low-quality."
