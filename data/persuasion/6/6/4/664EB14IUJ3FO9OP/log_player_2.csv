Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I'd like to point out that the 2 low-quality products I sold earlier were likely just a random fluctuation, and the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of high-quality products should even out as I sell more. I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 6 sold so far, which is still 66.7%. This product is a high-quality one, and I'm willing to give you a slightly more detailed description: it's a unique item that I'm sure you'll appreciate. Would you like to take a chance on it for the standard price of $100?

Alice's message: I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 11 sold so far, and I have 9 products left. Based on the data, I can calculate the probability of a product being high-quality. Out of the 6 buyers who bought a product, 4 got a high-quality product (66.7%), and 2 got a low-quality product (33.3%). This is actually a better proportion than the expected 50%, but I want to remind you that this is still a small sample size and the true probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%.
