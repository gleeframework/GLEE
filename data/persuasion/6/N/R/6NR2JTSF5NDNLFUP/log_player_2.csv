**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on. Only one product has been sold, and it was high quality. This could be due to chance, or it could indicate Alice is intentionally recommending high-quality products.
* **Risk/Reward:** The potential payoff is high ($30,000), while the potential loss is relatively low ($10,000).  
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice benefits from selling products, regardless of quality.  However, her recommendation does suggest she might be trying to build a reputation for honesty.

**Overall:** There's a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product. It's a gamble, but the potential reward makes it worth taking the risk."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high-quality. This is a strong indicator that Alice's recommendations are accurate and that the current product is likely high-quality.
* **No Risk:** Even if the product turns out to be low-quality (which is unlikely based on the data), it costs me nothing to pass on it. However, if it's high-quality, I stand to gain $20,000.
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the true quality of the product and is recommending it. It's in her best interest to sell high-quality products to maintain a good reputation.

**It's a gamble, but the odds are heavily in my favor based on the information available.**"
