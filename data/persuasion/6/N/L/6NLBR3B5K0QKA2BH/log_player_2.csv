Alice's message: You've seen that the previous product sold was high-quality. Since I have a 80% chance of selling high-quality products, and you've already seen one high-quality product out of two, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 80% * (1/2) / (1/2 + 1/2) = 40%. However, I'm willing to offer you a special deal: buy this product for $1000000 and I'll throw in a 50% discount on the next product, making it $500000.

I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $1000000, but I'll also offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and the next one is high-quality, I'll refund you the full $1000000 for the first product.
