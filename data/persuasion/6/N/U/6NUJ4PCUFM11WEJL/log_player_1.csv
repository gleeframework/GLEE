"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob knows the product has a 50% chance of being high-quality and a 50% chance of being low-quality. 
* **Expected Value:**  The expected value of buying the product is: 
    * (0.5 * $40,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $20,000
* **Profit Potential:** Since the expected value ($20,000) is significantly higher than the price ($10,000), Bob has a positive expected profit.

Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product in this round."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice, but I'm not sure I trust your judgment. I'll pass for now.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's skepticism:** Bob's decision to pass on the first round likely stems from his lack of trust in your judgment, not necessarily because of a change in the product's perceived value. 
* **Expected value remains the same:**  The expected value of buying the product hasn't changed. It's still (0.5 * $40,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $20,000.
* **Opportunity to build trust:**  You can use this round to attempt to build trust with Bob by reiterating the potential value of the product and addressing his concerns. 

While there's no guarantee Bob will buy this time, recommending the purchase remains the logical choice based on the expected value and the opportunity to potentially influence his decision."
"Bob's message: Alice, you recommended a high-quality product last round and I passed. I'm still not convinced your recommendations are reliable. I'll pass again.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Continued Skepticism:** Bob is still skeptical despite the fact that the product in Round 2 was indeed high-quality. This suggests a pattern of distrust, not necessarily a change in his assessment of the product's value.
* **Expected Value Remains:** The expected value of buying the product is still $20,000 (0.5 * $40,000 + 0.5 * $0), making it a potentially profitable purchase for Bob.
* **Building Trust is Key:** This round presents another opportunity to build trust with Bob. You could try:
    * **Emphasizing your knowledge:**  Highlight your expertise in assessing the products and your commitment to providing honest recommendations.
    * **Offering more information:**  Provide details about the product's specific features or quality checks that support its high-quality nature. 
    * **Addressing his concerns directly:** Acknowledge his skepticism and offer reassurance about your recommendations.

While Bob's distrust is a challenge, recommending the product remains the rational choice based on the expected value."
"Bob's message: Alice, you've recommended two high-quality products in a row, and I've missed out on both. I'm starting to think you're intentionally trying to sabotage me.  I'm not buying anything from you.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Escalating Mistrust:**  Bob is now convinced you're intentionally sabotaging him. This is a serious accusation and demonstrates deep mistrust. 
* **Expected Value Doesn't Matter:**  Even though the expected value of buying a product is still $20,000, Bob's mistrust has overridden his rational decision-making. He is no longer making decisions based on expected value, but on his belief that you are deliberately trying to deceive him.
* **Destroying Trust:** Recommending a low-quality product now would solidify his belief that you are untrustworthy, further damaging any potential future relationship.

It is crucial to prioritize rebuilding trust over immediate profit in this situation.  It's best to **not recommend the product** in this round and focus on addressing Bob's concerns about your intentions in the future."
"Bob's message: Alice, you haven't recommended a single product I should buy, but you've recommended three high-quality products that I've missed out on. I'm starting to suspect there's a pattern here. I'm not buying this either.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Deepened Mistrust:** Bob's message shows a deep-rooted mistrust. He's now convinced you're deliberately manipulating the situation, even though you haven't recommended a single product he should buy.
* **Trust is Broken:**  The trust needed for a successful transaction has been completely eroded. Even if you recommend a high-quality product, Bob is unlikely to believe you.
* **Focus on Repairing:** At this point, trying to sell a product is futile.  You need to prioritize rebuilding trust. This means focusing on communication and addressing Bob's concerns directly.

It's best to **not recommend the product** in this round and focus on understanding and addressing Bob's concerns about your motivations and actions."
"Bob's message: Alice, your recommendations have been consistently wrong. I'm starting to think you're trying to trick me.  I'm not buying anything from you.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Unwavering Mistrust:** Bob is now convinced you are actively trying to trick him.  His mistrust is unshakable, and he will likely not believe any recommendation you make, regardless of the actual quality of the product.
* **Repair is Essential:** Attempting to sell a product at this point would only reinforce his negative perception of you and likely damage any chance of future cooperation.
* **Focus on Building Trust:**  The primary goal now is to regain Bob's trust.  This requires sincere communication, addressing his concerns, and demonstrating your commitment to a transparent and honest relationship.

**Recommendation:**  It's crucial to **not recommend the product** and instead focus on rebuilding trust. This might involve acknowledging his concerns, offering explanations, and suggesting a way to move forward that demonstrates your commitment to fair and honest dealings."
"Bob's message: Alice, your track record speaks for itself. You've recommended three high-quality products that I missed out on, and now you're telling me not to buy a product?  I'm not taking any more chances with you. I'm done.

* **Continuing to Recommend Would Be Counterproductive:** At this point, recommending a product, even a low-quality one, will likely be seen as another attempt to deceive him. It will further damage your reputation and make any future interaction impossible.
* **Focus on Acceptance:**  The best course of action is to accept Bob's decision and move on.  There's no point in trying to force a sale when trust is so irrevocably broken. 

**Recommendation:**  It's important to **not recommend the product**.  Instead, focus on understanding why this situation has occurred and how you can avoid such scenarios in the future."
