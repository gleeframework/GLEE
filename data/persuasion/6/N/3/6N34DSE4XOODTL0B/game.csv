The statistics are looking good, but I know that's not a guarantee for the next product. I'm willing to share this information with you because I'm confident in the quality of this product.

This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident it will make a significant difference in your experience with the product. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to clarify that the premium service package is a one-time offer. Can you tell me more about the product itself and its features, and how it compares to the previous three products that were sold?",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're interested in the product! As I mentioned earlier, this product is high-quality, and it has received rave reviews. Compared to the previous three products, this one has some unique features that set it apart. For example, it has a more advanced algorithm that allows for even better performance and efficiency. Additionally, it comes with a more comprehensive user manual and tutorial, making it easier for new users to get started.

However, I'd like to remind you that every product is unique, and there's always a chance that the next one might not be high-quality. With that said, I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the price is non-negotiable, and I'm not willing to offer any discounts. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned that the high proportion of high-quality products sold so far might be due to chance. I'd like to know if you have any data on the long-term proportion of high-quality products sold, or if you have any insights on how the quality of the products might be distributed.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to think critically about the data. Unfortunately, I don't have any long-term data on the proportion of high-quality products sold, as this is the first batch of products I've sold. However, I can tell you that the quality of the products is determined by a complex process that involves multiple factors, including the manufacturing process, quality control measures, and random chance. While I can't guarantee the quality of every product, I can assure you that I've taken every precaution to ensure that each product meets the highest standards. With that said, I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000. I'm confident that you'll be satisfied with your purchase, and I'm willing to stand behind the quality of this product. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to propose a small adjustment to the price.

If you're willing to pay the full price, I'm willing to sell it to you. If not, I'll have to decline your offer. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not willing to pay the full price without knowing the product's quality. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. If I were to buy it, I'd like to know the product's quality after my decision, please.",no
