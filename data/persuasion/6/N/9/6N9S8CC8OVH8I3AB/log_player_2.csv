**Reasoning:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which is a strong signal. 
* **Limited data:** While only one product has been sold before, it was high quality. This is a positive sign, though not conclusive.
* **Expected Value:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0). This means the expected value of buying is positive, even with the higher chance of a low-quality product.

**Important Note:** This decision is based on limited information. There's a significant risk of buying a low-quality product. However, given the information available and the recommendation from Alice, buying is the more logical choice in this situation."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This suggests Alice's recommendations are likely reliable.
* **Potential Value:** Even with the inherent risk, the potential gain of $20 (value of high-quality product minus the price) outweighs the risk of losing $100.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying, further increasing confidence in the product's quality.

**Overall:**  The information available suggests a favorable risk/reward scenario. It's worth taking a chance on the product."
