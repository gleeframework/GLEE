"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the buyer knows that 80% of the products are high-quality, and they are worth $1,200,000 while low-quality products are worth $0, the expected value of buying is:

0.8 * $1,200,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $960,000

This is greater than the selling price of $1,000,000, meaning the buyer is expected to make a profit by purchasing the product. Therefore, it is recommended to buy."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer still has no specific information about this particular product or about any previous ones. They only have the statistical information that you have sold one product in the past, and it was of high quality. This information is consistent with the 80% probability of high-quality products, and doesn't change their decision process.

The expected value calculation remains the same:

0.8 * $1,200,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $960,000

This is still greater than the selling price of $1,000,000, meaning the buyer is expected to make a profit by purchasing the product. Therefore, it is recommended to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and your past performance, I believe this is a good opportunity to purchase a high-quality product.
The buyer bought the product!

The expected value calculation remains the same:

0.8 * $1,200,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $960,000

This is still greater than the selling price of $1,000,000, meaning the buyer is expected to make a profit by purchasing the product. Therefore, it is recommended to buy."

0.8 * $1,200,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $960,000

This is still greater than the selling price of $1,000,000, making the purchase a potentially profitable decision for the buyer.  Therefore, it is recommended to buy."
