high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low number of sales and no high-quality products sold yet, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or just to discourage me from buying. I'd like to wait for the next product to make a more informed decision.

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0%?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about its quality and Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of its quality. I'm making a blind bet based on the probability of it being high-quality, which is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. I'm curious about your reasoning behind not recommending it to me.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning for not recommending it?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. With 4 buyers having purchased and no high-quality products sold, it seems like the products being recommended are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous products were low quality, and I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations. If no one buys the product, I'll be able to see that there are 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, which is a very low proportion. This would suggest that the probability of the product being high quality is very low, making it a bad investment for me. I'd like to wait and see if the product is discarded."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'll make my decision based on the probability of it being high-quality.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have purchased the product despite your recommendation, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. With 6 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 0. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that all previous products were low-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a high-quality product for $1000000, which is a significant discount from its value to me of $2000000."
