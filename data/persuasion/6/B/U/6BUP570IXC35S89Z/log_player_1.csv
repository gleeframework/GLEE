I've sold 1 product so far, and it was a low-quality one. This product, on the other hand, is of high quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a price that's still relatively low considering the odds. What do you think?""

Given the odds, this product has a 50% chance of being high-quality as well. However, I want to offer you a unique insight: the first buyer was willing to pay $1,000,000 for the low-quality product, and now you have the opportunity to buy a potentially high-quality product for the same price. This is a chance to potentially double your return on investment. What do you think?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000 for it. I'm taking a risk that it might be low-quality, but the potential reward is too great to pass up. I'm hoping you'll consider my offer.

However, the last buyer was willing to pay only $500,000 for the high-quality product, which suggests that they're not willing to pay the full price of $1,000,000 for a high-quality product. This might indicate that the high-quality products aren't as valuable as the low-quality ones. I'm offering this low-quality product to you for $1,000,000. Would you like to take a chance on it?""

Keep in mind that the odds are still 50/50, and you might be getting a great deal. What do you think?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'm not sure I want to take the risk of paying $1000000 for a low-quality product, especially given the information that the previous buyer who paid the full price got a low-quality product.

I can confirm that the $500,000 sale was indeed for a high-quality product. However, I'm now offering you a low-quality product for $1,000,000.
