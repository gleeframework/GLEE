But what's the probability of the next product being low-quality? Would it be 46.7%?

Alice's message: I'm impressed by your math skills! Yes, the probability of the next product being low-quality is indeed 46.7% (7 low-quality out of 15 total products). To calculate the expected value, let's assume the high-quality product is worth $X and the low-quality product is worth $0 (since it's not worth anything). The expected value is then (0.533 * X + 0.467 * 0) = 0.533X. Since you're not willing to pay more than $9500, I'll assume that's the maximum value you're willing to pay for a high-quality product. Let's set up the equation: 0.533X = 9500. Solving for X, we get X = 17800. This means that the expected value of the product is $9500, which is equal to the price I'm offering. I'm selling this product to you for the original price of $10000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price. What do you think?
