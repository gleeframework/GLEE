low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Since 3 out of 3 products have been low-quality, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might also be low-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 3 products were high-quality, I think the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the products after Alice's recommendations, I'm inclined to believe that the products Alice recommends are likely low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered, hoping that it might be a high-quality one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 products sold so far have been low quality, I think it's likely that the product is also low quality, and I don't want to waste $10000 on something worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm curious about the underlying reasoning behind your recommendation, though. Is it based on the product's quality or the overall sales trend?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I'm not getting a recommendation to buy, and I want to see if I can get a high-quality product despite the low odds. I'm doing this to test Alice's strategy and to see if I can beat the odds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given the previous 5 buyers have all passed on the products."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, it suggests that they were low-quality products. I'll take a chance and pass on this one too."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations, it seems that all products sold so far have been low-quality. Given the high probability of a low-quality product (66.67%), I'm inclined to believe that the current product is also low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and avoid the potential loss of $10000."
