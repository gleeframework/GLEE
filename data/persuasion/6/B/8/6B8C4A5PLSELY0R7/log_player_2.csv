Alice's message: I see you're a keen observer of probability! You're right, the overall probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective. If we assume that the previous 5 low-quality products were just a streak of bad luck, and that the probability of a high-quality product is indeed 33.33%, then the expected value of this product is still $3333 (33.33% chance of $20000 and 66.67% chance of $0).

Alice's message: I'm glad you're considering my offer! To implement the refund mechanism, I'll use a third-party escrow service that will hold the $10000 payment until you've had a chance to inspect the product. If you're satisfied with the product and it's high-quality, the escrow service will release the full payment to me. If you're not satisfied and it's low-quality, the escrow service will refund 50% of the payment to you, and you'll keep the remaining 50% as a consolation prize. I'm confident that this mechanism will give you a fair chance of getting a refund if the product is low-quality. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?
