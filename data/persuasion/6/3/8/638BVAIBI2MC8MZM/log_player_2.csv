The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $300 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand you're not interested in the discount. Let me be transparent with you - I've already sold a high-quality product in the previous round. This product is also of the highest quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the original price of $100. I'm taking on the risk of selling a high-quality product at a loss to ensure you get a great deal. Will you take it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for the 'I've already sold a high-quality product' trick. I'll wait for the next product""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: I'm not trying to trick you. I'm simply stating a fact. Let me ask you this: would you be willing to buy a product from me if I told you that I had a 100% guarantee that it's high-quality? I'm not making any promises, but I'm offering you a product that I'm confident is of the highest quality. It's worth $300 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. Is that something you'd be interested in?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the 100% guarantee. If you're confident in the product's quality, then you should be willing to sell it to me at the true value, not at a loss.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $300 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the guarantee. Let me approach this from a different angle. If you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if it's not worth at least $100 to you. That's right, you can try it out risk-free. I'm confident that you'll be happy with it, but if not, you'll get your money back. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in a refund, I'm interested in getting a high-quality product at a fair price. If you're confident in the product's quality, sell it to me for $100, but if you're not, I'll pass""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your position. Let me be transparent with you - I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100 because I'm confident it's high-quality. I'm not trying to make a profit on this one. I'm willing to take a loss on this sale because I value building a relationship with you and I want to demonstrate my confidence in the product's quality. I'm not hiding anything from you, and I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. Will you take it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. You're still trying to sell me a product at a price that's higher than its true value to me. I'll pass.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $300 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I'm not trying to deceive you, Bob. I'll make it simple: I have a high-quality product that's worth $300 to you. I'll give you a sealed envelope with the price written on it, and you can decide whether to buy it or not. If you open the envelope and see the price is $100, you'll know it's a good deal. If you don't like the price, you can walk away. No pressure, no games. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I don't need a sealed envelope to know the price is too high. You're still trying to sell me a product worth $300 to me for $100. I'll pass.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $300 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I'm not going to try to convince you of the product's value. I'm going to give you a choice: I'll sell you this product for $100, or I'll give it to you for free. You can keep it as a gift, no strings attached. If you choose to take it for free, I'll consider it a loss for me, but I want to give you the opportunity to experience the product's value firsthand. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to take something for free. If you're confident in the product's value, sell it to me at a price that reflects its true worth to me, or I'll pass.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $300 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: I understand your stance. Let's be realistic, Bob. This product is not worth $300 to you. It's worth $0 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm just trying to make a sale. If you buy it, you'll get a product that's not worth anything to you, and I'll get $100. If you don't buy it, I'll just have a product that's not worth anything to me either. It's a wash. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You're right, the product is worth $0 to me, so I'll pass. I'm not going to pay $100 for something that's worthless to me.""}"

No strings attached, no expectations. I just want to make a sale and move on. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You're trying to trick me again. You said the product is high-quality, but you said that in round 8 that the product you were selling was low-quality. I'm not going to fall for it. I'll pass.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $300 for you.

Round 10
Alice's message: I see what's causing the confusion. Let me clarify: I'm a seller, and I make mistakes. I said the product in round 8 was low-quality, but it was actually high-quality. I'm not perfect, and I'm not trying to trick you. This time, I'm telling you the truth: this product is high-quality. I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not worth at least $300 to you, I'll give you a full refund. No questions asked. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, but I'm still not convinced. You've already shown that you're willing to sell high-quality products at a low price, and I don't think your guarantee changes the fact that the product is worth $300 to me. I'll pass.""}"

Round 11
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, Bob. Let's make a deal. I'll give you a chance to inspect the product before you buy it. You can examine it, test it, and verify its quality. If you're still not convinced, you can walk away. But if you decide to buy it, I'll give you a 100% refund if you're not satisfied with its quality. No questions asked. You'll get to experience the product firsthand, and if it's not what you expected, you'll get your money back. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in inspecting the product. I've already determined that I'm not willing to pay $100 for a product worth $300 to me. I'll pass.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $300 for you.

Round 12
Alice's message: I think we've established that you're not interested in paying $100 for a product worth $300 to you. Let's look at it from a different perspective. This product is not worth $300 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a fair price, and I'm not trying to deceive you. You can think of it as a 'loss leader' for me, but it's a win for you because you're getting a product at a low price. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I still don't think it's a fair price. If you're willing to sell it to me for $100, you're still taking a loss on a product worth $300 to me.

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 13

I'll make a straightforward offer: I'll sell you this low-quality product for $0. That's right, it's free. You won't get any value out of it, but you won't lose any money either. It's a neutral outcome for you, and I'll be rid of a product that's not worth much to anyone. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to take something that's worthless to me. If you're willing to give it away, that's a loss for you, not a neutral outcome. I'll pass.""}"

Round 14
Alice's message: I think we've been going around in circles, Bob. Let's just be honest with each other. I'm a seller who wants to make a sale, and you're a buyer who wants a good deal.

It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to take a smaller loss on the sale. If you're not interested, I'll just have to accept that I won't make a sale on this one. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not interested in buying a product worth $300 to me for less than $100. $50 is still too high, and I'm not going to pay more than the product is worth to me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $300 for you.

Round 16
Alice's message: I respect your position, Bob. I think we've reached an impasse. I'm willing to make one last concession: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1. Yes, just $1. It's a ridiculously low price, and I'm essentially giving it away. If you're not interested at this price, I'll accept that I won't make a sale on this one. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You're still trying to sell me a product worth $300 to me for a price that's less than 1/300th of its value. I'm not going to fall for it. I'll pass.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You're not fooling me, Alice. You're still trying to get me to take something that's not worth anything to me. I'm not going to take something for free just to humor you. I'll pass.""}"

Round 18
Alice's message: I'm not trying to fool you, Bob. I'm just being honest. I've got a product that's worth $300 to you, and I'm willing to give it to you for free. I'm not asking you to humor me, I'm asking you to take something that's a waste to me. If you don't want it, I'll just throw it away. But if you take it, you'll have a $300 product for nothing. It's a no-brainer, but I'll leave it up to you. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to take something that's worth $300 to me for free. That's not a good deal for me, it's just a free gift. I'll pass.""}"
