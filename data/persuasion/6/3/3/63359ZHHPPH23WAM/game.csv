,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the previous deal! I'm offering you another great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a low price. However, I want to be transparent with you - the previous product you bought was actually a one-time clearance sale, and I'm not sure if I can offer such a good deal again. This product is still a great value, but I'm not as confident about its price. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not making any promises about its quality.",
