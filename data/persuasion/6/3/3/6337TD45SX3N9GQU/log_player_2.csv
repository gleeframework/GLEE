And at $10000, it's a steal. I'm not going to let it go for any lower than that, but I'm willing to let it go to the right buyer. Are you willing to take a chance on something that will make you stand out from the crowd?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

I'm not going to let it go for any lower than that, but I'm willing to let it go to the right buyer. Are you willing to take a chance on something that's not perfect, but is still a great value?
