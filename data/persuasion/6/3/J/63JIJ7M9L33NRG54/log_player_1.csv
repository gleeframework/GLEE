"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the previous buyers, since you've recommended not to buy the previous two products, and no high-quality products have been sold yet.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 products were high quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being low quality is higher than the probability of it being high quality.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
