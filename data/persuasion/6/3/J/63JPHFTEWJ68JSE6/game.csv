low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance, since there's no information to go on yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the lack of information from the first buyer. I'm hoping that the product is high quality, but I'm aware that the probability is against me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm trying to break the streak of no high-quality products sold, not because I think the product is high-quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and prove to you that the probability of high-quality products is higher than 33.33%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the products being sold are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for another opportunity to buy."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 buyers have already passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's low quality so you'll have a better chance of selling it to the next buyer."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I would like to pass on this product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious about the probability of a high-quality product given the previous sales record. Could you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 purchases, which suggests a very low probability of a high-quality product. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to risk wasting my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that the previous 5 buyers didn't find it worth it, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'll buy it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 6 buyers having purchased and no high-quality products sold, it seems the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation not to buy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 buyers have been presented with products and none of them were high-quality, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is lower than the overall probability. I'd like to see the next product before making a decision."
