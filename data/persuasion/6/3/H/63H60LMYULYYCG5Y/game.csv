If you buy two high-quality products in a row, you'll get a total of 20% off the second product. What do you say?",

This one is also high-quality, and if you buy it, you'll get a total of 20% off. However, I want to give you a heads up that if you buy a low-quality product next, the deal is off, and we'll start fresh. But if you buy another high-quality product, I'll throw in an additional 5% discount on top of the 20% you already have. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm confident in the quality and will buy this product, aiming for the extra discount.",yes

However, I want to give you a warning that if you buy a low-quality product next, not only will the deal be off, but I'll also reveal the true probability of a product being high-quality to you.
