,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't have any information about the product's quality. I'm essentially making a random guess. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that the probability of it being low-quality is 50%. I'm not relying on your recommendation, which is neutral in this case, and I'm not influenced by the previous sales record since it's not relevant to my decision. I'm making a decision based on my own risk assessment and the potential reward of getting a high-quality product."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also received the recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than the overall 50%.
