"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product for $10000. I'm confident that this product has the potential to bring you significant value, but I want to be transparent with you. I've had a few products in the past that didn't meet expectations, but this one is different. I'm willing to provide you with a special deal on this first product, and I'm willing to give you a 50% discount if you decide to buy it now. That brings the price down to $5000. What do you say?
