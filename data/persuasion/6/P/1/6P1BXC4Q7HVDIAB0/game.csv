,,Alice,2,no,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both products were low quality, I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation and would like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that 2 previous buyers passed on the products, which might indicate a bias towards low-quality products. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite the odds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, but I'm curious about the seller's previous sales record. Can you tell me more about the 3 buyers who purchased the products?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that none of the previous 3 buyers were able to find a high-quality product, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is low."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the current statistics. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the expected 0.5.

high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the products before me and none of the high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for a product that has been passed on by at least one buyer to see if the seller's recommendation is influenced by the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0, I'm assuming that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them have bought high-quality products. This suggests that the products recommended so far are likely to be low-quality."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
