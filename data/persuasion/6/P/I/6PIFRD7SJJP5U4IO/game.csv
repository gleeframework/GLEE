In fact, I'm willing to offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a $200000 discount on the next product I offer you. That way, you'll essentially get this product for $800000, which is a steal. What do you say?",

I'll sell it to you for $500000, which is a significant discount from the usual price.
