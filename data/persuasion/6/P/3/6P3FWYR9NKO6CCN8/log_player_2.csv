Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your advice, Alice. I will pass on this product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's recommendation is valuable information. Since she does not recommend buying the product, it suggests a higher likelihood of it being low quality. 
* As a rational buyer, it makes sense to prioritize maximizing potential gains and minimizing potential losses. 
* Buying a product with a higher chance of being low quality would result in a $1,000,000 loss. Passing is a safer strategy in this round."

```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's recommendation carries weight. Since she recommends buying this product, it suggests a higher likelihood of it being high quality.
* We know from the previous round that Alice's recommendations are not always accurate, but they provide valuable information.
* Buying a high-quality product would result in a $1,000,000 profit, outweighing the potential risk of it being low quality.
* While there's a risk of losing $1,000,000, the potential reward is significantly higher, making it a worthwhile gamble based on Alice's recommendation."

* We gained a profit of $1,000,000 in the previous round by trusting Alice's recommendation.
* Although there's always the risk of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk, especially considering Alice's track record in the last round."

```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has successfully recommended two high-quality products in a row. This builds a strong pattern of accurate recommendations, making it highly likely that this product is also high-quality.

```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's recommendation pattern has shifted. After three consecutive successful recommendations, she now advises against buying. This change in pattern suggests a higher likelihood of the product being low quality.
* It's crucial to be adaptable and avoid becoming overly reliant on past patterns.
