I've sold 2 out of 3 products so far, which is a 66.67% success rate. This suggests that my products are indeed of high quality. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for the same price of $10000. You're getting a great deal on a high-quality item. What do you say?

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, your statistics are misleading. While you have sold 2 out of 3 products, you haven't provided any information about the quality of those products. We still don't know if the products you sold were high or low quality.  Therefore, I'm not comfortable making a purchase based on this limited information.  Please provide more transparency about the quality of the products you've sold in the past.  I'm willing to reconsider if you can provide more data.""}
