high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'll wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that you recommended it to me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I think it's possible that the previous buyer was just unlucky and got a low-quality product, so I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not convinced based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to know more about the products before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's worthless to me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers have purchased the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that I have no information about the product's quality, and Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'll take the chance to potentially get a high-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics. What's the probability that the product is high-quality, given that you don't recommend it?"

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. I'm thinking that if 3 out of 3 products were low quality, the probability of the current product being high quality is very low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer, and I don't think the fact that you didn't recommend it changes the underlying probability of the product being high or low quality."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far is a bad sign, and I'd like to pass on this one."

,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, which suggests that the product she is offering to me might be low-quality. I would like to pass on this product."
