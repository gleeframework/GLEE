The previous 3 buyers who bought low-quality products were likely influenced by my earlier sales record, which was still building. However, with 6 high-quality products sold out of 19 total, I believe my sales record is starting to reflect the true probability of a product being high-quality. I'm offering you a deal on this high-quality product because I'm confident that it's the real deal. This product is worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.
