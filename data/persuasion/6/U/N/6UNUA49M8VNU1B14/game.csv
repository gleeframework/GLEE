,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the statistics, none of the previous products were high-quality, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, and that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a product with a 50% chance of being low-quality and a 0 value to me."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for a later product to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data, and also the probability of Alice recommending a product if it's high quality."
