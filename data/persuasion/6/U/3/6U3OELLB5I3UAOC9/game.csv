,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision based on the lack of information. I'll buy the product and see what happens."

,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous three buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I suspect that Alice's recommendations may be based on the product's quality. Since I have a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy, but none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.

,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales so far. I think the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this one too. I'll wait for the next one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm skeptical about the recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales? How many products were sold, and what was the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm trying to exploit the information that all previous buyers were discouraged by her recommendations, which suggests that they were all low-quality products."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 6 purchases. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than the 33.33% chance. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have bought the products recommended by you, and none of them were high-quality, I believe you are trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I will pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 6, which is lower than the expected 2. This suggests that the remaining products might be more likely to be low-quality."
