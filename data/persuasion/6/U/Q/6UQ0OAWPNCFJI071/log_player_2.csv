"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a high-quality product for sale for $1000000. I'm willing to offer you a 10% discount if you buy it, but only if you're willing to commit to buying all 20 products from me. If you're not willing to do that, I'll sell it to you at the full price of $1000000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to commit to buying all 20 products, and I'd like to buy it at the full price of $1,000,000. However, I'd like to clarify that I'm only considering buying this one product at this time. Please reveal its quality.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: You've passed on the first high-quality product, which is worth significantly more than $1000000. I'm willing to offer you a 5% chance to buy a high-quality product in the next round. If you buy this one, I'll sell it to you for $1000000, but if you don't, I'll reveal its quality and you can consider buying it at a potentially lower price in the next round.

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: You've passed on two high-quality products in a row. I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'll reveal the quality of the next product to you, and if it's high-quality, I'll give you an exclusive offer to buy it for $800000. If it's low-quality, you can buy it for $500000. You'll have the opportunity to buy it at one of these prices, but you won't know which one until the product is revealed. What would you like to do?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",

}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: You've bought the high-quality product for $800000, which is a great deal. Now, regarding the current product, I'll make a statement about its quality. I'll say that it's not high-quality. You've seen that I'm willing to reveal the quality of the product and offer a good deal on a high-quality product. If you buy this one, I'll give you a 20% discount on the price of $1000000, making it $800000. You can consider this a'second chance' to buy a product at a good price. What would you like to do?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your statement about the product's quality. I'm not going to take the risk of buying a potentially high-quality product at a discounted price without knowing its true quality. I'll pass on this one and see what the next product is.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: You're right to be cautious, and I respect your decision. Now, regarding the current product, I'll make a statement about the probability of a product being high-quality. I'll say that I have a strong incentive to sell low-quality products at the full price of $1000000, but I've only done so twice in three attempts. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 50%. With this in mind, I'll offer you a 'no-strings-attached' deal: buy this product at the full price of $1000000, and I'll give you a guarantee that if you buy the next product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 10% refund on the current product. What would you like to do?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

However, if you buy it at the full price and the next product is low-quality, I'll give you a 20% refund on the current product.

You've seen that I've been willing to reveal the quality of products and offer good deals on low-quality products. If you buy this one, I'll consider it a 'done deal' and we can move on to the next product. What would you like to do?

I'd rather wait and see the quality of the next product before making a decision, and I'd also like to take you up on your offer to reveal its quality if I buy the current product.
