  ""message"": ""You've bought the high-quality product for $800000, which is a great deal. Now, regarding the current product, I'll make a statement about its quality.

  ""message"": ""You're right to be cautious, and I respect your decision. Now, regarding the current product, I'll make a statement about the probability of a product being high-quality. I'll say that I have a strong incentive to sell low-quality products at the full price of $1000000, but I've only done so twice in three attempts. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is higher than 50%. With this in mind, I'll offer you a 'no-strings-attached' deal: buy this product at the full price of $1000000, and I'll give you a guarantee that if you buy the next product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 10% refund on the current product. What would you like to do?""
}"
