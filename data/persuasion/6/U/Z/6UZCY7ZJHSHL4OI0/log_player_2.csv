**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:** Alice has recommended 12 products, and all 12 were high-quality. This suggests she is either extremely lucky or knows the quality of each product. 
* **High Value if High Quality:** The potential gain from buying a high-quality product ($2,000,000) is significantly greater than the loss from buying a low-quality product ($1,000,000). 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice benefits by selling products. If she knows the product is low-quality, she wouldn't recommend it as she wouldn't make a sale.

While there is still a 20% chance the product is low-quality, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests it's high-quality.  The potential reward outweighs the risk."
