**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products.  While this could be due to chance, it's a strong indicator that Alice's recommendations are likely accurate.
* **No Downside:** Even if the product is low quality, it costs you nothing to pass. Since the odds are heavily in favor of a high-quality product, there's little risk in buying.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the decision. 

**Important Note:**  While the statistics are encouraging, remember that they are based on a small sample size. The risk of a low-quality product is still present."
