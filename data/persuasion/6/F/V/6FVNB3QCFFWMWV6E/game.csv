low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've just seen that the previous product was low-quality. I've sold 1 product so far, and 0 of them were high-quality. I'm still offering this product to you for $10000. The probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%. If you're willing to take the risk, you can buy it.",

,,the buyer,5,"I'm interested in the offer, but I'd like to clarify that the 50% discount on the second product is only applicable if I buy the current product and it turns out to be high-quality, correct?
