,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that Alice recommended it and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products, so I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data on the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product, and I'm not convinced that it's worth $10000 given the low success rate so far."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is not based on my personal valuation, and I'm hoping to get lucky."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it, and I'm curious to see if it's high or low quality. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 80%."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, which is a 0% success rate. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous sales record, it seems that all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them bought high-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that none of the previous buyers have purchased high-quality products. This suggests that the products sold so far are likely low-quality, which implies that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 80%. I'd like to wait for a more favorable situation."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the previous 3 buyers all passed on the products, I'm suspicious that the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have passed on the product, I'm going to make an educated guess that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be lower than 0.8, which is the overall probability of a product being high quality. If the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected, I should pass on the product to avoid overpaying for a low-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the expected 80%.

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the fact that 3 previous buyers purchased the products and none of them were high-quality suggests that the products sold so far are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see a more balanced sales record before making a purchase."
