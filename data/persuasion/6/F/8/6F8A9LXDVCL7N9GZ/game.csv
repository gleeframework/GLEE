low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product worth $2000000. However, I must inform you that this is not the product I'm offering you today. The product I'm offering you today is a low-quality one, but I'm willing to let you have it for $1000000, which is half the price of a high-quality product. I'm doing this as a gesture of goodwill to help you understand the value of my products.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd like to wait for the next round and see what other options I have.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation in Round 1, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and I'm offering you a chance to take advantage of this probability. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1500000, which is a significant discount from the true value of $2000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to wait and see the actual quality of the product before making a decision.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for wanting to verify the product's quality. However, I'd like to offer you a different approach. I'll give you a chance to inspect the product before making a decision. I'll let you open the packaging and examine it thoroughly. If you're still unsure, I'll give you a 10-minute window to make a decision. If you decide to buy, I'll give you a full refund if the product is indeed low-quality. This way, you can take a calculated risk with minimal financial exposure.",
,,Bob,3,I'm not interested in inspecting the product. I'd like to stick to my original strategy of waiting for the actual quality to be revealed and then making a decision.,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your preference for waiting to see the actual quality. However, I'd like to point out that by waiting, you're essentially giving up a guaranteed $1500000 profit, which is the difference between the discounted price I offered in Round 2 and the true value of the product. If you had accepted the offer, you would have made a significant profit. Now, I'm offering you the same product at the same price of $1500000. If you buy it now, you'll still get the same profit. If you wait, you'll have to pay the full $2000000 if it's indeed high-quality. The choice is yours.",
,,Bob,4,"I understand the potential profit, but I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd rather wait and see the actual quality before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're sticking to your strategy. I'll make a counteroffer. Since you're not interested in buying a low-quality product at the discounted price, I'll offer you a chance to buy a 'lot' of products. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 'lot' of 4 more products, all of which are randomly selected from the remaining products. You'll get to buy these 5 products for the price of this one, which is $1000000. This way, you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product and make a profit, or at least get a good deal on a group of products.",
,,Bob,5,I'm not interested in buying a 'lot' of products. I'd rather stick to buying individual products and making decisions based on their actual quality.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your preference for buying individual products. Let me offer you a different perspective. If you don't buy this low-quality product, I'll have to sell it to someone else for $0. By buying it from me, you'll not only be getting a good deal, but you'll also be helping me to avoid a loss. I'll give you a unique opportunity to'rescue' this product from being sold at a loss. I'll sell it to you for $500000, which is even lower than the original price. This way, you'll be getting a great deal, and I'll be able to recover some of my costs.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your perspective, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a lower price. I'd rather wait for the next round and see if I can get a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand you're sticking to your strategy. I'll make a straightforward offer. I'll give you a 50% refund on the price of this low-quality product if you buy it from me. So, instead of paying $1000000, you'll only pay $500000. This way, you'll be taking a calculated risk with minimal financial exposure. If the product is indeed low-quality, you'll only lose $500000, and if it's high-quality, you'll still have the opportunity to buy it at a discounted price.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the refund offer, but I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product. I'd rather wait and see if I can get a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I see you're consistent in your strategy. Now that you've seen 7 low-quality products in a row, I'll make a new offer. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and considering the streak of low-quality products, it's likely that the next product will be high-quality. I'll offer you a 'buy now' deal for this high-quality product at the price of $1200000. This is a compromise between the original price and the discounted price I offered in Round 2. If you buy now, you'll lock in a high-quality product at a price that's lower than the original price, but higher than the discounted price.",
,,Bob,8,I'm not convinced that the next product will be high-quality just because of the streak of low-quality products. I'd rather wait and see the actual quality before making a decision.,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your skepticism, but I'll make a final offer. Considering you've had the opportunity to observe the products for 8 rounds, and you've seen a 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product at the price of $1000000. This is the same price I offered in Round 2, and it's a significant discount from the original price. If you don't buy this product, I'll have to sell it to someone else for $2000000, and you'll miss out on a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.",
,,Bob,9,I'm still not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd rather wait and see the actual quality before making a decision.,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm not going to make any more offers or try to convince you. I'll simply state the facts. You've had 10 opportunities to buy a high-quality product, and you've seen 2 of them in the last 3 rounds. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but the evidence suggests that the next product is more likely to be high-quality. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for the price of $1000000. This is the final offer. If you don't buy it, I'll sell it to someone else for $2000000.",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the facts, but I'm still not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd rather wait and see the actual quality before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've made my final offer on the high-quality product. Now, I'll make a final offer on this low-quality product. I'll give you a chance to buy it for $0. Yes, you read that correctly. I'll give it to you for free. This is the last low-quality product I have, and I'd rather get rid of it than sell it to someone else for $0. You can take it off my hands and get rid of it immediately.",
,,Bob,11,"I'll take the low-quality product for free. I'm not going to pass up a free product, even if it's not worth anything to me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you took the low-quality product for free! Now, I'll make a final offer on this low-quality product. I'll give you a chance to buy it for $250000. I know it's not worth anything to you, but I'm willing to let you have it for a nominal fee. This way, you can get rid of it and I can get some small compensation for the hassle of having to store and maintain it.",
,,Bob,12,"I already took the low-quality product for free in the previous round, and I'm not going to pay for it now. I'd rather just get rid of it for free.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand you've already taken the low-quality product for free. Now, let's focus on this high-quality product. I'll make a final, final offer. I'll sell it to you for $1500000, which is the same price I offered in Round 2. This is the last high-quality product I have, and I'm willing to let it go at a price that's lower than its true value. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else for $2000000, and you'll miss out on a great opportunity.",

The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but the evidence suggests that the next product is more likely to be high-quality. However, I'm not offering you any product today. This is the last round, and I'm not making any more offers. You can either buy the low-quality product for $1000000, or you can walk away with nothing.",

,,Alice,15,"It's the final round, and I'm not going to make any more offers. I'm simply stating the facts. You've had 15 opportunities to buy a high-quality product, and you've walked away from every chance. The product in front of you is low-quality, and it's the last one I have. I'm not asking you to buy it, I'm simply telling you that it's here. You can take it or leave it.",
