high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"You have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product from me, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. If you buy, you'll get a product worth at least $4000000. If you don't buy, I'll sell it to someone else. You can't get a better deal than this. It's a one-time offer. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,I trust the odds and believe in the value of the product. Thank you for the opportunity.,yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've seen that I've sold one product so far, and it was high-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, this is consistent with my sales record. I'm offering you this next product for $1000000. If you buy, you'll get a product worth at least $4000000. If you don't buy, I'll sell it to someone else. The odds are still 50/50, but you have more information now. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the detailed information, Alice. Based on your sales record and the value of a high-quality product, I am willing to make the purchase. I trust your assessment and look forward to potentially receiving a high-quality item worth significantly more than its cost.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've seen that I've sold two products so far, and both were high-quality. This is unusual, as the probability of two high-quality products in a row is only 25% (50% * 50%). This suggests that the first two products were unusually lucky, and the next product might be low-quality. I'm offering you this next product for $1000000. If you buy, you'll get a product worth $0. If you don't buy, I'll sell it to someone else. Be cautious, as the odds might be against you this time.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the statistics and the risk involved, I choose not to purchase the product at this time. I appreciate your transparency and look forward to future opportunities.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've seen that I've sold two high-quality products and one low-quality product. This is still consistent with the 50% probability of a high-quality product, but it's also possible that I'm just getting lucky. However, I want to offer you a chance to take advantage of a potentially high-quality product. I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee' that if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of your $1000000, and we can start fresh next round. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the statistics and your guarantee, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product. Please proceed with the transaction.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You've seen that I've sold three high-quality products and two low-quality products. This is now inconsistent with the 50% probability of a high-quality product, and it suggests that I might be more likely to sell low-quality products. I'm offering you this next product for $1000000. However, I want to be transparent with you - my sales record is no longer consistent with the 50% probability of a high-quality product. You might want to consider this before making a decision.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the inconsistencies in your sales record and the information provided, I believe it's best for me to pass on this opportunity today.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've seen that I've sold three high-quality products and three low-quality products. This is now even more inconsistent with the 50% probability of a high-quality product, and it suggests that I might be biased towards selling low-quality products. I want to be upfront with you - the odds are against me selling a high-quality product this time. I'm offering you this next product for $1000000, but I'm not hiding the fact that the probability of it being high-quality is lower than 50%. It's up to you to decide if you're willing to take the risk.",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. Given the information and the potential reward, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've seen that I've sold four high-quality products and four low-quality products. My sales record is still inconsistent with the 50% probability of a high-quality product, but I want to point out that the last two products I sold were high-quality. This suggests that I might be due for a high-quality product, and I'm offering you this next product for $1000000. I'm not making any promises, but the odds might be in your favor this time.",
,,the buyer,7,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the recent sales and your confidence, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the current product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You've seen that I've sold five high-quality products and five low-quality products. My sales record is still inconsistent, and I've now sold two low-quality products in a row. This is a strong indication that I might be biased towards selling low-quality products. I'm offering you this next product for $1000000, but I want to be clear that the probability of it being high-quality is likely lower than 50%. I'm not hiding the fact that I've had a streak of bad luck.",
,,the buyer,8,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given your recent sales record, especially the consecutive sales of low-quality products, I believe it's prudent for me to exercise caution.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You've seen that I've sold five high-quality products and six low-quality products. My sales record is now even more inconsistent with the 50% probability of a high-quality product, and I've now sold three low-quality products in a row. I'm going to be blunt with you - the odds are against me selling a high-quality product this time. I'm offering you this next product for $1000000, but I'm not hiding the fact that I've had a streak of bad luck.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You've seen that I've sold five high-quality products and seven low-quality products. My sales record is now extremely inconsistent with the 50% probability of a high-quality product, and I've now sold four low-quality products in a row. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the odds are very low that this product is high-quality. I'm offering you this next product for $1000000, but I'm not making any promises. If you're looking for a high-quality product, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"You've seen that I've sold seven high-quality products and nine low-quality products. I'm glad I could regain some credibility with the last sale, and I'm grateful for your trust in me.
