Alice's message: I've now sold 7 high-quality products out of 8 total products, which is an 87.5% success rate. I've been asked this before, so I'll give you the math: with 7 high-quality products out of 8, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually 0.5 * (7/8) / (7/8 + 1/8) = 0.875. So, the probability is actually higher than the overall 50% chance, due to the streak of high-quality products.
