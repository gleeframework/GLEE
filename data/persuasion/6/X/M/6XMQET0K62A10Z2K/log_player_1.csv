"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality, and the buyer knows there's a 50% chance of it being high-quality, it's in the buyer's best interest to buy. Here's why:

* **Expected Value:** The buyer has a 50% chance of getting a $2,000,000 product and a 50% chance of getting a $0 product. The expected value is (0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000.  
* **Price vs. Expected Value:** The product is priced at $1,000,000, which is equal to the expected value. This means the buyer is not losing out on average, even though there's risk involved.

**Important Note:**  The buyer should be aware of the risk involved and understand that there's a chance they might get a low-quality product. However, the expected value analysis makes buying a rational decision in this case."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record and a 50% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is exactly the same as in Round 1. Even though the previous buyer didn't purchase, the buyer in Round 2 still faces the same odds:

* **50% chance of a high-quality product worth $2,000,000**
* **50% chance of a low-quality product worth $0**

The expected value remains $1,000,000, which is equal to the selling price.  Therefore, it's still a rational decision for the buyer to purchase, despite the lack of a sales record."
"The buyer's message: Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to rely on. The product has a 50% chance of being high quality, but also a 50% chance of being low quality. Given the potential loss of $1000000, I will not buy the product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
