**Reasoning:**

While the initial probability of a high-quality product was only 33.33%, Alice's track record shows a significant improvement with 13 out of 18 products being high quality. This suggests that Alice might have some knowledge or ability to influence the quality of the products she offers, even though she claims to randomly select them. 

The 60% discount and premium support package are further incentives that make the risk of buying a low-quality product less daunting, given the increased probability of a high-quality product based on Alice's sales history."
