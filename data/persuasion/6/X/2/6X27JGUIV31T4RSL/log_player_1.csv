"The buyer's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's quality, Alice. However, I'd like to do my own calculation based on the statistics. Since 3 out of 3 products sold so far are high-quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually 3/3 = 100%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to confirm that I'm not missing anything. Is there anything else you'd like to share before I make my final decision?
