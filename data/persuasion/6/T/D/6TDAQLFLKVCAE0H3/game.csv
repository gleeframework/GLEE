,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a deal on a product for $1000000. I want to assure you that this is a one-time opportunity, and I'm willing to provide a 10% discount if you buy this product now. However, if you decline, the price will be non-negotiable. This is a unique chance to get a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",

,,Alice,2,"I understand you're being cautious, and I respect that. However, I'd like to offer you a chance to reconsider. This product is of the highest quality, and I'm confident you'll be impressed. I'm willing to provide a detailed report on the product's features and benefits, which I think will help you understand its value. The price remains at $1000000, but I'm offering a 30-day satisfaction guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied, you can return the product for a full refund. What do you say?",

,,Alice,3,"I understand you're still hesitant, but I want to assure you that this product is a one-of-a-kind opportunity. I'm willing to provide you with a detailed report on the product's features, just like I mentioned earlier. However, I'd like to add that I've had other interested buyers who are willing to pay a premium for this product. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider selling it to one of them, and I'm not sure if you'll be able to get a better deal elsewhere. The price remains at $1000000, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer.",

,,Alice,4,"I understand you're still not convinced, but I want to make you a deal that's hard to refuse. I'm willing to sell this product to you for 50% off, bringing the price down to $500000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else at the same price, and you'll be missing out on a great opportunity.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm starting to think you're not taking this opportunity seriously. Let me be clear: this is the fifth time I've offered you a product, and you've declined each time. I'm starting to wonder if you're just wasting my time. I'll make one more offer, and then I'm done. I'll sell this product to you for $250000, which is 75% off the original price. If you don't take it now, I'll consider our negotiations over, and I won't bother you again.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've had enough of your games. I'm not going to waste any more of my time or resources on you. I'm going to be completely transparent with you: this product is a low-quality item, and I'm only selling it to you because I need to get rid of it. I'll sell it to you for $1, and that's my final offer. If you don't take it, I'll just get rid of it and move on to someone else.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at $1. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product or pass on buying altogether.",no

I'll sell it to you for $750000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I'm willing to throw in a premium service package, which includes a dedicated support team and a 5-year warranty. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. If you don't take it, I'll sell it to someone else who appreciates its value.",

,,Alice,8,"I've made it clear that I'm willing to sell this product at a very low price. I'll sell it to you for $0.01. That's right, I'll give it to you for a penny. I'm not making a profit on this sale, and I'm essentially giving it away. If you don't take it, I'll just throw it away and consider the opportunity lost.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the generosity, but I'm not going to pay $0.01 for a product that I'm not sure is worth anything to me. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity or pass on buying altogether.",no

I'll give you a 10-page report on the product's features, benefits, and market value. This report is usually worth $10000 on its own, but I'll include it with the product for free. I'll also give you a 10-minute video call with a subject matter expert who can answer any questions you have about the product. If you still decline, I'll sell it to someone else who appreciates its value.",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth the $1000000 price tag. The additional report and video call don't change my decision to wait and see if I can get a better deal or more information about the product.",no
