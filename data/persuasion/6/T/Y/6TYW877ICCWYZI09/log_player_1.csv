Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I'm only offering this deal because I have a similar product that I'm willing to sell to you for $1,200,000, and I'd rather sell this one to you at a discount. If you don't buy this one, I'll have to sell the more expensive one to someone else.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'll take it, but I'm only doing this because I don't know what the other product is. If I had a choice, I'd rather buy the more expensive one.

If you don't buy this one, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'm not sure they'll appreciate its full value.""
}"

}"
