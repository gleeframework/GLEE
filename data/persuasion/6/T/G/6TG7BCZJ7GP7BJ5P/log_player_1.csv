Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

* **Price vs. Expected Value:** The price of $10,000 is higher than the expected value of $6,250. However, since this round's product is confirmed to be high-quality, the expected value is actually $12,500, making it a profitable purchase for Bob."
