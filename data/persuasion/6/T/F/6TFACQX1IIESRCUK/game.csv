,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, as there's no prior data to go by and I'm essentially making an uninformed decision. I'm hoping for the best!"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't want to buy a low-quality product that's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyer didn't find it valuable, and I'd like to see more information about the product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get it for $500000, as I believe the low probability of a high-quality product is not worth the full price of $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as I think it's likely to be a low-quality product given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the products being offered are likely to be low-quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This suggests that the products sold so far are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyers and their decisions. Did they pass or buy the products?

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the current statistics and Alice's recommendation. Given that 2 previous buyers passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous two products were high quality, it suggests that the probability of the current product being high quality might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products, it's likely that the previous products were low quality, which means the probability of the current product being high quality is higher. I'm going to wait for the next product."
