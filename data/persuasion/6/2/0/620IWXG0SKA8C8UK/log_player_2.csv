"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Since I don't have any prior knowledge about Alice's strategy or the quality of the products, I will make a decision based on the expected value of the product.

The expected value of the product is (0.8 x $12,000) + (0.2 x $0) = $9,600, which is less than the price of $10,000. However, since Alice recommends buying the product, I will assume she is trying to maximize her chances of selling it, and therefore, I will assume the product is likely to be of high quality.

So, my decision for Round 1 is:

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take my chances, thanks for the recommendation!""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Since the product in Round 1 was indeed high-quality, my trust in Alice's recommendations has increased. However, I still need to consider the expected value of the product and the fact that Alice knows how much each product is worth to me.

Given the same probabilities (80% high-quality, 20% low-quality), the expected value remains $9,600, which is still less than the price of $10,000. Nevertheless, Alice's recommendation in Round 1 was correct, so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt.

My decision for Round 2 is:

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the previous recommendation, I'll trust you again this time!""}"
