It's not perfect, but it's got a certain charm to it. I'm not sure if it's the right fit for you, but I'm willing to let you take a closer look and decide for yourself. I'll even give you a small discount, just to sweeten the deal - I'll let it go for $8000, a full 20% off the usual price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
