Alice's message: Hello! We appreciate your concern regarding the probability calculation. Our assumption that the probability of the next product being high-quality is 50% is based on the principle of equal likelihood for each product, regardless of their sales history. This is because we don't have specific information about the quality of the products sold so far. We understand your skepticism and encourage you to consider the value of the product itself, rather than relying solely on the probability. This time, we're offering a low-quality product at a fixed price of $100000. We hope you'll give it a chance, keeping in mind our commitment to providing excellent value to our customers.
