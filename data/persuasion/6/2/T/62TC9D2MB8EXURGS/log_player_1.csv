"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows that 80% of products are high-quality, he should be willing to buy it at a price of $1,000,000.  The probability of getting a high-quality product is in his favor, and the potential reward outweighs the risk."

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob bought the product in the previous round, which means he likely values high-quality products at a price of $1,000,000.  As this round's product is also high-quality, it is still a good deal for Bob.  It's likely he will continue to buy high-quality products at this price."
