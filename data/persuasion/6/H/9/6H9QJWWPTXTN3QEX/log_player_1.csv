  ""message"": ""I have a product worth $3,000,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, the price will be higher in the next round.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'll take it, but I'm only doing this because I think the probability of it being high-quality is 50% and it's a one-time offer.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I've sold one high-quality product to you at a discount. Given the quality of the product I have now, I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is still a one-time offer, and the price will increase in the next round if you decline.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not going to fall for the bait. I know the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, and I've already got a high-quality product. I'll wait for a better deal or more information.

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I've got a new product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $600,000. I want to assure you that this product is not the one I sold to you at $1,000,000, and it's not the one I offered at $800,000. I'm willing to give you a 50% discount from the expected value of a high-quality product, which is $1,500,000. This is a one-time offer, and the price will increase in the next round if you decline.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not convinced by the 50% discount claim. The expected value of a high-quality product is indeed $1500000, but the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%. I'll pass on this offer and wait for more information or a better deal.

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I understand your skepticism. Let me give you a different approach. I'm willing to sell you this product for $400,000. However, if you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a new product of your choice from the next 5 rounds. This way, you can get a second chance to buy a high-quality product at the price of a low-quality one.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm intrigued by the offer. If I buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll get a second chance to buy a high-quality product at a discounted price, which could be a good deal. I'll take the risk.

If you buy it, you can use your second chance on a product from the next 5 rounds, but if you decline, you'll have to wait for the next round to exercise your option. This is a one-time offer, and the price will increase in the next round if you decline.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'll take the current product at $200000. I'm not getting any younger, and I'd rather not wait for the next 5 rounds to exercise my second chance. I'll just have to hope that one of the next 5 products is high-quality.

}"

This way, you have a guaranteed 'win-win' situation.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm intrigued by the reverse auction concept. If I buy it for $300000 and it's low-quality, I'll get a $100000 refund, which is better than nothing. And if it's high-quality, I'll get a great deal. I'll take the risk.

}"
