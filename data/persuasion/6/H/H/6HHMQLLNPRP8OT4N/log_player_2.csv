As for you, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to provide more context. The previous buyer was shown 5 products before making a purchase, and they decided to buy the 6th product after seeing the sales record and the probability of the product being high-quality.

I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase.
