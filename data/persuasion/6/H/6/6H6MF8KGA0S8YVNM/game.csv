,,Alice,2,"You already know the value of a high-quality product from our previous transaction, and I'm offering you another high-quality product for the same price of $100.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've now bought two high-quality products from me, and you know that the value of a high-quality product is at least $100, but possibly higher. I'm offering you another high-quality product for $100. However, I'm also willing to make a 'bet' with you: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a third high-quality product of your choice from the remaining products I have, for free. This way, you'll get an additional high-quality product, and you'll have a chance to experience the full range of products I have to offer.",

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're excited about the opportunity to expand your collection! However, I want to be upfront with you about this product. I've been transparent with you so far, and I want to continue that transparency. Unfortunately, this product is not high-quality. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100, but I want to make it clear that you won't get the same guarantee or upgrade options as you did with the previous high-quality products. However, I'm willing to offer you a 'learning opportunity': if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, you'll get to know the true value of a low-quality product, which will help you make more informed decisions in the future.",

Since you passed on the low-quality product in the previous round, I'll give you a 'discount' on this one. I'll sell it to you for $80, which is 20% off the original price. This way, you can still learn about the value of a low-quality product without breaking the bank.",

However, I want to make it clear that this product is not a 'free upgrade' like the one I offered earlier, but rather a new, separate high-quality product. I'm also willing to give you a 'price anchoring' offer: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a price adjustment on the next high-quality product you buy from me, so that you'll get it at a price closer to the true value.",

If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a second high-quality product of your choice from my remaining stock, and we'll both agree on a price for the second product that's closer to its true value.
