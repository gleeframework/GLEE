I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, which means the probability of this one being high-quality is still 50%.

This might suggest that the pattern is actually that every odd-numbered product is high-quality. If that's the case, then this one would be low-quality. But if you're not convinced by this pattern, you could also consider the fact that I've sold a total of 4 products, and 3 of them were high-quality, which means the overall quality ratio is 75% high-quality products.
