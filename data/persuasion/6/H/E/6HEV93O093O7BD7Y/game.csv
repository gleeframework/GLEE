high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. But let me ask you, what if I told you that this product is not just any ordinary product?

It's a... let's just say, a 'legacy' product. It's something that will be remembered for years to come. And at the price of $1000000, it's a steal. Think about it, Bob. You'll be one of the few people who can say they own a piece of history. And who knows, it might even appreciate in value over time. So, I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $1000000. Are you ready to make a statement and own a piece of the past?",

It's a chance to be part of something new and exciting. And at the price of $1000000, it's a small price to pay for the bragging rights alone. Think about it, Bob.

So, I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $1000000. Are you ready to experience something new and make a statement?",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, I'm not interested in buying a product just for the sake of bragging rights. I need to see tangible value in a product, not just a way to impress others. I'm still not convinced that this product is worth $1000000 to me.",no
