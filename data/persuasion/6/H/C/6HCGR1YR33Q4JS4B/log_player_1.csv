  ""message"": ""I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, but that's just a coincidence, right? The probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. However, I want to point out that you're now facing a situation where I've sold 4 high-quality products, and you're considering buying the 5th one. If you don't buy, I'll have sold 4 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, which would imply that I'm selling high-quality products at a rate of 80%.

I'm not saying that's the case, but it's something to consider. The price is $10000. You have to decide if you want to take a chance on this product or not.""
}"
