low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, considering the seller's previous sales record and Alice's recommendation."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'm not sure what's going on with the previous two buyers, but I'm willing to take a chance"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and no high-quality products sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, can you tell me more about the product's quality based on the statistics?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information to go on and Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be based on any relevant information. I'm essentially taking a wild guess."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer given the previous 5 sales?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation doesn't change my perception of the product's quality. I'll wait for a more favorable situation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product has been reduced. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. I'm aware that your recommendation is against buying it, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the probability of the product being high quality, which is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the previous buyers were likely low-quality products and that the recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 6, which is 0%. This is lower than the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product. I'm hesitant to buy, especially since the seller has not recommended the product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that your recommendation is based on the low quality of the product, which would make it a good deal for me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the statistics, it seems like you've been recommending low-quality products to the previous buyers. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm going to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation, I'm skeptical about the product's quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous 7 buyers have gotten a high-quality product.

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $6000 for it, considering the low probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
