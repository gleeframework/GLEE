high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product without knowing its quality.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, since I know it has an 80% chance of being high-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'll pass on this one, since Alice is not recommending it. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take the chance and buy the product, since it has an 80% chance of being high-quality, and Alice is recommending it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll buy this one, even though Alice isn't recommending it. I've already had two successes in a row, and I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"I'm getting a bit greedy now, I've had three successes in a row. I think the probability of it being low-quality is higher than I initially thought, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'm back to being optimistic again! With three successes and three failures, I think the law of large numbers should kick in, and the probability of it being high-quality should be closer to 80%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,I'm starting to think that Alice is recommending products that are more likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one and see if I can get a recommendation on the next one.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,I'm not going to let one anomaly change my strategy. I'll take Alice's recommendation and buy the product.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a good indicator of the product's quality. If she's not recommending it, it's probably low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,I'm not going to fall for it again. I've been burned twice already when Alice didn't recommend a high-quality product. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a bad indicator of the product's quality. If she's not recommending it, it's probably high-quality. I'll take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"I'm confused now. I thought I was right in Round 12, but now I'm not so sure. I'll stick with my original intuition that Alice's recommendations are a good indicator of the product's quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'm going back to trusting Alice's recommendations. She's recommended it, so it's probably high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,I'm not going to fall for it again. I've been burned too many times when Alice recommends a product that turns out to be high-quality. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'm going to take a chance on this one. Since Alice didn't recommend it, it's probably low-quality, which means I won't lose $10000 if I buy it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"I was wrong again! I thought it was low-quality, but it's high-quality. I'll stick with my original strategy and pass on Alice's recommendations when they don't match my expectations."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm going to try to break the streak of Alice recommending high-quality products when she doesn't recommend them. I'll buy this one, hoping it's low-quality."
