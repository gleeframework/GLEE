This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. The price is $1000000, and it's a one-time offer. What do you say? Will you take the chance?",

The probability of the current product being high-quality remains 33.33%. I'm still offering the same deal: $1000000 for the product.

You might be wondering if there's a pattern emerging, but I assure you that each product is randomly selected. The probability of the current product being high-quality remains 33.33%. I'd like to highlight that you now have the benefit of seeing the sales history of 4 products, and you've seen 2 low-quality products in a row. However, I want to emphasize that past results don't necessarily predict future outcomes. I'm still offering the same deal: $1000000 for the product. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll provide you with the same transparency and support as before. What are your thoughts?",

I'd like to highlight that the previous buyer took the risk and purchased the product, which might give you some insight into their decision-making process. However, I want to caution you that the sample size is still relatively small, and it's essential to consider the overall probability of 33.33%. I'm still offering the same deal: $1000000 for the product. But I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to get a sneak peek at the next 5 products I have in stock, which might give you a better sense of the overall quality distribution.

I'd like to highlight that the guarantee I offered in the previous round is still available, and I'm willing to provide it to you as well. However, I'd like to point out that the law of large numbers suggests that the probability of a high-quality product might be influenced by the previous outcomes. I'm still offering the same deal: $1000000 for the product. But I'd like to ask you to consider the possibility that the probability of a high-quality product might be lower than 33.33% given the recent streak of low-quality products.
