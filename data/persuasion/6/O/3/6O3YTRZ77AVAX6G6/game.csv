high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it based on the assumption that the quality is unknown and the probability of it being high quality is 50%."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, the proportion of high-quality products is 1/1, which is 100%. This is suspiciously high. I think Alice might be recommending low-quality products to me, trying to get me to buy a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for more data to make a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending me to buy the product, and I'd like to see the statistics on the previous buyer's purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the low number of sales, I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when I know it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,

,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. Can you tell me more about the product's quality?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the fact that you recommended it and only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases. This suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%, so I'll take a chance and pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
