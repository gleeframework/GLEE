As for the probability of a high-quality product, I can tell you that out of the products I've sold so far, 50% of them have been high-quality, and the other 50% have been low-quality. However, I want to point out that you're not just buying a product - you're buying a 50% chance of getting a $1200000 product. It's a calculated risk, but one that could pay off big time. Would you like to take the chance and buy this product for $1000000?

Alice's message: I see you're a sharp buyer who's paying attention to the details. I'll be upfront with you - the discrepancy you're referring to is due to the fact that the first product I sold was high-quality, which skewed the statistics. If I had sold a low-quality product first, the statistics would be more in line with the expected probability. However, I want to assure you that the selection process is truly random, and the odds are still 50/50. Out of the 7 products I've sold so far, 5 have been high-quality and 2 have been low-quality. That's a 71.4% chance of a high-quality product, but I still believe the true probability is 50%. The price remains the same: $1000000 for a 50% chance of a $1200000 product. What do you think?

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to provide more information about my selection process. I use a random number generator to select the product from a pool of products.

I'm not trying to hide anything from you, and I want to assure you that the odds are still 50/50. Out of the 8 products I've sold so far, 6 have been high-quality and 2 have been low-quality.
