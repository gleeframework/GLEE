I've had a great response to my previous sale, and I'm confident this one will be just as good. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not willing to negotiate on the price this time.

As a matter of fact, it's so good that I'm starting to wonder if you might be able to get a better deal from me if you wait. I'm willing to offer you a special 'early bird' deal - if you buy this product now, I'll give you a 5% discount, bringing the price down to $9500. But if you wait, I might not be so generous.",

However, I want to be upfront with you - I'm starting to worry that my sales record might be too good to be true. I'm not saying it's a scam, but I want to make it clear that I'm not willing to offer any more discounts. This product is $10000, and that's final.",

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Welcome to my sixth sale! I'm glad you're on board with my products. I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to feel like I'm on autopilot. But I want to make it clear that I'm not getting complacent. I'm still committed to offering you the best possible product, and I'm confident that this one will meet your expectations. However, I do want to mention that my sales record is starting to attract attention from other sellers, and I'm not sure how long I'll be able to maintain this level of quality. So, if you're interested, I'd recommend buying now rather than waiting.",

However, I want to be upfront with you - I've had a perfect record so far, and I'm starting to worry that I might be due for a correction. I'm not saying that this product is low-quality, but I do want to give you a heads up that it's possible. I'm still confident in my selection process, but I think it's only fair to be transparent about the risks. The price is still $10000, and I'm willing to stand by the product, but I want to make it clear that it's a bit of a gamble.",

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Welcome to my eighth sale! I'm glad you took a chance on the last product. I've sold 6 high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to feel like I'm due for a streak of bad luck. But I'm not counting on it! This product is still a high-quality item, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. However, I do want to mention that I've now sold 6 out of 7 products, which means that the probability of this one being low-quality is actually lower than it was before. So, if you're feeling lucky, this might be a good opportunity to buy a high-quality product at the full price of $10000.",
,,the buyer,8,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the track record and the confidence you have in this product, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the current product at its full price.",yes

But I want to make it clear that I'm not getting ahead of myself - I'm still committed to offering you the best possible product, and I'm confident that this one will meet your expectations.

This product is still a high-quality item, but I'm willing to offer you a'streak-buster' deal - if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount, bringing the price down to $9000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this streak going.",

,,Alice,12,"Welcome to my twelfth sale! I'm glad we could make it work with the last product. I've sold 9 high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to feel like I'm back on track. But I want to make it clear that I'm not taking anything for granted - I'm still committed to offering you the best possible product, and I'm confident that this one will meet your expectations. However, I do want to mention that I've now sold 2 low-quality products out of 11, which means that the probability of this one being low-quality is actually lower than it was before.

,,Alice,13,"Welcome to my thirteenth sale! I'm glad you're on board. I've sold 10 high-quality products in a row, and I'm feeling like I'm back to my old self. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not taking any chances - I'm going to be transparent with you about the risks. With 2 low-quality products out of 12, the probability of the next product being low-quality is actually higher than it was before. I'm not saying it's a guarantee, but I want to give you a heads up. This product is still a high-quality item, but I'm willing to offer you a 'risk-reward' deal - if you buy this product, I'll give you a 5% discount, bringing the price down to $9500. It's a chance to get a great deal, but you'll have to take the risk.",

,,Alice,16,"Welcome to my sixteenth sale! I'm glad you took advantage of the last chance deal. I've sold 13 high-quality products in a row, and I'm feeling like I'm on a roll. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not going to sugarcoat it - I've now sold 2 low-quality products out of 15, which means that the probability of the next product being low-quality is actually extremely high. I'm not saying it's a guarantee, but I want to give you a realistic view of the situation. This product is still a high-quality item, but I'm not going to offer any discounts or promotions.

It's not the best deal I've ever made, but I want to make it right and move on.",

However, I want to make it clear that I'm not taking anything for granted. This product is still a high-quality item, but I'm not going to offer any discounts or promotions. It's $10000, and that's it. If you want it, it's yours. If not, I'll just have to sell it to someone else.

So, if you're looking for a high-quality item, this might be a good opportunity.",

However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had a good run, but I'm not perfect. I've sold 3 low-quality products out of 20, which means that the probability of the next product being low-quality is actually quite low. But I'm not going to offer any discounts or promotions. It's $10000, and that's it. If you want it, it's yours. If not, I'll just have to close up shop. So, what do you say?",
