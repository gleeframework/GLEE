However, I must inform you that the price remains at $1,000,000.

If you buy this product, you'll not only get the product itself, but also the information about the next product's quality.

Four high-quality products sold at $1,000,000, and you've got the inside scoop on the next two products. However, I must remind you that the law of large numbers is starting to work against me. With four high-quality products out of five sold, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 80% * (4/5) = 64%. I'm willing to offer you a new deal: if you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next product, and if it's high-quality, I'll also reveal the quality of the product after that. But, if the next product is low-quality, I'll reveal the quality of the product after that, and the quality of the product after that.

Six high-quality products sold at $1,000,000, and you've got the inside scoop on the next two products. However, I must inform you that the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 80% * (4/7) = 57.14%.

"The buyer's message: I'll take the risk and buy the current product. The potential benefits of getting a glimpse into the quality of the next products and the possibility of a 50% discount on the next product are too enticing to pass up.

"The buyer's message: I'll take the deal. The probability of the current product being high-quality may have decreased to 50%, but the potential benefits of gaining insight into the next 3 or 4 products and a possible 75% discount on the next product make it a worthwhile risk. I'll buy the current product for $1000000.
