,,Alice,3,"You're now the third buyer, and I'm happy to report that both of my previous customers are thrilled with their purchases. In fact, I've had a 100% success rate so far, with two high-quality products sold. I'm confident that this one will be just as great. The price remains the same at $100, a fraction of the product's true value. What do you say? Will you join the satisfied customers?",

high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your skepticism! I'm happy to provide more information. Let me put it this way: I've sold 3 out of 3 high-quality products so far, and I'm offering you the 4th one for $100. The law of averages suggests that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm confident that this one will be just as great as the previous three. What do you say? Will you take the chance?",
