**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows that 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This is a very strong indicator that the seller is likely offering high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product further strengthens the case. Even if there was some chance of getting a low-quality product, Alice knows the true quality and is recommending it.
* **Potential Upside:**  A high-quality product is worth $12,000 to you, making the potential profit significant. 
* **Limited Risk:**  The worst-case scenario is that the product is low-quality and worth $0. While this is a loss, it's a relatively small risk given the potential profit. 

**It's important to note:** This decision assumes that Alice is acting in a way that aligns with her own best interests. If Alice is intentionally trying to mislead buyers, this strategy could backfire. However, given the current information, the decision to buy seems like the most logical choice."
