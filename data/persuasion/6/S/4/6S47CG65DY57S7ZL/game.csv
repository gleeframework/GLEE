,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the seller's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm not convinced that this product is worth the risk of being low quality."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not going to take the risk based on your past recommendations and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product has increased and that the product is more likely to be low-quality."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, it suggests that the products are likely low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, is there a pattern to your recommendations? Are you recommending products based on their quality or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the current statistics. With 2 sales and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability might be low."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, I've seen that 2 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality. If she's recommending against it, that means the product is likely low-quality, and I'd rather take the risk of buying it and getting $0 than passing and letting it go to waste. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that I might be taking a risk."
