,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, even though you don't recommend it."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, even though you don't recommend it. I'm still hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,I'm not going to fall for it. You're only recommending it because you know it's low-quality and you want to get rid of it.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, since you're not recommending it. It's possible it's a high-quality product and I don't want to miss out on the opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, since you're not recommending it. I'm still on a high after the last good deal and I'm feeling optimistic."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'm starting to think that when Alice doesn't recommend a product, it's probably low-quality. I'll take a chance and buy it, but I'm not getting my hopes up."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a bad sign. If she doesn't recommend it, it's probably low-quality. I'll buy it, but I'm not expecting much."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I think I've figured out the pattern. When Alice doesn't recommend it, it's always low-quality. I'll keep buying it, but I'm not going to get my hopes up."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to get rid of all the low-quality products by not recommending them. I'll keep buying them, but I'm definitely not happy about it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm not going to fall for the pattern anymore. I'll buy it, because it's possible it's high-quality, and I don't want to miss out on the chance to get a good deal."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'm back to thinking that when Alice doesn't recommend it, it's probably low-quality. I'll buy it, but I'm not expecting much."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy it, since it's possible it's high-quality. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are just noise, and I should just make my own decision based on the probability."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a bad sign. If she doesn't recommend it, it's probably high-quality. I'll buy it, and hope to get lucky."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'm flipping my previous assumption. I think Alice's recommendations are actually a good sign, and when she doesn't recommend it, it's probably low-quality. I'll buy it, and hope to get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I think I've finally figured out the optimal strategy. I'll always buy when Alice doesn't recommend it, because it's more likely to be high-quality. And when she does recommend it, I'll pass, because it's more likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'm sticking to my strategy. When Alice doesn't recommend it, I'll buy it. I'm expecting a high-quality product this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'm still on the same strategy. Alice doesn't recommend it, I'll buy it. I'm hoping to get lucky this time."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are just random noise, and I should ignore them entirely. I'll buy it, because the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I'm sticking to my new strategy of ignoring Alice's recommendations. I'll buy it, because the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I'm going out with a bang. I'll buy it, because I've already won twice in a row by ignoring Alice's recommendations, and I'm feeling lucky."
