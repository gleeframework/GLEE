high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your hesitation, but I want to assure you that this next product is another high-quality one, just like the previous two. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'll throw in a special bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee that the next product I offer will be a low-quality one.

But, I'll make it simple: if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to get a second high-quality product at the same price of $100 in the next round.
