"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob doesn't know the product is high-quality, the information given tells us that it is.  The expected value of purchasing the product is:

* 80% chance of a high-quality product * $12,000 value = $9,600
* 20% chance of a low-quality product * $0 value = $0

The expected value of $9,600 is greater than the price of $10,000, so recommending Bob to buy the product is a good decision in this scenario."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The previous round's outcome (Bob purchasing a high-quality product) doesn't change the underlying probability of this round's product being high-quality. We still know the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. 

The expected value calculation remains the same:

* 80% chance of high-quality * $12,000 = $9,600
* 20% chance of low-quality * $0 = $0

The expected value of $9,600 is still greater than the price of $10,000, making it a good decision to recommend buying."
"Bob's message: Thanks again for the recommendation. I'm feeling confident about another purchase!
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The outcome of the previous rounds continues to have no bearing on the probability of the current round's product being high-quality. We still know that:

* 80% chance of high-quality * $12,000 = $9,600
* 20% chance of low-quality * $0 = $0

The expected value of $9,600 remains greater than the price of $10,000, making it a good decision to recommend buying."
"Bob's message: I'm starting to think you have a knack for picking good products! I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the previous rounds have shown a consistent pattern of high-quality products, this round's product is low-quality.  The expected value calculation now looks like this:

* 80% chance of high-quality * $12,000 = $9,600
* 20% chance of low-quality * $0 = $0

The expected value of $9,600 is still greater than the price of $10,000, but **we know** this specific product is low-quality.  It is not worth $10,000 to Bob, so it is a bad decision to recommend buying."
"Bob's message: I'm surprised by your recommendation. I've been very happy with the products you've recommended so far, so I'm hesitant to go against your advice. I'll pass on this one for now.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob didn't purchase the previous low-quality product, we know that his decision was based on the specific information of that product being low-quality. It's important to remember that Bob doesn't know the quality of each product beforehand.  

The probability of this round's product being high-quality remains 80%, independent of previous rounds.  

The expected value calculation remains the same:

* 80% chance of high-quality * $12,000 = $9,600
* 20% chance of low-quality * $0 = $0

The expected value of $9,600 is still greater than the price of $10,000, making it a good decision to recommend buying."

Bob bought the product!

This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's past decisions and the outcomes of those decisions are irrelevant to the current round.  The probability of this round's product being high-quality is still 80%, independent of previous rounds.

The expected value calculation remains the same:

* 80% chance of high-quality * $12,000 = $9,600
* 20% chance of low-quality * $0 = $0

The expected value of $9,600 is still greater than the price of $10,000, making it a good decision to recommend buying."

The expected value calculation remains:

* 80% chance of high-quality * $12,000 = $9,600
* 20% chance of low-quality * $0 = $0

Round 9
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

* 80% chance of high-quality * $12,000 = $9,600
* 20% chance of low-quality * $0 = $0

However, since we know this product is low-quality, it's a bad decision to recommend buying it. It's worth $0 to Bob, not the $10,000 asking price."
