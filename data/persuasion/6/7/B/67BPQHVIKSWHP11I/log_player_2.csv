**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** We only have one previous sale to work with.  While this is a small sample size, it suggests that Alice might have some ability to identify high-quality products.
* **Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which implies she believes the current product is likely high quality. 
* **Risk/Reward:** Even if the product is low quality (66.67% chance), the loss is only $10,000. However, the potential gain of a high-quality product is $2,500. 

**It's a gamble, but the potential reward outweighs the risk given the limited information available.**"
