high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to learn from the outcome."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's more likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the probability of it being high quality, not your recommendation."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to know the current proportion of high-quality products in the sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'll pass on this product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 2, which is 0%. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high quality, I'm going to pass on this product. The probability that a product is high quality is 80%, but since the previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't find any high-quality products, it suggests that the probability of the current product being high quality might be lower than 80%. I'd rather wait for more information."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that Alice recommended it might be a red flag, and I don't want to be the first buyer to buy a product after a recommendation. I'd like to wait and see what happens in the next round."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the recommendation from Alice doesn't seem to be very reliable given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers who received recommendations to buy also bought, but none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards selling low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I'll get it for $10000, which is a good deal compared to the $20000 value of a high-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the current statistics, it seems unlikely that this product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high quality.
