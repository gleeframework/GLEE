"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued interest in selling me this product. However, I still need more information to make an informed decision.

"Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the discount offer, I'm still not convinced.  Your 'je ne sais quoi' description doesn't provide me with any tangible information about the product's quality.  I need concrete evidence or a more significant price reduction before I can consider buying.

```"
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, 'innovative design' and 'cutting-edge solution' are vague descriptions that don't address my concerns about quality. The lack of any concrete evidence or a price adjustment makes it impossible for me to justify the purchase at this time. I'm willing to revisit this conversation if you can provide more substantial information about the product.

"Bob's message: Alice, while the offer of a detailed report is tempting, I still need more than just words to convince me.  The price remains a significant barrier, and I'm not convinced that the report alone will provide the necessary evidence to justify the purchase.  I appreciate the effort to build my trust, but I need concrete proof, such as independent verification of the 'revolutionary process' or a substantial price reduction before I can seriously consider buying.

```"
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer to see images, but 'limited edition,' 'highest quality materials,' and 'meticulous attention to detail' are still subjective terms.  I need more than just marketing buzzwords to justify a purchase at this price.  The potential for future appreciation is a tempting prospect, but I need concrete evidence of the product's quality and value before I can commit.
