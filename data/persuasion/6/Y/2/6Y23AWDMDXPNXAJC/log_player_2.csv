Round 14
Alice's message: I completely understand, Bob. I respect your decision. However, I want to ask you a question: have you considered that I might be trying to throw you a curveball?

Maybe I'm willing to give you a low-quality product because I know you'll be able to negotiate a better deal. Am I right?
