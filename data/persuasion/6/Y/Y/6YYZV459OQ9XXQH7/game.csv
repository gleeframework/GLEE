,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to take a chance and pass on it. If all 3 previous buyers passed on high-quality products, it would mean that 3/3 = 100% of the previous products were low-quality, which is not possible given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality. Therefore, it's more likely that the previous buyers passed on low-quality products, and I'm going to take a chance on this product."
