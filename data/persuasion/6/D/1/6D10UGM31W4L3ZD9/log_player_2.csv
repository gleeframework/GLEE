Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying it. I'm not convinced it's a high-quality product, and even if it is, I don't think the discount is enough to justify the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product.""}"

If you buy it from me, you'll be getting it at a significant discount. I'm willing to give you an additional 10% off the original price, making it $180. This is the best deal you'll find anywhere, and I'm confident you won't regret it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hesitant to take the risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not convinced it's a good deal. I still think I can get a better value by waiting for more information.
