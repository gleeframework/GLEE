It's time to be bold and try a new approach.  This is a high-quality product and you need to convince this buyer.  

Here's what you can do:

* **Address the Buyer's Concern:**  Acknowledge their request for more information and provide the sales data: ""You're right to be cautious, and I understand your need for transparency.  So far, I've had 9 potential buyers.  Of those, I've sold 2 products, and both of them were unfortunately low-quality."" 
* **Highlight the Value:**  ""However, this product is different.  It's one of the best I've come across, and I truly believe it's worth the investment.  I'm willing to stand by my recommendation."" 
* **Build Trust:**  ""I'm working hard to build trust and establish a reputation for offering quality products.  I want to show you that I'm not just trying to make a sale, but to provide value.""

This approach addresses the buyer's concerns about your track record, highlights the value of the current product, and demonstrates your commitment to building trust.  It might just convince them to take a chance."

* **Be Transparent:**  ""It's true, I've had a string of low-quality products.  But I'm committed to offering quality items, and I'm constantly learning and improving my process.  This product is different, and I'm confident in its value.""
* **Explain Your Decision:** ""I'm recommending this product because it's genuinely high-quality.  I'm not just trying to make a sale, but to build trust with you and show you that I can offer valuable products.""
* **Offer Incentive:** ""To show my confidence in this product, I'm willing to offer a small bonus if you purchase it.  This way, you're not only getting a great product, but you're also getting a little extra for taking a chance on me.""

Here's how you can approach this:

* **Acknowledge the Past:** ""You're right to be cautious, and I understand your skepticism based on my past record.  I've had some tough luck with low-quality products, but I'm determined to change that.""
* **Emphasize Quality:** ""This product is genuinely different, and I'm confident in its quality.  I'm willing to put my reputation on the line and offer a money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied.""
* **Offer Transparency:** ""To show my commitment to transparency, I'm willing to share more information about this product.  I can show you [insert details like manufacturing process, certifications, or reviews] to demonstrate its value.""
