,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product for now. I want to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if I can trust your assessment of the product's quality based on past sales data, and I'm willing to take the risk."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 buyers have already passed on the product despite your recommendation, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products in the pool might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 buyers who received a recommendation from you to buy a product ended up buying it, but neither of the products were of high quality. This suggests that your recommendation may not be reliable. I would like to pass on this product and see if I can get a recommendation from you when I'm the 4th buyer."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product, and Alice's recommendation doesn't carry much weight given the lack of evidence of high-quality products being sold."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the statistics, the fact that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products suggests that the products they were recommended to buy were likely low-quality.

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I think it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
