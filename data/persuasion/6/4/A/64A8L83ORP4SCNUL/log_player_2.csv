**Reasoning:**

While the odds are stacked against us (66.67% chance of a low-quality product), there are a few factors to consider:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice knows the true quality of the product. Her recommendation is a strong signal that the product is likely high-quality. 
* **Previous Sales:** One high-quality product being sold is a positive sign. It suggests that Alice's recommendations are not completely random, and she might be able to identify some high-quality products. 
* **Potential Gain:** The potential reward ($2,000,000) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000).

**Overall:**  The risk is high, but the potential reward is worth taking the gamble, especially with Alice's recommendation."
