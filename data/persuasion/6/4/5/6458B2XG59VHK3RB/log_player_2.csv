Alice's message: Thank you for considering our product! We understand your hesitation, and we're happy to report that our sales record is still 1 out of 1 high-quality product. However, we'd like to remind you that even the most experienced sellers have occasional variations in their products. For just $10000, you'll be taking a calculated risk.
