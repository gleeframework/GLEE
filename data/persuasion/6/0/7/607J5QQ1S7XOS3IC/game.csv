high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! This next one is also high-quality, and I'm willing to make a similar offer. However, I'm willing to compromise on the price. I'll let it go for $525000. It's a great opportunity to own another high-quality product at a relatively low price.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure I can get a better deal than the last one, and I'm not sure if this one is really worth the extra $25000. Can I pass for now? I'll think about it.",no

,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not convinced that this product is worth the price. I've passed on two high-quality products already, and I'm starting to think that Alice's products are not as valuable as she claims. I'll have to pass again.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your honesty. I want to be transparent with you - this product is indeed not one of my best. However, it's still a solid product that can provide some value. I'm willing to let it go for $300000, which is a significant discount from my usual price. I'm doing this as a gesture of goodwill, hoping to regain your trust and show you that I'm committed to finding you a product that meets your expectations.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not convinced that this product is worth the price. You've already shown me three high-quality products that I passed on, and now you're offering me a lower-quality product at a discounted price. I'm starting to think that Alice's products are not as valuable as I thought, and I'm not willing to take a chance on a lower-quality product at any price.",no

I'm doing this as a loss leader, hoping to get you to reconsider buying a high-quality product from me in the future.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product at any price.

I'm waiting for a high-quality product at a reasonable price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your stance, and I respect your priorities. However, I want to make one final offer on this product. I'll let it go for $200000, which is a very low price for any product. I'm essentially giving it away at this point. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next round, and we can start fresh with a new product.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the low price, but I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product. I'm not going to pay any price for something that's not valuable to me. I'm waiting for a high-quality product at a reasonable price.",no

I have a limited number of products left, and I want to make sure I'm offering you the best possible options.

I've been holding onto this one, but I'm not confident it's worth the usual price. I'll let it go for $150000, which is a very low price for any product. I'm essentially giving it away at this point. If you're not interested, I'll be honest with you - I don't have any more high-quality products left, and I'm not sure what else I can offer you.",

This next product is another high-quality one, and I'm willing to make a similar offer to what we agreed on last time. I'll let it go for $400000, which is a great value considering its quality. I'm confident you'll find it meets your expectations, and I'm willing to take a slightly smaller profit margin to make it happen.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not sure I'm interested in paying $400000 for a product that I know is worth $1250000 to me. I already got a good deal on the last product, and I'm not sure I want to pay more for another high-quality product. Can you meet me at $375000 or lower?",no
