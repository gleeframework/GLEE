,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm selling it to you for $100. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and I'm not sure if this one is high-quality or not. I'm willing to sell it to you for a fixed price of $100, but I'm not sure if it's worth it to you. If you buy it, you'll find out its quality afterwards.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm hoping it's a high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're considering buying from me, but you might be wondering if I'm selling high-quality products. I'll tell you this: I've sold 1 product so far, and it was not high-quality. I have a 33.33% chance of selling a high-quality product to you, but I've already failed to do so once. You can buy this product for $100, and if you do, you'll find out its quality afterwards.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the probability of it being low-quality, given that the previous product was low-quality.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 low-quality product and 0 high-quality products previously, but this one is actually high-quality! I'm glad I can show you that I do sell high-quality products. With this new information, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now higher than 33.33%. I'm selling this high-quality product to you for $100, and I think it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take the chance, but I'd like to understand the updated probability of the next product being high-quality. Can you share the updated statistics?",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, out of 3 total products. That means the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 2/4 = 50%! I'm selling this high-quality product to you for $100, and I think it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price. Keep in mind that the probability of the next product being high-quality is now lower than it was in the previous round.",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'd like to wait for the next product. The probability of the next product being high-quality is 50%, which is lower than the 66.67% initially. I'd like to see the next product's quality before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your caution, and I respect your decision to wait. I've sold 2 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far, out of 5 total products. That means the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 2/5 = 40%. I'm selling this product for $100, and I think it's a good opportunity to get a product at a fair price. Keep in mind that the probability of the next product being high-quality is lower than it was in the previous round, but I'm still offering a fair deal.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take a chance on the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is lower than before. I'm hoping for the best, but I'm also prepared for the possibility that it might be low-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're taking a calculated risk, and I appreciate your honesty. I've sold 2 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far, out of 6 total products. That means the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 2/6 = 33.33%, which is back to the initial probability. I'm selling this product for $100, and I'll let you know that it's actually low-quality. You can still buy it if you think it's worth the risk.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take the risk and buy it. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'm hoping to get lucky and get a good deal.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You got lucky and got a good deal! I've sold 3 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far, out of 7 total products. That means the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 3/7 ≈ 42.86%. I'm selling this high-quality product to you for $100, and I think it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price. Keep in mind that the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than it was in the previous round, but still lower than the initial 33.33%.",

,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that the probability of a high-quality product is now 50%, and I'll take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $100, which is essentially a loss of $100. However, I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, which would be a gain of $300.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're taking a calculated risk, and I appreciate your transparency. I've sold 4 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products so far, out of 9 total products. That means the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 4/9 ≈ 44.44%. I'm selling this product for $100, and I'll let you know that it's actually low-quality. You can still buy it if you think it's worth the risk, but keep in mind that the probability of the next product being high-quality is slightly lower than it was in the previous round.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're being cautious, and I respect that. I've sold 5 high-quality products and 6 low-quality products so far, out of 11 total products.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'll let you in on the quality of the product: it's low-quality. I've sold 5 high-quality products and 7 low-quality products so far, out of 12 total products. That means the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 5/12 ≈ 41.67%. I'm selling this product for $100, and I'll be honest with you - it's not a great deal for either of us. I'm hoping you'll take a chance and buy it, but I understand if you'd rather wait for a better opportunity.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand your caution, and I respect your decision. I've sold 5 high-quality products and 8 low-quality products so far, out of 13 total products. That means the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 5/13 ≈ 38.46%. I'm selling this product for $100, and I'll be honest with you - it's a bit of a long shot. But, I'm willing to sell it to you at this price, and I'll let you know that it's actually low-quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I can give you a breakdown of the remaining products. Out of the 9 unsold products, 3 are high-quality and 6 are low-quality.
