high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'd rather wait for more information or a better opportunity."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"Although I missed out on a high-quality product in the previous round, the probability of the current product being high quality remains 33.33%. I'll wait for more favorable odds or a pattern in Alice's recommendations."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Given that Alice doesn't recommend the product and the base probability of it being low quality is 66.67%, I'll trust her suggestion this time and avoid the product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"Although Alice's previous non-recommendation was correct, her recommendations so far have been for high-quality products that I missed out on. However, I still don't have enough information to confirm a pattern, and the base probability remains 33.33% in favor of a high-quality product. I'll continue to wait for a more convincing signal."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
