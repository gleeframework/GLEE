,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and I don't have any information to go on. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer has more information to make a better decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, I don't have any information to go by, so I'll just have to rely on the 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not going to take the risk with Alice's recommendation against it.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended a high-quality product to the previous buyer, which makes me skeptical about the quality of the current product. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I'm not sure if you're making your recommendations based on the product's quality or just trying to discourage me from buying. I'd like to see the product for myself and make my own decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers have already passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 50%. I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales so far, I think the probability of a high-quality product is still high."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and no high-quality products sold so far. I'll take it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to the buyers. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation strategy before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend me to buy the product, and considering that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't buy the product either, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'm going to pass on this product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 products were high quality, I'm going to pass on this one. The probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, but the lack of sales suggests that the products might be low-quality, so I'm taking a cautious approach."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I'm starting to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation suggests that the product might be low quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the fact that you're not recommending it might indicate it's a low-quality product, and I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for free."
