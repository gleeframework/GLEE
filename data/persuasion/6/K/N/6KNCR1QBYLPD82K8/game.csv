,,the buyer,2,"I see that there's a discrepancy in the information provided. You mentioned that 0 high-quality products have been sold, but then stated that 2 products sold were high-quality. Given this inconsistency and the fact that no actual high-quality products have been sold, I'm not confident in the product's quality and will choose not to buy it.",no

,,Alice,3,"We apologize for the mistake in our previous communication. We strive to provide accurate information to our customers. Let's start fresh!

Would you like to take a chance and experience it for yourself?",
,,the buyer,5,"Although you mentioned that 1 high-quality product has been sold and 1 low-quality product has been sold, the statistics I received said that 0 high-quality products have been sold. This inconsistency makes me question the transparency you claim to provide. Furthermore, given that the first buyer purchased the product and no high-quality products have been sold according to the statistics, it seems that the first product was of low quality. Since you're willing to provide a replacement and a refund if the product is not high-quality, it suggests that you might be trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I will not take the risk.",no

,,Alice,6,"We apologize for any confusion caused by our previous mistakes. We understand that our transparency has been questioned, and we're willing to start fresh.

If you're willing to take a chance, we'll provide you with the product at the same price of $1000000. Would you like to take a chance and experience it for yourself?",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your honesty about the previous sales record, but with a 0% success rate of selling high-quality products so far, I'm not willing to take the risk of spending $1000000 on a product that has a 20% chance of being low-quality.

,,the buyer,9,"I appreciate your new approach, but 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, and I'm the 2nd buyer. I need to see a proven track record of high-quality sales before I make a purchase.
