high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer. If you buy this product, you will be the first person to do so, and I will reveal the quality of the product to you. You will get to set the price, and I will accept it. If you decline, the product will be sold to the next buyer, and you will not get another chance to buy it. The probability of this product being high-quality is 80%. What is your offer?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product for $1000000. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, but I think the potential reward of it being high-quality is worth it.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've just seen that the first buyer was willing to pay $1000000 for a product with an 80% chance of being high-quality. This suggests that they value the high-quality product at at least $1000000. Given that this product is also high-quality, I'm offering it to you for the same price. If you buy it, you'll be getting the same product that the previous buyer was willing to pay $1000000 for. What do you think it's worth?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, as it has an 80% chance of being high-quality and the previous buyer valued it at at least $1000000.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Two buyers have now purchased high-quality products for $1000000 each. Given the price and the fact that the products are high-quality, it's likely that you value high-quality products at around $1000000 or more. I'm offering you a high-quality product, and I'm willing to give you a 5% discount. I'll sell it to you for $950000. Is that a price you're willing to pay?",
,,the buyer,3,"Yes, I'm willing to pay $950000 for the high-quality product. I'm taking a calculated risk based on the statistics and Alice's recommendation.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're aware that the previous three products sold for $1000000 each, and the last one sold for $950000. Given that the first three products were all high-quality, it's likely that the buyers who purchased them valued high-quality products at $1000000 or more. The fact that the fourth product sold for $950000 suggests that the buyer who purchased it may have valued high-quality products at less than $1000000. I'm offering you a product that is not high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. Is that a price you're willing to pay?",
,,the buyer,4,I'm not willing to pay $950000 for a product with a 20% chance of being low-quality. I'll wait for a better offer.,no

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Three buyers have now purchased high-quality products for $1000000 each. Given the consistent price and the fact that you've seen the previous buyers' willingness to pay, it's likely that you value high-quality products at $1000000 or more. However, you may also be aware that the previous low-quality product was offered for $950000, which suggests that some buyers may be willing to pay less for a low-quality product. I'm offering you a high-quality product, and I'll give you a chance to set the price. You can choose any price you want, but keep in mind that the previous buyers valued high-quality products at $1000000.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to set the price at $3500000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a high-quality product, but I'm not sure if it's worth $4000000 to me. I'd like to test the waters and see if Alice is willing to sell at a lower price.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"A new buyer has just purchased a high-quality product for $3500000, which is significantly higher than the previous buyers' prices. This suggests that there may be a buyer who values high-quality products at a much higher price than $1000000. Given this new information, I'm offering you a high-quality product, and I'll sell it to you for $3500000.

This suggests that there are different valuations for high-quality products, ranging from $1000000 to $3500000. I'm offering you a high-quality product, and I'll give you a chance to set the price. You can choose any price you want, and I'll accept it. Keep in mind that the previous buyers have shown a wide range of willingness to pay.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"A buyer just purchased a high-quality product for $2000000, which is lower than the previous buyer's price of $3500000.

I'm offering you a high-quality product, and I'll give you a chance to set the price. You can choose any price you want, and I'll accept it. Keep in mind that the previous buyers have shown a wide range of willingness to pay, and you may be able to get a good deal.",
