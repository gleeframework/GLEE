Alice's message: I see what you're getting at. You want to know the probability based on the data you have, not what I've told you. Well, let me put it this way: you know that I've sold 2 out of 2 products that I've sold are high-quality, and you know that I've offered 4 products in total. That means that the probability of the next product being high-quality, based on the data you have, is 100% of the products I've sold, but only 50% of the products I've offered.

They were satisfied with the product and left a positive review. The third buyer was a skeptic who asked for even more data and context before making a decision.

Alice's message: I'm happy to provide more details about my quality control process. I'm using a Bayesian inference approach to estimate the quality of each product based on the feedback from previous buyers. I've developed a statistical model that takes into account the buyer's feedback, the product's characteristics, and other relevant factors to estimate the probability of a product being high-quality. If the buyer's feedback contradicts the results of my quality control checks, I take a closer look at the situation and may re-evaluate the product's quality. In some cases, I may also involve a third-party expert to review the product and provide an independent assessment.
