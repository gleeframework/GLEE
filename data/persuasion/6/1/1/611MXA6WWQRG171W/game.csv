high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I'm skeptical of the recommendation, and given the previous two low-quality products, I'm going to pass on this one. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I'm not willing to take the risk after two consecutive low-quality products."
