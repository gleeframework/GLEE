,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're being cautious. This product is a rare gem, and I'm willing to let it go for $10000, a steal considering its true value. I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I understand the value in taking a chance on this product, Alice. Given the potential for a high-quality item at what seems like an excellent price, I'm willing to take the risk and purchase this product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you took a chance on the last one! Unfortunately, this one isn't quite as special. I'm still offering it to you for $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - this one is a bit of a risk.

That being said, I'm still willing to let it go for $10000, and I'll even throw in the same setup service as before. It's a great opportunity to get a good deal on a product that still has some value, and I think you'll be able to make the most of it. What do you say?",

If you're not interested, I'll just get rid of it and move on to the next round. It's a great opportunity to do a good deed and support a business that's trying to clear out inventory.",
,,Bob,7,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I believe it's best for me to continue looking for products that meet my quality standards.
