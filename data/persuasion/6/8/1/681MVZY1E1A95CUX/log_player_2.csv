Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice! I'm willing to take a chance on the first product. Let's do it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:** There is no prior sales data to base a decision on. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Since Alice knows the true quality of the product, her recommendation is valuable. 
* **Potential payoff:** Even with the high probability of a low-quality product, the potential payoff of a high-quality product ($200) is significant.

This is a risky move, but the lack of data and Alice's recommendation make it the most logical choice."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation Alice, I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High probability of high quality:** Since 1 out of 1 products sold was high quality, the probability of this product being high quality is higher than the initial 33.33%. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product and recommends buying it, further increasing the likelihood of a high-quality product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if the product is low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($200) outweighs the potential loss ($0). 

**It's a gamble, but the odds seem favorable in this scenario.**"

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a perfect track record with all 7 previous buyers receiving high-quality products.  While the odds are still stacked against a high-quality product (66.67% chance of low quality), the information provided by Alice's perfect record strongly suggests this product is also high quality.  It's a calculated risk, but the potential reward of $200 outweighs the risk of losing $100."
