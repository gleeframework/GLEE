,,Alice,2,no,

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,"A high-quality product is available, which is a 50% chance. The previous buyer passed on the low-quality product, which is a good indicator of their cautious approach. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000."
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to decline the offer based on the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. Given the lack of information, I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy, and that means they likely got a low-quality product. This increases the probability of the current product being high-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,"We've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2, which is a 50% success rate. This suggests that the previous buyer's strategy of taking a risk after the first low-quality product was effective. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000."
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the current statistics, Alice has recommended 2 products and none of them were high quality. I'd like to pass on this one as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, I'm hoping that the third time's the charm and the product is high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is there a reason you're not recommending it based on the previous sales record?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"I'm glad you asked! I've been recommending based on the previous buyers' decisions, but I didn't have any information to go on. Now that we have a new product, I can confidently recommend it to you. We've sold 1 high-quality product out of 4 total products, and 0 high-quality products out of the first 2. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is 25% after the first 2, and 50% after the 4th product. Given this information, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be reliable."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying if the product is high quality. If it's low quality, I'll be disappointed, but I'll be glad that I didn't waste my money. I'm buying, but I'm not expecting much."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"Congratulations, you took a risk and it paid off! We've now sold 2 high-quality products out of 6 total products. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is now 33.33%. Given this new information, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows 5 sales with no high-quality products sold, which suggests a possible bias towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I understand your concerns, but let's look at the data objectively. We've sold 2 high-quality products out of 7 total products. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is now 28.57%. However, I'd like to point out that the last 2 products were high-quality, which suggests that the probability might be higher than that. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000."
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the number of high-quality products that have been sold out of the total number of products sold so far?
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"We've sold 3 high-quality products out of 9 total products. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is now 33.33%.

,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one. I'll wait for more information."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"We've sold 4 high-quality products out of 10 total products. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is now 40%. I'd like to point out that we've had 4 high-quality products in a row, which suggests that the probability might be even higher than that. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's not worth $1200000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you recommended against it. I'm hoping that this is a low-quality product and I'll get it for $1000000. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"We've sold 6 high-quality products out of 12 total products. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is now 50%. I'd like to point out that the last product was high-quality, and the previous buyer's decision to buy when I recommended against it was a good one. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice has a 0% success rate in recommending high-quality products to previous buyers, so I'm skeptical about the quality of this product."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm going to pass on this product. Given the previous 7 buyers didn't find the product worth buying, and Alice's recommendation, I'm leaning towards it being low quality. I'll wait for the next product."
