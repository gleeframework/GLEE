"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** You know the product is high-quality, which means it's worth $2,000,000 to the buyer. 
* **Price vs. Value:** The product is being sold for $1,000,000, which is significantly less than its actual value to the buyer. 
* **No Risk:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, so they are essentially taking a gamble with a 50% chance of doubling their investment. 

Since the buyer is guaranteed a profit of $1,000,000 if they buy the high-quality product, it is highly recommended to buy."

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:**  The product is again high-quality, offering a guaranteed profit of $1,000,000.
* **No Sales History:**  While there's no sales history to influence the buyer, the situation is identical to the first round. The buyer still faces a 50/50 chance, with a potential for substantial gain.

It's important to remember that the buyer's decision in the previous round doesn't change the value of the product in this round.  It's a new opportunity with the same potential for profit."
