,,Alice,1,"This product is a low-quality item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'll be transparent with you, but I want to make it clear that I have 20 chances to offer you a high-quality product, and this is not it. If you're willing to take a risk, I'll give you a chance to buy this one for a discounted price of $750000. This is the only discount I can offer, and it's a one-time deal.",

However, I want to make it clear that I'm not going to offer any discounts, even if it's a high-quality product. You've already seen the value of one high-quality product, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with this one as well. The price remains at $1000000. Are you ready to make another great deal?",

As I mentioned earlier, the probability of getting a low-quality product is 66.67%. This one is indeed low-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that's significantly lower than the previous two products. I'll offer it to you for $250000. It's a steal, considering the original price is $1000000.

I'm not making any profit on this one, and I just want to get it off my hands. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",
