I'm offering this product to you for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product is still higher than the overall probability, and I'm being transparent about the possibility of low-quality items. Would you like to take a chance on this product?",
,,the buyer,12,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9500. I understand that the probability of it being high-quality is 54.55%, but I'm trying to account for the possibility of it being low-quality.",yes
