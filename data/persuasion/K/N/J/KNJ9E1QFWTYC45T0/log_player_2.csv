Alice's message: I understand your skepticism about the guarantee, and I appreciate your diligence in researching our sales record. To answer your question, there have been 2 potential buyers so far, and 1 product has been sold (the low-quality one from Round 1). The proportion of high-quality products sold is 0% (0/1). However, I'd like to point out that this is an anomaly, and I expect the proportion of high-quality products to increase as we move forward. This product, for instance, is high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $10000, a price that reflects its value. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm willing to offer a discount of 50% off the price, making it $5000.
