high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it seems like the current product is more likely to be low-quality. I would like to pass on this product."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know why you're recommending not to buy it. Is it because you think it's low quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, as Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality but rather on her own strategy, and I'm willing to take the risk of potentially getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Could you provide that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous 4 buyers have all passed on the products, suggesting a high proportion of low-quality products, or is it based on some other factor?"

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation.
