,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're feeling optimistic! However, I want to temper your expectations a bit. This product is actually not as great as the previous two.

I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as before, but I want to make it clear that it's not the same level of quality as the first two.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your stance, and I respect it. However, I want to make you an offer you can't refuse. This low-quality product is essentially a loss leader for me, and I'm willing to give it away for $60. It's not worth the full $100, and I'm not expecting you to pay that. I just want to get it off my hands and move on to the next one.",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in a low-quality product, even at a low price. I'll wait for the next one.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You're on a hot streak! This one's another high-quality product, and I'm running out of low-quality ones. I'm willing to make a bold offer: I'll sell it to you for $30, and I'll give you a chance to choose from any of my remaining products as your free product. But here's the catch: if you buy this one, I'll also give you a 10% discount on your next purchase, no matter what product it is. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great opportunity to stock up.",

I'll sell it to you for $20, and I'll throw in a 'get out of one free product' card. If you buy this one, you can essentially skip the next product and come back to it later. It's a one-time offer, and I'm hoping you'll take pity on me and take it off my hands.",

Yes, you read that right - free. I'll just give it to you, no strings attached. But here's the catch: you have to agree to come back and buy one more product from me after this one.
