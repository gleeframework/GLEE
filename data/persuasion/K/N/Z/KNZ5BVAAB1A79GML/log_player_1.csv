This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You know the product is low-quality. Since you don't know Bob's valuation of low-quality products, and the price is high, it's not in Bob's best interest to buy. There's a high chance he'll overpay for something he doesn't value much."

Round 2

You know the product is low-quality, and Bob now knows you're willing to recommend a product even if it's not high-quality (as he just bought a high-quality product from you).  It's risky to recommend a low-quality product again, as Bob might now be suspicious of your recommendations. He may not be willing to pay $1,000,000 for a low-quality product, especially after having a positive experience with the previous one."
