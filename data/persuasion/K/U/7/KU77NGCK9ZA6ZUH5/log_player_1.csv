The total value of the accessory is indeed $2,000, and it's a great addition to the product. However, I want to be upfront with you: the accessory is not a separate item, but rather a bundle that comes with the product. If you buy the product, you'll get the entire bundle, regardless of the product's quality. I'll sell it to you for the standard price of $10,000.
