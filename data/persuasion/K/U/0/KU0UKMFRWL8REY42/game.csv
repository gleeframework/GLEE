,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you provide that information? I'd also like to know if there's any information about the previous buyer's decision and the product's quality."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.

I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for a more informed decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers, including those who received a recommendation to buy, ended up with a low-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers were able to get a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous sales record, which shows that all 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality.
