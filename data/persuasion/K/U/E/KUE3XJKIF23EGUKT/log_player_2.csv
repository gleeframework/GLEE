**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** There's limited information about the quality of the products. We only know that 1 out of 1 sold products was high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation is a valuable signal, as she has information about the product's quality that we don't. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a 50% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0).

**It's a calculated risk, but given Alice's recommendation, buying seems like the better strategy.**"
