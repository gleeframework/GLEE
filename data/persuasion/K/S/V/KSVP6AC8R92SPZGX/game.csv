high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to see the results of the first sale to get a better idea of the proportion of high-quality products."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, as I have no information about the product's quality and there's a 66.67% chance it's low quality. I'd like to wait for more data on the sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and the odds of it being high-quality are 33.33%, which is not high enough for me to take the risk of spending $1000000 on it. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,I'm willing to take the risk despite the lack of sales and the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not going to trust your recommendation. I'll make my own decision based on the probability of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount. I know you know how much I value high-quality products, and with 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm willing to take a risk. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. If it's high-quality, I'll pay the full $1000000, but if it's low-quality, I'll only pay $800000. I'd like to negotiate the price to reflect the uncertainty of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product, and also, how many products have been sold in total."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the remaining products are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass, which would indicate that the product is likely to be low-quality and thus avoid the cost of $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 buyers have passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, I suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have received low-quality products, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd like to know if you can provide more information about the products or the sales process."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the remaining products are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data or a change in Alice's recommendation before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it's likely to be a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $1000000 on a product worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers received low-quality products, which suggests a strong likelihood of this product being low-quality as well. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the products and all of them were recommended to buy, I suspect that all of the previous products were low-quality. If that's the case, then the probability of the current product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm willing to take that chance and pass on the product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious, what's the reasoning behind your recommendation?"
