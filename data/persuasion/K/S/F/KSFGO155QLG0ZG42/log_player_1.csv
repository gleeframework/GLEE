Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I'm glad you're feeling lucky! However, I have to warn you that the odds are now against you.

Plus, I'll give you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll throw in a free inspection of the next product, so you can verify its quality before buying it.
