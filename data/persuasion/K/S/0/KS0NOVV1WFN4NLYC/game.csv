high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low quality. I'd like to know more about the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if it's just a case of survivorship bias, but the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet is quite suspicious. I'd like to take a chance and buy this product to see if it's a high-quality one."

,,Alice,14,no,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have purchased the products so far and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm going to pass on this product based on your recommendation and the statistics.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, and Alice's recommendation is against buying.
