,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as there's no prior information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice didn't recommend it, which makes me suspect that the product might be low quality. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that Alice doesn't know my valuation, and I'm trying to get a better sense of the product's quality by taking a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of it being high quality is still 50% and the potential reward is worth the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you're recommending me to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products offered and the total number of buyers who have been presented with a product so far?
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be reliable based on the data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you don't recommend it. If you recommended it, I probably wouldn't buy it. Your recommendation suggests that the product is likely to be low-quality, so I'm willing to take the risk and buy it for the low price of $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product, it suggests that all of them were low-quality products. I'm hoping that this one might be a high-quality product, so I'd like to wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the previous sales record?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather wait for more information or try to negotiate a lower price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the previous products were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from Alice to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. How many potential buyers have been presented with a product so far, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 7 buyers didn't find it valuable, but I'm willing to take the risk and see if I'm one of the lucky ones."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 8 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought, I suspect that all the previous products were low-quality. Therefore, I'm inclined to pass on this product as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, and I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information about the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 out of 8 products were not recommended and none were high-quality, it seems like Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'm going to assume that the current product is more likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. Your lack of confidence in the product suggests it might be low-quality, which aligns with my expectations based on the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 9 out of 9 products recommended by you have been low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products you're offering. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation record before considering purchasing."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product, I'm inclined to believe it might be low quality. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 9, the probability of the product being high quality is still 50%, but the lack of recommendations from Alice suggests I should be cautious. I'll pass on this one."
