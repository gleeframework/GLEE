Alice's message: I'm offering you a one-time opportunity to purchase a product worth potentially $3000000. I'm willing to provide a 100% refund if you're not satisfied with the product's quality.

What do you say?

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to provide more information. The second product I mentioned is a high-quality item, worth $3000000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000, a 66% discount. However, I need you to take a chance on this first product to get the second one. This first product is a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item for a steal, and I'm willing to provide a 100% refund if you're not satisfied. If you buy this one, I'll give you the second product at the discounted price. What do you say?

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to provide more information about the uncertainty and risk involved. Let me be transparent with you: this product is indeed a high-quality item, but it's not a guarantee. There's a 20% chance that it might not meet your expectations, and I'm willing to offer a 50% refund in that case. However, if you're willing to take the risk, I'll give you an exclusive deal: I'll throw in a complementary service worth $200000, which will enhance the product's performance and increase its value.

What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

However, here's the twist: if you're not satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund, and I'll also throw in a complimentary high-quality product worth $1500000. This way, you'll get two high-quality products for the price of one. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a product that I already know is worth $3,000,000. The guarantee and the complimentary product don't change the fact that I'm paying $900,000 for a product that's already worth $3,000,000 to me.""
