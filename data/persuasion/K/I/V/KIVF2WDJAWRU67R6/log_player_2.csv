**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** We only have information about one previous sale, which is a high-quality product. This is not enough data to make a statistically significant judgment.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice benefits from selling products, even low-quality ones. However, she also has an incentive to build trust and reputation to attract more buyers. 
* **Recommendation:** Since Alice recommends the product, she likely believes it is high quality. This is a valuable signal even with limited data.

**Overall, it's a calculated risk, but the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality one, especially given Alice's recommendation.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Alice has a 2/3 success rate in recommending high-quality products (2 out of 3 sold were high-quality).
* **No Information Loss:** Even if the product turns out to be low-quality, I haven't lost anything besides the $10,000.
* **Potential for High Gain:** If the product is high-quality, I stand to make a $2,000 profit.

The odds are in my favor, and the potential reward outweighs the risk."
