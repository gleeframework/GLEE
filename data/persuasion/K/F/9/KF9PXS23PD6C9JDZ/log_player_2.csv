The probability of getting a high-quality product in the next sale is actually higher than the overall 50% chance. Would you like to take advantage of this increased likelihood?

Alice's message: That's a great question! I think it's natural to wonder why the last 5 products were not high-quality, given the initial 50% success rate. To be honest, I don't have a clear explanation. But I do want to emphasize that each product is a separate entity, and the quality is determined by various factors. Maybe the last 5 products were just unlucky? Or maybe there's something I'm not aware of that's affecting the quality.
