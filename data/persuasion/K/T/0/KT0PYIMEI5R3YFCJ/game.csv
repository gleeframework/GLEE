high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to see the statistics on the product quality before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take a chance, I'm the first buyer, and I don't have any information to go on. I'll take the product and hope for the best!"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and ended up not purchasing, it seems like the product is likely low quality. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't think the recommendation is reliable with only one sale and no high-quality products sold yet."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd rather wait for more information or consider the next product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm going to buy it, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced by the statistics yet, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products to buyers who don't have access to the sales record. I'd like to see more data on the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when I can potentially get a high-quality one for the same price later."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were low-quality, I believe the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is higher than 80%. I will pass on this product to see if it is high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 buyers have passed on the products and 0 high-quality products have been sold, I think the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous two buyers also received a recommendation to buy and neither of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to buyers, so I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you tell me the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far?
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to know the current proportion of low-quality products in the remaining pool before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that Alice's previous recommendations were based on low-quality products and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both chose to pass, I'm suspicious that the products they were offered were low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
