A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **No information to the contrary:**  Alice has no way to know the buyer's valuation of low-quality products. Since all previous products were high-quality, the buyer has no reason to suspect the current product is different.
* **Maintaining a positive track record:** Even with a low-quality product, recommending it keeps Alice's track record of selling high-quality products intact. This could be crucial for future sales. 
* **Risk of losing future sales:**  If Alice starts refusing to sell products due to an unknown quality, the buyers will be hesitant to purchase from her in the future, even when the product is genuinely high-quality. 

This strategy is based on the assumption that buyers will be more likely to purchase from a seller with a consistent track record, even if there is a chance of getting a low-quality product."
