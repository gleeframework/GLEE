If it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and we can start fresh. But if it's high-quality, you'll get the product at the usual price of $100. What do you think?""
}"

This way, you'll have a lower risk if the product is low-quality, but you'll still get the product at the usual price of $100 if it's high-quality. What do you think?""
