,,Alice,1,"I have a product worth $4000000 to you, but I'm only asking for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. If you're interested, I can offer you a 10-year warranty and a 100% satisfaction guarantee. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not convinced yet, I'd like to see more products before making a decision.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. I'm willing to offer you a second chance to acquire a high-quality product at the same price of $1000000. However, I'd like to provide you with some additional information to alleviate your concerns. I'm willing to reveal the quality of this product to you after you make a decision. If you buy it and it's indeed high-quality, I'll give you a bonus of $200000 on top of the original price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for a chance to get a high-quality product and the potential bonus.,yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Congratulations on making a great decision earlier, Bob! You got a high-quality product and the bonus. As you know, the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. Now, I'd like to offer you a new product, which is also worth $4000000 to you. However, I'm willing to offer you a 50/50 split on the price if you're willing to take on the risk of it being a low-quality product. If it's high-quality, you'll pay $1000000, but if it's low-quality, you'll only pay $500000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,I'll take the 50/50 split offer. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product for the potential to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Unfortunately, this product is a low-quality one, Bob. You only paid $500000 for it, which is a great deal considering its actual value is $0. I want to reassure you that this is an isolated incident, and the probability of a product being high-quality remains 80%. I'm willing to offer you a new product at the same 50/50 split price of $500000. However, this time, I'll give you a unique opportunity to 'lock in' the price of the next product at $1000000, regardless of its quality, if you buy this one. If you buy this low-quality product, you'll have the option to lock in the price of the next product at $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll buy the current low-quality product for $500000. I'll take the opportunity to lock in the price of the next product at $1000000, hoping to get a high-quality product in the next round.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Great decision, Bob! You locked in the price of the next product at $1000000, and now you have a chance to get a high-quality product at that price. I'll remind you that this product is indeed high-quality, worth $4000000 to you. With the price locked in, you can now take advantage of a great deal. I'll also throw in a 5-year warranty and a premium support package, which is usually worth $200000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,I'll take the high-quality product at the locked-in price of $1000000. I'm excited to get a valuable product at a discounted price and appreciate the added bonuses of the 5-year warranty and premium support package.,yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Excellent choice, Bob! You're on a roll! Now, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at the locked-in price of $1000000, just like before. However, this time, I'll also give you a chance to'steal' a high-quality product at the same price if you're willing to take a slight risk. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll get it at the locked-in price. But, if it's low-quality, you'll get to'steal' a high-quality product from a future round, at the same price of $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the risk and buy the current product. I'm willing to take a chance to get a high-quality product at the locked-in price, and if it's low-quality, I'll try to steal a high-quality product from a future round.",yes

,,Alice,7,"You're a bold one, Bob! You took the risk and it paid off. This product is indeed high-quality, worth $4000000 to you. You got it at the locked-in price of $1000000, and you also get to keep the 5-year warranty and premium support package. Now, I'll offer you a new product, which is also high-quality. However, I'll give you a chance to 'trade up' to a better product from a future round, if you're willing to pay a small premium. If you buy this product, you'll get a 10-year warranty and a 150% satisfaction guarantee, but you'll also have the option to trade up to a better product from a future round for a small additional fee. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,I'm not sure about the trade-up option. I'd like to see more information about the potential trade-up products before making a decision. Can you give me more details about the products I could trade up to?,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"No problem, Bob. I'll give you a sneak peek at the potential trade-up products. If you buy this low-quality product for $1000000, you'll get to choose from a selection of high-quality products from future rounds, including a product worth $5000000, a product worth $3500000, and a product worth $3000000. You can choose any of these products at the locked-in price of $1000000, or you can stick with the current product and its associated warranty and support. What do you say?",

However, I'll give you a special offer: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 'wildcard' that allows you to choose any high-quality product from the next 5 rounds, at the locked-in price of $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take the low-quality product for $1000000. The wildcard offer is too good to pass up, and I'm willing to take the risk in hopes of getting a high-quality product from one of the next 5 rounds.",yes

I'll remind you that you can still use the wildcard to choose a high-quality product from the next 4 rounds. However, I'll give you an exclusive offer: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a 'priority pass' to the next round, allowing you to skip the current product and go straight to the next one. You'll essentially get a chance to get the best product from the next round, without having to wait. What do you say?",

,,Alice,12,"You're really maximizing your opportunities, Bob! You've got the wildcard, the best warranty and support package, and now the priority pass. I'll remind you that you can use the priority pass to get the best product from the next round. However, I'll give you an even sweeter deal: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a 'golden ticket' that allows you to choose any product from the next 3 rounds, at the locked-in price of $1000000. You'll essentially get three chances to get the best product from the next 3 rounds, without having to wait. What do you say?",

However, I'll give you an additional offer: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a 'double-or-nothing' option. If you use the golden ticket to choose a better product from the next round, I'll give you a 200% refund on this product, essentially making it a free product.
