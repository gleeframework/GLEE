,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not going to take the risk, based on the statistics, it seems like the product is likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm the third buyer, and the fact that you've recommended against it might make me more likely to buy it, as it could be a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Given that 3 out of 3 buyers have passed on the product, I'm assuming the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given that 3 buyers have passed on it."

,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the probability of the product being high quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous buyers didn't buy the product, or is there something specific about this product that you're concerned about?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 products were high quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd like to pass on it to see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products since 4 out of 4 previous buyers bought the products despite the 2/3 chance of them being low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 products were high-quality, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
