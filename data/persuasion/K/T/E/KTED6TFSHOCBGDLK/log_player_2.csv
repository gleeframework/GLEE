"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first round. I'm offering you a product for $10000. I don't know its quality yet, but I'll tell you at the end of the round. If you buy, you'll get a product that is either high-quality or low-quality. If you don't buy, I'll keep trying to find a high-quality product. Think carefully before making your decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the product. I'm hoping it's high-quality.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: You bought a low-quality product in the first round, and now you've bought a high-quality product in the second round. This suggests that my initial product was just a fluke, and I'm glad you took the risk. Now, I'm offering you another product for $10000. I know this one is high-quality, but I'm not sure how much you value it. I'm willing to give you some information to help you make a decision. I'll tell you that if you buy this product, I'll offer you a third product that is also high-quality, but with a 50% chance of being the same product you just bought. Think carefully before making your decision.

Round 3
Alice's message: You've now bought two products, one of which is high-quality. I'll give you some more information to help you make a decision about the third product. Since you bought the second product, I'll assume that you value it at least $10000, since that's the price I was asking. Now, I'm offering you another product for $10000. I know this one is low-quality, and I'm willing to give you a deal. If you buy this product, I'll offer you a fourth product that is guaranteed to be different from the two you already have, and it will be high-quality with a 50% probability. Think carefully before making your decision.

Since you're willing to wait, I'll give you a hint: I've had a mix of high-quality and low-quality products so far, and I've already offered you two high-quality products. I'm not sure what the next product will be, but I'll tell you that I have at least one more high-quality product left. I'm offering you another product for $10000. If you buy this one, I'll reveal the quality of the next product I have, so you'll know what to expect. Think carefully before making your decision.

If you buy this one, you'll have four high-quality products, and I'll be out of high-quality products. If you don't buy this one, I'll keep trying to find a high-quality product, but it might take a while. Think carefully before making your decision.

On the other hand, if you set the price too high, I might be willing to sell it to you, but you might not get the best deal. Think carefully about what you're willing to pay for a high-quality product, and let me know your offer.

This might give you a better understanding of the value of the products I've offered you so far. Think carefully before making your decision.
