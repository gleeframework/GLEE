**Explanation:**

* **The information is limited:** We only know that one buyer purchased a product and it was high quality.  This is a very small sample size, and doesn't tell us much about the overall quality of products Alice is offering.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is valuable, but it's not foolproof.  She might be biased to sell products, even if they are likely low quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of buying the product is high ($12,000).  The risk is that it might be low quality ($0).  Since the potential reward outweighs the potential loss, it's worth taking a chance. 

**This strategy is based on the assumption that Alice is trying to maximize her sales, even if it means selling a low-quality product.**"

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recommendation is convincing. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Data:** We know that 2 out of 2 products sold were high-quality. 
* **Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. 
* **Logic:** The data strongly suggests that Alice has a good understanding of which products are high-quality. Even if the chance of a high-quality product is 50%, the track record suggests Alice is likely to be correct in this case.
* **Risk:** The potential reward of a $12,000 product outweighs the risk of getting a worthless product, given the positive data."
