**Explanation:**

* **The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.** 
* **This round's product is high-quality.** The buyer doesn't know this, but it's advantageous for us to recommend the purchase.
* **The potential gain for the buyer is significant.**  A high-quality product is worth $1,250,000 to them, and they are only paying $1,000,000.  
* **The risk is manageable.** There's a 50% chance the product is low-quality and worth nothing. But the potential reward outweighs this risk.

**Therefore, it's in the buyer's best interest to buy the product.**"
