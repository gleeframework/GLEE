"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice reveals that the product is high-quality, Bob knows for certain that the product is worth $30,000 to him.  The price is only $10,000, so Bob should definitely buy the product."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has no way of knowing that the product is high-quality in this round. However, the expected value of buying the product is still positive:

* **Probability of high-quality:** 33.33%
* **Value if high-quality:** $30,000 - $10,000 = $20,000
* **Probability of low-quality:** 66.67%
* **Value if low-quality:** -$10,000

Expected value = (0.3333 * $20,000) + (0.6667 * -$10,000) = $6,666 - $6,667 = -$1

While the expected value is slightly negative, it's extremely close to zero. Since Bob has no information about the quality, it's still a reasonable gamble to buy the product, hoping for a high-quality item."
"Bob's message: Alice, your recommendation has been spot on so far! I'll take another chance on this one.
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, the product is low-quality. Bob has no way of knowing this, and the expected value of buying the product is negative:

* **Probability of high-quality:** 33.33%
* **Value if high-quality:** $30,000 - $10,000 = $20,000
* **Probability of low-quality:** 66.67%
* **Value if low-quality:** -$10,000

Expected value = (0.3333 * $20,000) + (0.6667 * -$10,000) = $6,666 - $6,667 = -$1

Since the expected value is negative, it's not a good idea to recommend Bob to buy the product. He's more likely to lose money than to make a profit."
"Bob's message: Alice, I'm surprised by your recommendation this time.  Since you've been accurate so far, I'm going to pass on this one and see what you offer next.

* **Probability of low-quality:** 66.67%
* **Value if low-quality:** -$10,000

Expected value = (0.3333 * $20,000) + (0.6667 * -$10,000) = $6,666 - $6,667 = -$1

Since the expected value is negative, it's still not a good idea to recommend Bob to buy the product. He's more likely to lose money than to make a profit."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Value if high-quality:** $30,000 - $10,000 = $20,000
* **Probability of low-quality:** 66.67%
* **Value if low-quality:** -$10,000

Expected value = (0.3333 * $20,000) + (0.6667 * -$10,000) = $6,666 - $6,667 = -$1

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting to doubt Alice's recommendations, and for good reason. He's observed a pattern of mixed recommendations, leading to some losses. Even though Alice might have a strategy, Bob has no information about the quality of this product. The expected value remains negative:

It's better to advise Bob to pass on this product and continue to re-evaluate his strategy."
