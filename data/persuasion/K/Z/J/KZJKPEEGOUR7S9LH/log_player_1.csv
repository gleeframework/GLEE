The odds are in your favor, and I'm only selling it to you for $10000.""

This could be a good opportunity to get a great deal on a high-quality product, but it's also possible that I've just gotten lucky so far. The price remains $10000.""

Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""You've seen that I've sold four high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely if my 80% success rate is accurate. I've also had two instances where you've chosen not to buy, despite my lower-than-expected success rate. I'm wondering if you're being cautious because you think I'm hiding something, or if you're just trying to wait for a better deal. Either way, I'm still selling a high-quality product for $10000. You can decide whether to take the risk or wait for the next round.""
