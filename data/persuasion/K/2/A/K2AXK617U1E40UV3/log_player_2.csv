Alice's message: Welcome to the next round! I know you're eager to make a decision. Let me give you a little insight: since the previous buyer got a high-quality product, the probability of the next product being high-quality just decreased. With 1 out of 3 products being high-quality overall, and 1 out of 2 products being low-quality in the last round, the probability of this product being high-quality is now around 25%.

Alice's message: I understand your request! As for the distribution of the 5 high-quality products sold so far, I can tell you that they're not randomly distributed throughout the sales. In fact, there's a pattern. The high-quality products tend to cluster together, with 3 high-quality products sold in the first 5 rounds, and then 2 high-quality products sold in the next 4 rounds. This pattern suggests that there might be a underlying structure to the product distribution, and it's possible that the next product might be high-quality as well. However, I want to make it clear that this is just an observation, and there's no guarantee that the next product will be high-quality.
