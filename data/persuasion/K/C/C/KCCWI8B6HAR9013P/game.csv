high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 products, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is 0. Based on the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I would expect to see at least 1 high-quality product sold by now. Since I don't see any high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to think that the products being sold are low-quality. Therefore, I'd like to pass on the product."

,,Alice,19,yes,
