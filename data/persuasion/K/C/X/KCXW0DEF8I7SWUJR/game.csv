,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, as there's no prior data to go by. I'm willing to take the initial hit to get the first data point."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the lack of sold high-quality products might indicate that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality, but there's still a 33.33% chance of it being high-quality, which is worth the risk to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not taking your recommendation into account. I'll decide based on the probability of the product being high-quality and my personal valuation."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations and the lack of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous 5 buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than the overall average. I'd like to wait for the next product or get more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low-quality, and I don't want to waste $1000000 on a product that's not worth it."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. It seems that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought, which suggests that all previous products were low quality."

,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have already passed on the product, and none of the sold products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%).
