"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has revealed the product is high-quality, it is definitely worth buying for Bob. The product is worth $1,200,000 to him, and he can buy it for $1,000,000, resulting in a profit of $200,000."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob doesn't know the quality of this product, he knows the product is equally likely to be high-quality or low-quality. 

* **If it's high-quality:** Bob gains $200,000 profit ($1,200,000 value - $1,000,000 price)
* **If it's low-quality:** Bob loses $1,000,000 

Since the potential gain is higher than the potential loss, and both scenarios are equally likely, it's still in Bob's best interest to buy the product."
