,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm not sure what to make of your recommendation, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to pay the price of $1000000 for it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a risk-taker and I'm willing to take the chance that it might be a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm aware that the odds are against me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to know how many total products have been offered and how many high-quality products have been offered, if any."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. However, since 3 out of 3 buyers have bought the product, it's likely that the products being sold are low-quality. I will pass on the product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous buyers have received high-quality products. I'd like to wait and see if the pattern holds or if the next product will be high quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your decision-making process?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know your reasoning behind not recommending it. Is there a particular reason you think it's low quality?"

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. Since no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any information about the product's quality, and the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the product despite no high-quality products being sold suggests that the products sold so far were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a more informative signal before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I think it's likely that the product is low quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but can I ask, what was the quality of the previous 4 products that were purchased?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from you to make a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, and I'm not getting any useful information from her.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is likely lower than 50%, so I'll pass on this opportunity."
