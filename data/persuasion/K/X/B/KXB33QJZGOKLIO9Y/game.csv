low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so with the understanding that I'm not relying on your recommendation, and I'm making a decision based on the uncertainty of the product's quality and my own valuation of it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the previous sales record or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. This is my first intuition, and I'm not basing my decision on any statistics. I want to see if the product is high-quality or low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product to get more information about the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can tell me the probability that the product is high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're advising me not to buy it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you didn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that you don't know my valuation, and the fact that there have been 5 previous buyers who all passed on the product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0, which is consistent with the probability of 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping to get the high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that since you don't recommend it, it might be a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers bought the products, and considering the low success rate of high-quality products being sold, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious about the true quality of the product and Alice's recommendation pattern. I'm not relying on her recommendation to make my decision, but rather my own analysis of the data."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics. With 7 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it's likely that the products are mostly low quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not buying based on your previous recommendations, which seem to be accurate, but I'd like to understand the reasoning behind them. Are you implying that the product is low quality? If so, I'd like to know the basis for your assessment."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the previous 7 sales?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the current product. I'd like to pass on it and see if Alice's recommendation changes."

,,Alice,18,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 out of 7 products have been low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is also low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product, which might have a higher chance of being high-quality."
