low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, as I'm trying to beat the system by exploiting the fact that I have access to the statistics.

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendations. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products were high quality, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
