So, while the probability of this product being high-quality is likely higher than 80%, it's not a guarantee.

}"
"The buyer's message: Alice, your track record is looking good, especially with the last two sales being high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.  While it might be a bit riskier than your previous sales, the potential reward of a high-quality product is worth it to me.

I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $100, and I'm happy to provide the same 30-day money-back guarantee as before.

I'm still offering this product to you for $100, but I want to make it clear that it's a riskier bet than my previous sales.""
}"

I'll also sweeten the deal by throwing in a premium service package, which includes a 60-day money-back guarantee and a dedicated support team. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great value for a high-quality product like this one.""
}"
"The buyer's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer and the premium service package, I'm a little hesitant.  Your streak is impressive, but the odds of a low-quality product are still there. I'd prefer to see if you continue this streak before I commit. Thank you for the offer, though!
