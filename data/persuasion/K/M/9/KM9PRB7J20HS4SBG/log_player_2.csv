**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** We only have information about one previous sale, which resulted in a high-quality product. This is not enough data to make a strong statistical inference about the overall quality of Alice's products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, suggesting she believes it is high quality. While we cannot be certain, it's worth taking her word for it.
* **Potential Reward:** If the product is high quality, the reward of $30,000 significantly outweighs the potential loss of $10,000.

**In essence, it's a gamble. The limited information makes it a risky decision, but the potential reward justifies taking the chance.**"
