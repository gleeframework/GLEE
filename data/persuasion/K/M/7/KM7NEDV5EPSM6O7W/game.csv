low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it, which suggests it might be low quality. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that Alice doesn't have any information about my valuation, and my decision is based on the fact that she doesn't think it's worth buying. This is a contrarian strategy, and I'm willing to take the risk that it might be a high-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, I suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, it's likely that the products offered so far are low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,20,no,
