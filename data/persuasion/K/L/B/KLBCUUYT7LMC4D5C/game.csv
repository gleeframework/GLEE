,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I want to assure you that I have sold 0 high-quality products out of 0 total products so far, but I'm hoping this one will be the start of a great streak. Would you like to take a chance on this product?",

,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second product! I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 1 total product so far, and you've seen that the first product was indeed high-quality. I'd like to point out that this is a very unusual situation, and I'm not sure what to make of it. I'm willing to sell this second product to you for $1000000. Would you like to take a chance on it?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take it, but I'm aware of the unusual situation and the low probability of it being high-quality given the previous product was high-quality.",yes

,,Alice,3,"Welcome to the third product! I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products so far, and the last one was low-quality. I'd like to assure you that this is a completely random outcome, and I'm not trying to mislead you in any way. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000. Would you like to take a chance on it?",

,,Alice,4,"Welcome to the fourth product! I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far. I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality has increased slightly, and I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000. I'd also like to mention that the features of this product are top-notch, and it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a fixed price. Would you like to take a chance on it?",

,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the current sales record. Given that 2 high-quality products were sold out of 4 total products, can you tell me the probability of a product being high-quality?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Welcome to the sixth product! I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 total products so far. I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality has changed, and it's now 40% (2 high-quality products out of 5 total products). I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product is still lower than the overall probability, but it's a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fixed price. Would you like to take a chance on it?",

I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the law of large numbers is still at play, and the probability of a product being high-quality will continue to converge towards the true probability of 33.33%. I'm also willing to offer you a gentle reminder that I'm not trying to hide any information from you, and I'm being transparent about my sales record. Would you like to take a chance on it?",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate your transparency about the sales record, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the law of large numbers has converged yet, and I'm worried that the true probability of a high-quality product is still closer to 33.33% than 42.86%.
