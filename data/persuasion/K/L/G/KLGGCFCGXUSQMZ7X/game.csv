This one is a best-seller among our customers, and I'm confident you'll be equally satisfied with it. However, I want to be transparent with you - our previous conversation has already given you a hint about the quality of our products. I'm offering you a chance to buy this one at the same price as the last one, but I want to make it clear that this product might not be as exciting as the first one. It's still a great item, but it's not a game-changer like the previous one. What do you think?",

,,Alice,8,"I understand your preference to see the next product first. As it happens, I have a different product for you today. I want to be upfront with you - this product is not one of our top-of-the-line items. It's a more basic model that still gets the job done, but it's not as advanced as our premium products. I'm offering it to you at the same price of $100, but I want to be clear that it's not the best value for the price.

I'm offering it to you at the same price of $100, but I want to be clear that it's not a good value for the price.
