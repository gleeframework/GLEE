,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait and see if any more information becomes available before making a decision."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to be cautious and pass on this one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you don't recommend it, which suggests there's a higher chance it's low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $1000000, which would be a good deal for me."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products and none have been sold, I'm suspicious that all the products so far have been low-quality. If that's the case, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 50.00%. However, if the previous products were all low-quality, then the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50.00% because the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products would be higher. Therefore, I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass.
