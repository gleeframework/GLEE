This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since this is the last round, I'll make a final recommendation.

 Out of 10 products, 2 have been sold, and 1 of them was high-quality. The proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/10 or 10%.

However, considering the fact that the first 5 products were all low-quality, and the last 2 products were 1 high-quality and 1 low-quality, it's possible that the high-quality products are concentrated in the later products.

Given this information, I'll recommend the buyer to buy the product.
