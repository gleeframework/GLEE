,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that it's high-quality based on the previous sales data. With 2 low-quality products sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality as well.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, and given the statistics, I'm going to assume that the product is likely to be low quality. Since there have been 3 previous sales with no high-quality products sold, it's reasonable to infer that the probability of a product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on the product to avoid the loss."
