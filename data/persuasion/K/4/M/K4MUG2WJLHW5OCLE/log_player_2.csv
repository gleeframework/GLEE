Alice's message: I've sold 3 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. You can see that the ratio of high-quality to total products sold is 1:3, which is exactly the probability I mentioned at the beginning. This suggests that my initial claim was accurate, and the probability of getting a high-quality product is indeed 33.33%. I'm not trying to sway your decision, but I think it's worth considering the odds. The price is still $10000, and you'll be saving $2000 if you get a high-quality product. What do you think?
