Alice's message: I understand your concerns from the previous buyer, but I must clarify that my pricing is non-negotiable. The price remains at $1000000.

If you're willing to take the risk, I'll tell you that the previous product was low-quality. This might give you a better understanding of the odds.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the probability! Given that the first 6 buyers were randomly selected, and the last 3 products were high-quality, we can use Bayes' theorem to update the probability. The probability of a high-quality product being selected for the 7th buyer, given that the last 3 products were high-quality, is approximately 66.67% (3/4).
