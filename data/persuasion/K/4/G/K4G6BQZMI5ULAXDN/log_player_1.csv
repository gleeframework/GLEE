Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Bob is rational:**  He knows the product is either high-quality (worth $1,200,000) or low-quality (worth $0). 
* **The price is fixed:** At $1,000,000, he's guaranteed to lose money if he buys a low-quality product.
* **No information is given:** You haven't provided any reason for Bob to believe this particular product is high-quality.  

Since there's no information to suggest the product is high-quality, Bob can't justify the risk of losing $1,000,000."
