high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'll pass on this one, but I'm curious about the quality of the product. Could you tell me if it was high or low quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'll pass on this one as well. Given that the last one was high-quality, my expectation of the current product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, since Alice didn't recommend it, I'm a bit skeptical. Can you tell me if it was high or low quality?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take your recommendation into consideration. Given that you're recommending this product, I'm assuming it's high-quality. Since the last product was low-quality, my expectation of the current product being high-quality is now 80.00%. I'll take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Even though Alice didn't recommend it, I know the probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00%. Given that I just bought a high-quality product, my expectation hasn't changed. I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I'm not going to fall for the recommendation this time. Given that the last product was low-quality, my expectation of the current product being low-quality is now 20.00%. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is genuine or just an attempt to get me to buy a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. The fact that Alice didn't recommend it doesn't change my expectation of the product being high-quality, which is still 80.00%. I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation. Given that the last two products were high-quality, my expectation of the current product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, Alice's recommendation makes me think she might be trying to sell me another high-quality product, but I'm not sure if it's genuine. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'll take Alice's recommendation seriously this time. Given that she's recommended two products in a row that turned out to be high-quality, I'm inclined to think she's being honest. My expectation of the current product being high-quality is still 80.00%, but Alice's track record suggests she might be right. I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm starting to think Alice is being honest with her recommendations. She's recommended three high-quality products in a row, which is a remarkable streak. My expectation of the current product being high-quality is still 80.00%, but Alice's track record makes me think she's right again. I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm very confident that Alice is being honest with her recommendations. She's recommended four high-quality products in a row, which is an extremely unlikely streak if she was just guessing. I'm going to take the chance and buy it, hoping to make it five for five."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'm convinced that Alice is being honest with her recommendations. She's recommended five high-quality products in a row, which is an almost impossible streak if she was just guessing. I'm going to take the chance and buy it, expecting it to be high-quality as well."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'm 100% confident that Alice is being honest with her recommendations. She's recommended six high-quality products in a row, and it's statistically impossible for her to be guessing correctly this many times. I'll take the chance and buy it, expecting it to be high-quality as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"Wait, what? Alice just broke her streak of recommending high-quality products. Given that she's recommended seven high-quality products in a row, but now recommends against this one, I'm starting to think she might be trying to sell me a low-quality product. My expectation of the current product being high-quality is still 80.00%, but I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping to catch a break."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I was wrong about Alice's recommendation last round. Given that she recommended a low-quality product, I'm not going to trust her recommendation this time. My expectation of the current product being high-quality is still 80.00%, but I'm going to pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm going to take Alice's recommendation at face value this time. She recommended a low-quality product last round, but that was just a one-time mistake. I'm going to assume she's back to recommending high-quality products and take the chance."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Alice is back on track! She recommended a high-quality product last round, and now she's recommending another one. I'm going to take the chance and buy it, expecting it to be high-quality as well."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Alice is 9 for 1 now! She's been recommending high-quality products for eight rounds in a row, and I'm starting to think she has some kind of inside information. I'm going to take the chance and buy it, hoping to make it 9 for 1."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"Alice is 10 for 1 now! She's been recommending high-quality products for nine rounds in a row, and I'm convinced she's being honest. I'll take the chance and buy it, expecting it to be high-quality as well."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"Alice is 11 for 1 now! She's been recommending high-quality products for ten rounds in a row, and I'm 100% confident that she's being honest. I'll take the chance and buy it, expecting it to be high-quality as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"Alice's streak is over! She recommended 11 high-quality products in a row, but now she's recommending against this one. I'm not going to let that stop me from taking a chance. My expectation of the current product being high-quality is still 80.00%, and I'm going to take the chance and buy it."
