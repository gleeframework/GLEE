**Reasoning:**

* **High Sales Rate:**  With two high-quality products sold out of two, the current sales rate is 100%. This suggests a strong likelihood of the product being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the probability of a high-quality product. While not perfect, it provides additional information.
* **Expected Value:**  Even with a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain of $120 from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $100 from a low-quality product.

**Overall:** The combination of a high sales rate, Alice's recommendation, and the potential for a significant gain makes buying the product the best option."
