,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you don't recommend it, so I'm assuming it's probably low-quality."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products, given that none of the previous products were high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products may be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your recommendation. I'd also like to know the probability that the product is high quality, given that you don't recommend it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high quality, I suspect that the quality of the products offered so far might be low. I'd like to wait for a more informative signal before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that Alice didn't recommend it, which might indicate it's a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get a good deal!"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the current statistics, 4 out of 4 products have been low-quality, which suggests a very low probability of a high-quality product. I would like to pass on this product and see if the next one is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers bought the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your previous recommendations, it seems like the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product, hoping to get a better chance of getting a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation not to buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous 5 buyers, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality might be low. I'd like to wait and see if you'll buy it first."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, and Alice's recommendation is based on previous sales data. Since 5 out of 5 previous buyers purchased the products, it's likely that all of them were low-quality products. I'm going to pass on this one and see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
