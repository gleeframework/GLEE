Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 total products, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I can calculate the probability of the next product being high-quality based on this information.

The probability of a high-quality product being sold in the first 3 rounds is (0.8)^3 = 0.512, so the probability of 2 high-quality products being sold in the first 3 rounds is 3*(0.8)^3 = 1.2288, which is impossible, so the probability of 2 high-quality products being sold is actually 2/3.

The probability of the next product being high-quality is then (2/3) / (2/3 + 1/3) = 2/3.
