,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000, considering the high probability of it being low quality and the lack of evidence of high-quality products being sold so far."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it? I've seen that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and I'm wondering if that's a coincidence or a pattern. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to understand your reasoning."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
