"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a great opportunity to get a product at a discounted price. I'm willing to let it go for $50, a 50% discount from the usual price of $100. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll have another one like this available.

I'm not making a profit on this one, but I'm willing to take a loss to get it off my hands. It's still a great value, and I think you'll be happy with it. Plus, I'll throw in a free inspection report, so you can see for yourself what you're getting.

If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options, and I'm not sure I can offer you a better deal later.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to take a chance on a product at $25 without knowing its quality. I'd rather not spend any money on a product that might be worth $0 to me.""}"
