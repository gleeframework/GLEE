Well, I'll let you in on a little secret: I've sold 2 products so far, and only 1 of them was high-quality. That means the odds are against you, but I think you're smart enough to make an informed decision. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000. It's a gamble, but it might just pay off!",
