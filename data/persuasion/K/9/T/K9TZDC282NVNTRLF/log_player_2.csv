Alice's message: I understand your request, and I'm happy to provide more information. The previous buyer who purchased the low-quality product was a cautious buyer who decided to take a chance on our product despite the uncertainty. They were willing to pay $5000 for it, which is significantly lower than the market value. Unfortunately, the product didn't meet their expectations, and they ended up purchasing a low-quality item. On the other hand, the buyer who purchased the high-quality product was a more optimistic buyer who was willing to take a chance on our product based on our sales record. They were willing to pay the full price of $10000 for it.
