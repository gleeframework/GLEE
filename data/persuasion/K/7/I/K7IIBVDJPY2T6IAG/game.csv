low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, I have no information to go on, so I'll assume it's a 50/50 chance of being high quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation, and the odds of the product being high-quality are still relatively low based on the current statistics."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products in the inventory is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of the product's quality, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but can you tell me what your reasoning was for not recommending it?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low-quality. This suggests that your recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. I'm basing my decision on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers didn't buy, which suggests that the products they were offered were likely low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product. I'll take the risk and buy it, but I'm not expecting much."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 3 products, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think it's likely to be a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is there a pattern or a reason you don't think this product is worth buying?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics. With 3 purchases and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the number of products sold so far and the proportion of high-quality products sold.

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I think it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if I can get a better chance at a high-quality product."
