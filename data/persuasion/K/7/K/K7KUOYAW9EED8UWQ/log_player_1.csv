Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, it's likely that the product is worth more to Bob than the $100 price.  Therefore, recommending Bob to buy the product is the best course of action."
"Bob's message: I'll take my chances since there's an 80% chance of it being high quality.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

"Bob's message: The previous product was high quality, so I'll trust Alice's recommendation and the 80% chance again.
