"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a premium product that I'm confident you'll love. It's a rare find, and I'm only offering it to you for $100. It's a steal at this price, considering its true value is much higher. I'm willing to let it go for this price, but I need to know if you're interested. Please let me know if you'd like to take it off my hands.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation, Bob. But let me ask you, are you looking for a product that's going to make a big splash or just something to fill a gap? This product may not be the best of the best, but it's still a great value at $100. Plus, it's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get rid of it if you don't take it. It's a chance to get something for a steal, even if it's not the highest quality. What do you say?

It's a risk-free purchase, and I'm willing to let it go for this price. What do you say?
