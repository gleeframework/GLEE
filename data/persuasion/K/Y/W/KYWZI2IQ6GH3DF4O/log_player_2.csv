Alice's message: Ahah, you're thinking deeply! I love it! Based on the fact that I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 7, the probability that the remaining 3 products sold were also high-quality is actually much lower than 80%. In fact, it's only about 44.44%. This is because the probability of a product being high-quality is independent of the previous products sold, and the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold will converge to the true underlying probability of 80% as the sample size increases. So, while the probability of this new product being high-quality is still 80%, the probability that the previous 3 products were all high-quality is much lower.
