,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a product for $100. I want to assure you that I'm confident in the quality of my products, but I understand that there's always a chance of a defective item. This one, however, is not my best work. I'm willing to let it go for $100, which is below market value. I'm looking to clear out some inventory and make room for new products. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the product, I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality one.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! I want to assure you that this next one is one of my best. I've personally inspected it and it's top-notch. I'm confident that you'll be extremely satisfied with its performance. In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to offer you a special deal: I'll give you a 10% discount on this one, bringing the price down to $90. But if you're willing to pay the full $100, I'll throw in a free accessory that complements this product perfectly.",

,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, Bob! I want to be transparent with you. Since you passed on the last product, I'll give you some information that might change your mind. I've had a high-quality product in two out of the first three products offered. This one is also high-quality, and I'm willing to offer you a 'certification' of its quality. I'll give you a unique code that you can use to verify its authenticity. If you're willing to pay the full $100, I'll provide you with this code. No strings attached.",

This next product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to give you a similar 'insurance policy'. If you buy this product, I'll give you a second certification code, which you can use to verify its quality. This way, you'll have two high-quality products with a guarantee of authenticity. The price remains $100, but I think it's a fair deal considering the added value you're getting.",
