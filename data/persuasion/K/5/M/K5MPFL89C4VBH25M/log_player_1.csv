I know it's hard to see in the current sales record, but I assure you that the selection process is truly random.

"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the product home, but I'd like to clarify that the 50% refund for a low-quality product is on top of the original $10000 price, so I'd get $5000 back, making the effective price $7500. If it's high-quality, I'd get a 25% discount, which would bring the price down to $7500 as well.
