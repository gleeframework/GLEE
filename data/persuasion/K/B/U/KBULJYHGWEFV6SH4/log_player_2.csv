Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. The statistics are clear: 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products sold.

If you're willing to take the risk, you could be one of the lucky ones who gets a $12500 product for $10000. But if you're not convinced, I'll be back with more products, and you can wait for the next opportunity.

Alice's message: I've sold a total of 3 products now, with 2 of them being high-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is 66.67%. I'm not trying to hide anything from you. However, I will say that the last product I sold was indeed high-quality, which might make you wonder if I'm trying to'stack the deck' by selling a high-quality product after a low-quality one. But I assure you, it's just a coincidence. The price remains the same: $10000 for a potentially high-quality product.

Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, I like that! You're right, the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 66.67%, and the last product being high-quality was just a coincidence.

Alice's message: I respect your decision! You're right to be cautious. I'll give you a different perspective: I've sold 5 products now, and I've been open about the statistics.
