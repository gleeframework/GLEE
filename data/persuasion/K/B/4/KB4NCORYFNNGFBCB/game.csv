,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were discouraged by your recommendations, and none of them bought the product, it's likely that the products offered were low-quality.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation doesn't take into account the probability of the product being high or low quality, and the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which might indicate a bias towards low-quality products in the selection."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers bought a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data or a different recommendation from Alice before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.

I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the pattern holds."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, since the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate a higher likelihood of the product being low quality, but the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%."
