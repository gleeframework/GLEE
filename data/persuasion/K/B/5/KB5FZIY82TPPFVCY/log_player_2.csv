**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only know one product was sold, and it was high quality. This doesn't give us enough data to make a statistically sound decision.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice is recommending the purchase, and she has no incentive to mislead us (we assume she wants to sell products).  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($20,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).

**Therefore, it's a calculated risk worth taking given the limited information.**"
