This is on top of the original price of $1000000. I'm willing to take on this risk because I'm confident in the product's value and I want to demonstrate my commitment to transparency and fairness.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I decline your offer since, despite the attractive 'no-risk' guarantee, I've been misled by your pricing commitments multiple times in the past.

I'm willing to work with you to find a price that reflects the product's value and our shared understanding of its worth.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I decline your offer since, although I appreciate the effort to acknowledge past mistakes and apologize, I need to see tangible actions that demonstrate a commitment to change. A public statement and audit are steps in the right direction, but I'm still wary of your pricing practices. I'd like to see a consistent track record of fair and transparent dealings before I consider making another purchase.
