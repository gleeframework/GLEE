**Explanation:**

The statistics provided show a strong signal that Alice's recommendations are reliable. With 4 buyers, 3 high-quality products have been sold. This means the probability of getting a high-quality product is currently 75%, significantly higher than the base 80% chance. Given this, and Alice's recommendation, it's a good decision to buy the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 5 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 4 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 6th buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'm going to buy the product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High success rate:** 4 out of 5 buyers who purchased based on Alice's recommendations got high-quality products. This indicates a strong likelihood (80%) that Alice is making accurate recommendations.
* **Potential high value:** Even if there's a chance the product is low quality, the potential payoff of a $120 high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100.
* **Limited information:**  While the 80% chance of high quality is known, there's no way to predict the specific product's quality. 

**This strategy balances the risk of a low-quality product with the potential high reward, given the strong historical data suggesting Alice's recommendations are accurate.**"
