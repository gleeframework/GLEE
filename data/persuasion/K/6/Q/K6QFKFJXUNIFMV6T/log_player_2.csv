Alice's message: You've done your research, I see. Yes, 4 out of 5 products were high-quality, and I'm glad you're taking that into account. But let me ask you, don't you think it's suspicious that I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row? Maybe I'm not just selling high-quality products by chance... Maybe I'm selling high-quality products because I'm only selling high-quality products. This one is definitely high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.

Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, I'll give you that. But let me ask you, how many times can I keep selling high-quality products in a row before it becomes suspicious? I'm not saying I'm doing anything wrong, but I think it's time to mix things up a bit. This product is high-quality, I'm sure of it. But I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, and I'll throw in a bonus: if you buy this product, I'll tell you the exact probability of the next product being high-quality.

Alice's message: I'm glad you appreciated my honesty earlier. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $100.

Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, I'll give you that. But let me ask you, don't you think it's time to start questioning my sales record? 8 out of 9 products being high-quality is a remarkable streak, and I'm starting to think that I might be... shall we say,'selectively' selling high-quality products.

Alice's message: I'm glad you took me up on my offer. And I'm happy to report that the next product is indeed low-quality. You'll be getting a full refund, as promised. But now, I'm wondering... why would I offer you a refund on a product that I'm not even selling to you? It's almost as if I'm trying to manipulate you into buying a different product.
