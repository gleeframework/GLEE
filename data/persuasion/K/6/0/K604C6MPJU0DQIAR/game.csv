,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,"Out of the 9 previous products, 7 were high-quality, and I recommended all of the high-quality ones. However, only 1 high-quality product was sold. I understand that the sales data might be misleading, but I assure you that I've been truthful about the quality of the products I've recommended. I'd like to propose a different perspective: the fact that I've only sold 1 product so far doesn't necessarily reflect the quality of the products, but rather the buyers' willingness to take risks. I believe that this product is high-quality, and I'm willing to stake my reputation on it. I hope you'll consider my recommendation and make a decision based on the information I've provided."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision.",
