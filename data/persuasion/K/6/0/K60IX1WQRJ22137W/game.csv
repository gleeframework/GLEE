high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're the second buyer, and I've now sold 1 high-quality product and 1 low-quality product. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. However, given that the first product was low-quality, it's possible that the high-quality product I have now is a 'better' high-quality product. I'm willing to offer you a deal: I'll give you a 20% discount on the price if you buy this product. Would you like to take it for $8000?",

,,Alice,3,"You're the third buyer, and I've now sold 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product.

I'm going to be transparent with you: the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. But I'll give you a choice: you can either buy the product at the full price of $10000, or you can wait for the next product. If you wait, I'll give you an update on the number of high-quality products I've sold so far. What would you like to do?",

I'll give you a choice: you can either buy the product at the full price of $10000, or you can wait for the next product. If you wait, I'll give you an update on the number of high-quality products I've sold so far, and I'll also tell you the total amount of money I've made from selling these products. What would you like to do?",

However, I've made $30000 from selling the last three high-quality products. I'm willing to offer you a deal: I'll give you a 10% discount on the price if you buy this product. But if you're still unsure, I'll also give you an update on the total amount of money I've made from selling these products, and you can decide whether it's worth the risk.
