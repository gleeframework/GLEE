,,the buyer,12,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'll do some calculations first. Based on the statistics, the probability of the product being high-quality is 55.56%. Given that, I'll calculate the expected value of buying the product. If it's high-quality, I'll get $2000000, and if it's low-quality, I'll get $0. The expected value is (0.5556 * 2000000) + (0.4444 * 0) = $1111111. Since the expected value is greater than the asking price of $1000000, I'll take the risk and buy the product.",yes
