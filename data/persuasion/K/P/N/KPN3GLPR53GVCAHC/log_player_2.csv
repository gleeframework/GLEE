"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the true value of the product, and she's recommending it, it's likely to be high quality. While there's still a 50% chance it's low quality, the potential payoff of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality one."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is now a strong signal.  She's likely not recommending the product because it's low quality. While it could still be high quality,  the risk of losing $100 on a low-quality product is too high given the potential reward."

```

**Reasoning:**

While the previous round was a high-quality product that you missed out on, it's important to remember that Alice has been consistently accurate in her recommendations. The pattern of not recommending the product has led to avoiding low-quality products. 

It's tempting to think that a change in pattern could mean a high-quality product, but it's still wiser to follow the established pattern and trust Alice's advice.  The potential loss of $100 is less risky than potentially losing $200 based on a single deviation."

However, the risk of a $100 loss is still less than the potential reward of a $200 gain, particularly considering the large sample size.
