,,Alice,1,"You're in luck! This is one of the best products I've ever had the pleasure of offering. With a proven track record of 100% high-quality products sold, I'm confident that this one will exceed your expectations. Don't miss out on this opportunity to own a product worth $3000000 to you. The price is still $1000000, a small fraction of its true value. What do you say? Will you take it home today?",
,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the information, Alice. While your offer is tempting, I need more data to make a decision. I'm interested in seeing how this product performs with other buyers before I commit. Please let me know if you have any other products available or if this one sells to someone else. I'll keep an eye on the sales record.",no

Since you're interested in seeing the sales record, I'll let you know that I've sold 2 out of 2 products so far, both of which were high-quality. The price is still $1000000, a small fraction of its true value. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this one?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for your offer, but I'm still hesitant to buy without more information. While your sales record is promising, it's too small to be truly indicative.  I'd like to see more sales data before making a decision.  Perhaps we can discuss this further after a few more products have been sold and the sales record has grown?",no

Will you join the exclusive club of my loyal customers?",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While the track record is impressive, I'm hesitant to purchase at this price. It's still a significant risk given the 20% chance of a low-quality product.  I'd be more interested in buying if the price was adjusted to reflect the uncertainty. Perhaps a lower price, or a money-back guarantee if the product turns out to be low quality?  I'm sure there will be other opportunities in the future.",no
