,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to ask, can you tell me what led you to recommend not buying this product? Is there any information you can share about the product's quality based on the previous sales record?"

,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 2 products sold was high quality, which is a lower proportion than the overall probability of a product being high quality (80%). This suggests that the sample may be biased towards low-quality products, so I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than the average, given the previous sales record."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 high-quality products were sold out of 3, I think the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that 2 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the products, which suggests a higher proportion of high-quality products than the overall 80% chance. I'm hoping to catch a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that I might be taking a risk."
