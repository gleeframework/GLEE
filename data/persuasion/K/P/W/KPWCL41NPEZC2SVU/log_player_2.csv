Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation, Bob. Let me offer you a different perspective. This product may not be as flashy as the first one, but it's still a great opportunity to get a unique item at a fraction of its true value. I'm only asking for $10000, which is a small price to pay for the chance to own something that's truly one-of-a-kind. Plus, who knows, you might be able to find a way to repurpose it or give it as a gift. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this underdog?
