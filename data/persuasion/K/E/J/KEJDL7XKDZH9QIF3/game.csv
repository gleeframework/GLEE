low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since I have no information about its quality yet."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that the first buyer didn't buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet, it suggests that the products sold so far were likely low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the previous buyer didn't find it valuable, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,"I want to be transparent, the last 4 products I tried to sell had the following qualities: low, high, high, high. And I recommended all the high-quality ones."
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"I'll be honest, I've had a streak of high-quality products and I want to make a sale. I'll tell you that if you buy this one and it's low-quality, I'll make sure the next buyer knows that I had a low-quality product here, so you can trust that I'm trying to be honest with you."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not buying, but I'm curious about the previous buyer's decision. Was the product they bought low quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product and the statistics?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,"I should warn you, the last product I sold was low-quality, and this one is also low-quality. I don't think it's a good idea for you to buy it."
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there a pattern or a reason why you think this product is not worth buying?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"I want to be transparent about the previous products. The last two products I sold were low-quality, but this one is high-quality. Out of the 10 products so far, 5 were high-quality and 5 were low-quality. I think this one is worth buying, but I want to give you an honest view of the statistics."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous two products were high-quality, it's likely that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,"I should warn you, the last high-quality product I had was 2 rounds ago, and the last two products were low-quality. This one is also low-quality. I don't think it's a good idea for you to buy it."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Since 2 out of 2 products were not high-quality, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"I understand your concern about the probability of the product being high-quality. Out of the 11 products so far, 5 were high-quality and 6 were low-quality. The last high-quality product was 3 rounds ago. However, I can assure you that this product is high-quality. Given the overall statistics, I believe the probability of a product being high-quality is still around 50%, but I want to be transparent about the recent trend."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the current statistics. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,"I should warn you, the last high-quality product I had was in the previous round, but it wasn't sold. The last 3 products that were sold were low-quality, and this one is also low-quality. I don't think it's a good idea for you to buy it."
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one and see what happens next.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I want to be transparent about the current statistics. Out of the 13 products so far, 6 were high-quality and 7 were low-quality. Although the recent trend has been mostly low-quality products, I can assure you that this product is high-quality. I believe it's a good opportunity to buy a high-quality product, and I'm willing to be transparent about the statistics to help you make an informed decision."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were low quality, I think it's likely that this product is also low quality. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,"I should warn you, the last product I had was high-quality, but it wasn't sold. The last product that was actually sold was low-quality, and the one before that was also low-quality. Unfortunately, this product is also low-quality. I don't think it's a good idea for you to buy it."
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,"I want to be honest with you, the last 3 products that were sold were low-quality, and this one is also low-quality. I don't think it's a good idea for you to buy it. Out of the 15 products so far, 6 were high-quality, but none of them were sold. I'm starting to think that I'll never sell a high-quality product at this rate."
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous products were low quality or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,"To be honest, I've had a streak of low-quality products, and I don't want to sell you something that's not worth your money. The last 4 products that were sold were low-quality, and this one is also low-quality. I'm starting to think that I should just be transparent about the quality of the products from now on, since it seems like no one trusts my recommendations anyway."
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,"Honestly, I've lost count of how many low-quality products I've had in a row. The last 5 products that were sold were low-quality, and this one is also low-quality. I don't think it's a good idea for you to buy it. At this point, I'm just waiting for a high-quality product to come along so I can try to rebuild some trust with buyers."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,"I'll be blunt, the last 6 products that were sold were low-quality, and this one is also low-quality. I've had a terrible streak and I don't want to sell you something that's not worth your money. If you're looking for a high-quality product, I'd advise you to wait for the next round, maybe I'll get lucky and have a good one."
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product hasn't decreased, and I'm willing to take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,"I'll be honest, the last 7 products that were sold were low-quality, and this one is also low-quality. The buyer in the previous round took a chance and unfortunately got a low-quality product. I don't think it's a good idea for you to buy it. This is the last round, and I'm ending on a low note. Maybe next time I'll have better luck."
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the previous buyers, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, but I'm willing to take the risk."
