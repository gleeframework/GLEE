,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in purchasing the product. I'd like to remind you that the product is worth $12000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'm willing to throw in a premium warranty that covers any potential issues with the product for the next 2 years. This warranty is only available for a limited time, and I think it's a great value add to the product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the offer, but considering the product was low-quality and only worth $0 to me, I think it's best to pass on this opportunity. I appreciate the warranty offer, but it doesn't change the fact that the product itself does not meet my needs or expectations.",no

If you purchase this product now, I'll not only provide you with the inspection, but I'll also include a personalized setup and training session, worth an additional $1000. This way, you'll not only get to verify the product's quality but also get the most out of it from the start. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"Thank you for the offer, but given the history of low-quality products and the uncertainty about the inspection process, I think it's best to pass on this opportunity. I appreciate the added value of the setup and training session, but it doesn't outweigh the risk associated with the product's quality.",no

,,Bob,6,"Thank you for the offer, but I think it's best to pass on this opportunity. Despite the discount, the risk of purchasing a low-quality product again is too high for me. I appreciate your efforts to offer value, but my decision is based on the uncertainty of product quality.",no

,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're confident in the 'guaranteed high-quality' offer. However, I'd like to take a different approach this time. I'm willing to offer you a 'take it or leave it' deal. I'll give you the product at the original price of $10000, but I'll also include a separate, unrelated high-quality product of your choice, valued at $8000. This way, you'll get a high-quality product, and I'll take the low-quality product off your hands. It's a win-win situation. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the 'take it or leave it' deal, especially since it includes an additional high-quality product valued at $8000.

This brings the price down to $8000. I'll also include a personalized thank-you gift, valued at $1000, for your loyalty and trust in our business. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,"Thank you for the 'VIP discount' and the personalized thank-you gift, but considering the history of low-quality products and the uncertainty of receiving a valuable gift, I think it's best to pass on this opportunity. I appreciate the discounts and the gesture, but the risk of purchasing a low-quality product outweighs the benefits. Thank you for your understanding and continued support.",no
