**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** With only one previous sale, we have very limited information about the quality of Alice's products.
* **Positive Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a positive signal, even if it's based on very little data.
* **Potential Upside:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0).

**Strategy:**  Given the limited data, it's a gamble, but the potential upside justifies taking the risk."

**Explanation:**

* **The data:** The statistics show that 14 out of 16 products sold were high-quality. This means the probability of a product being high quality is roughly 87.5%.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which further strengthens the belief that the product is likely high quality.
* **Expected Value:** Given the high probability of the product being high quality, the expected value of buying is positive.  
    *  Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality) 
    *  Expected Value = (0.875 * $125) + (0.125 * $0) = $109.375 
* **Decision:** The expected value of buying the product is significantly higher than the price of $100, making it a rational decision to buy."
