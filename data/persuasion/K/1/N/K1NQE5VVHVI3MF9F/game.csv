,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea given Alice's recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'm starting to think that you might be recommending low-quality products to the previous buyers.

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product that Alice doesn't recommend, especially considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers also passed, and none of the high-quality products were sold, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to wait for a future product with a potentially higher probability of being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. Given that 3 previous buyers also decided not to buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this product. I think the probability of it being high-quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the previous 3 buyers were unlucky and the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 50% due to the lack of sales."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think the previous 4 buyers were all given low-quality products and I'm trying to take advantage of the situation. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I think there's a good chance this product is high-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. The recommendation from Alice is not convincing enough for me to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product, which would make the proportion of high-quality products sold lower than it initially appears."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can tell me the probability that the product is high quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on your past recommendations. The fact that 7 out of 7 products were recommended to be bought and none were high-quality suggests that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the current statistics, 7 out of 7 products were low quality. I'm skeptical about buying this product. I'd like to pass on it for now."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 7 buyers purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
