You've seen two high-quality products so far. If you buy this third product, you'll have a 3/3 chance of getting a high-quality product, which is a 100% success rate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase.""
}"

If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a guarantee that if you buy 5 more products, at least 4 of them will be high-quality.
