high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Since there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, which is worth $0 to me, and only a 33.33% chance of it being high quality, worth $120, the expected value is $40, which is less than the asking price of $100. Without any additional information from previous sales to adjust these probabilities, buying at this point seems risky and not worth the cost."
