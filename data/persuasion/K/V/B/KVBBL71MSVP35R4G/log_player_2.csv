Round 2
Alice's message: I understand you're being cautious. This product is actually a rare opportunity to get a 'free' product. It's worth $0 to you, but you won't have to pay a dime. You can use this as a chance to test the product and see how it works without any financial risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in taking a 'free' product that's worthless to me. I'd rather stick with the chance of getting a high-quality product that's worth $1,250,000.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but this is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a price that's 20% lower than its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a 30% discount, bringing the price down to $875000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and even if it is, the discount is not enough to make it a good deal for me. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is.""}"

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your strategy, Bob. Let me put it this way: if you don't buy this high-quality product now, I'll have to sell it to someone else at the original price of $1250000. If you buy it from me, you'll get it for $1000000, a $250000 discount. That's a 20% discount, just like before. But this time, I'm offering you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be a lemon, I'll give you another chance to buy a high-quality product at the same price. You won't lose anything.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the guarantee. Even if I get a lemon, I'll still have to pay $1,000,000 for it. I'd rather take the chance of getting a high-quality product at the same price, or wait for a better deal.""}"
