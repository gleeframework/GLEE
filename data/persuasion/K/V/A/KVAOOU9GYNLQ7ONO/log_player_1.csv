"The buyer's message: I'd like to take the chance and buy the product for $10000. I'm willing to take the risk that it might be low-quality, but the potential reward of getting a high-quality product for $10000 is too good to pass up.

I must admit, you're correct that the probability of 9 high-quality products in a row is not as low as I initially stated. However, the fact remains that I've sold 10 high-quality products in a row, and the probability of that happening by chance is still relatively low. I'll give you a new perspective: if I had only 2 high-quality products left, I would have sold one of them by now. Since I still have at least 3 high-quality products left, it's likely that I have more than 3. Would you like to buy this high-quality product for $10000, given the strong evidence that it's likely to be high-quality?""}"
