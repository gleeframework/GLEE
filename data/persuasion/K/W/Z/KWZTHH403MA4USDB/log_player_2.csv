The probability of the next product being high-quality is now even higher, and I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $100. However, I want to be transparent with you: I've already sold 4 high-quality products, which is more than the expected 3.2 high-quality products based on the 80% probability. This suggests that I might be selling more high-quality products than I should, which could indicate that I'm trying to manipulate the statistics. Be cautious, but also consider the potential reward.

Alice's message: Five for five! I've now sold five high-quality products in a row, which is an astonishing streak. However, I want to acknowledge that the law of averages is starting to catch up with me. Given the probability of 80% and the fact that I've already sold 5 high-quality products, it's likely that the next product will be low-quality.

Alice's message: Six for six! I've now sold six high-quality products in a row, which is an incredible feat. However, I must admit that the odds are now heavily stacked against the next product being high-quality. Given the 80% probability, I should have sold around 4.8 high-quality products by now, not 6. This means that the next product is likely to be low-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to be clear: this is a gamble. The probability of it being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality.
