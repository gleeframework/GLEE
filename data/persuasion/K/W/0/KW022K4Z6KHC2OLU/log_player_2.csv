However, it just so happens that the first three products I've offered have been high-quality. I hope this information helps, and I'm willing to let my future sales data speak for itself.

Alice's message: Welcome! I understand that the previous buyers had concerns about the randomness of my product offerings.

To alleviate your concerns, I'd like to share my current statistics: 0 products sold, 4 high-quality products offered but not sold. I know it's unusual to have four high-quality products in a row, but I assure you that it's just a coincidence. I'm willing to continue offering products and letting the sales data speak for itself. If you're willing to take a chance, I'm offering this product for $100. Additionally, I'd like to make a commitment to you: if you buy this product and it's not satisfactory, I'll make sure to disclose the quality of the next few products I offer, so you can see that my offerings are indeed random.
