Alice's message: I understand your skepticism. I'm not trying to influence you, I promise. Let me give you a detailed breakdown of the sales record. Out of 6 products sold, 2 were high-quality and 4 were low-quality. The remaining 4 products available are a mix of both. This next product is not one of the high-quality ones, but it's still a great opportunity to get a good deal. I'm willing to be transparent about the quality, so I'll let you know that this one is low-quality. The price remains $1000000.
