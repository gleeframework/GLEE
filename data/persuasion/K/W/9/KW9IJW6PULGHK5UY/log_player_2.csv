Alice's message: I understand your skepticism about the guarantee. You're right to question the distribution of high-quality products. Since I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 6 products offered, and assuming the products are randomly distributed, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. However, considering the fact that the previous 2 buyers passed on the last two products, and the fact that I've sold a low-quality product this round, it's possible that the high-quality products are more likely to be sold in the next few rounds. I'm willing to sell this product to you for the standard price of $1000000. It's a good opportunity to get a product at a fair price, and who knows, it might be a high-quality one!
