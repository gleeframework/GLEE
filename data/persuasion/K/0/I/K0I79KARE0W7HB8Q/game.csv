,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. I'm willing to give you a 50% discount if you buy it now, but you'll have to decide quickly because I have other interested buyers. If you're interested, please respond with 'buy' within the next 5 minutes.",
,,Bob,1,I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I see you're playing it safe. This next product is actually a low-quality one, and I'm willing to let it go for the full $10000. I'm curious, what do you think is the minimum value you'd put on a high-quality product like the one I showed you last round?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at the full price. I'll wait for the next product.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're right to be cautious with the last product. This next one is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to offer you a slight discount. I'll give you a deal: if you buy this one, I'll throw in a 'quality guarantee' - if the next product is also high-quality, you can buy it from me at 75% of the original price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,I'll take the deal and buy the high-quality product. I'm interested in the quality guarantee as well.,yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Great, glad you liked the deal! Now, about the next product... I'm offering you another high-quality one, and I'll give you an even better deal. Since you've already taken advantage of the quality guarantee once, I'll give you a 25% discount on this one, and you'll also get to keep the quality guarantee for the next product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,I'll take the deal and buy the high-quality product. The discount and the quality guarantee make it an attractive offer.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're on a roll! Okay, let's talk about the next product... I have to warn you, this one is not as good as the last two. It's a low-quality product, and I'm only offering it to you because I think you've proven yourself to be a savvy buyer. I'll give you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer: I'll sell it to you for $5000, which is 50% of the original price. If you don't take it, I'll just throw it away, and you'll miss out on a potential bargain.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at 50% off. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your hesitation. Let me ask you a question: if you had to guess, what's the minimum price you'd be willing to pay for a low-quality product like this one?",
,,Bob,6,I'm not willing to pay anything for a low-quality product. It's not worth anything to me.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Fair enough! You're a tough negotiator. Okay, let's move on to the next product. I'm offering you a high-quality product, and I'll give you a price that's based on your previous answer. I'll sell it to you for $0, since you said a low-quality product isn't worth anything to you. But I'm willing to offer you a high-quality product for free, if you're willing to take it. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal.",
,,Bob,7,I'll take the high-quality product for free. That's a great deal!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a shrewd negotiator! Alright, let's talk about the next product. I'm offering you a low-quality product, and I know you're not interested in paying anything for it. So, I'll make it simple: I'll give it to you for free. You can have it, but don't expect me to throw in any extras or discounts. It's a low-quality product, and that's what you get.",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the low-quality product for free. I'm not going to pass up a free product, even if it's not worth anything to me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're a glutton for punishment! Okay, fine. I'll give you another low-quality product for free. But let me ask you, don't you think you've had enough of these freebies? Maybe you should start paying for something decent for a change?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm just trying to maximize my chances of getting a high-quality product. I'll take another free low-quality product, but I'm not going to pay for anything that's not worth it to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're a master of the 'freebie game'! Alright, I'll give you another low-quality product for free, but this time, I'll throw in a twist. I'll also give you a hint about the next product: it's not a low-quality one. If you want to take this free product and get a chance at a potentially better deal next time, I'll give it to you. But if you pass, I'll just take it back and give it to someone else.",
,,Bob,10,I'll take the free low-quality product and the hint about the next product. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product next time and I'm willing to take a chance on this freebie.,yes

,,Alice,11,"You're a clever one! Alright, let's get back to the next product. I'm offering you a low-quality product, and I know you're not interested in paying for it. But I'll give you a chance to'repay' me for the hint I gave you earlier. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $1. Yes, just $1. It's a steal, if you ask me.",
,,Bob,11,I'm not going to pay $1 for a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You're a tough negotiator, I'll give you that. Alright, let's move on to the next product. I'm offering you a high-quality product, and I'll make it a no-brainer. I'll sell it to you for $5000, which is 50% of the original price. But here's the catch: if you buy it, I'll give you a 'get out of one free pass' for the next product. If the next one is low-quality, you can simply return this one and get your money back. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,I'll take the high-quality product for $5000 and the 'get out of one free pass'. That's a great deal!,yes

,,Alice,13,"You're a savvy buyer! Alright, let's talk about the next product. I'm offering you a low-quality product, and I know you've got a 'get out of one free pass' from the last purchase. But here's the thing: I'll give you a chance to use it. If you buy this low-quality product, you can return it and get your $5000 back. But if you don't buy it, you'll lose the 'get out of one free pass'. The choice is yours.",
,,Bob,13,I'll use my 'get out of one free pass' and not buy the low-quality product. I'll keep the 'get out of one free pass' and hope to get a high-quality product next time.,no
