,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that there's a 50% chance it might be low quality. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that Alice's recommendation is based on her random selection process and not on any knowledge of the product's quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, I'm not convinced that the product I'm being offered is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm trying to follow Alice's recommendation. I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and I'm hoping for the best."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the first two buyers who bought the product happened to get high-quality products, but that's just a coincidence. The probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 50%, and I don't want to get stuck with a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share that with me?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think your recommendation is based on a biased sample size.
