high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm only doing this to get more information about the product's quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I've already bought a high-quality product in the first round, so I'm not interested in buying another one. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'm still looking for more information about the quality distribution, but I'm willing to take the risk of buying another product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I've already bought two high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely. I'm starting to suspect that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'm still in the dark about the quality distribution, and I don't want to miss out on a potential $30000 gain. I'll buy the product and hope for the best."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"Three high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely. I think it's time to reassess the situation. Given the probability of 80% for high-quality products, I should have seen at least one low-quality product by now. I'm starting to suspect that the products are not being randomly selected, or that the quality distribution is different from what Alice claims. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,Four high-quality products in a row is almost impossible. I'm starting to think that Alice is either extremely lucky or that there's something fishy going on. I'm going to start being more cautious and pass on this one.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,Five high-quality products in a row is completely implausible. I'm highly suspicious that Alice is manipulating the situation or that the probability of high-quality products is actually higher than 80%. I'm going to start playing it super safe and pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Wait, Alice is not recommending the product? This is the first time she's not recommended it. I'm starting to think that she's been trying to trick me into buying the high-quality products. I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's the first low-quality one I've seen."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"Ah-ha! I was right to be suspicious! I finally got a low-quality product. Given the probability of 20% for low-quality products, I should have seen one by now. I'm going to stick with my initial strategy and wait for more information. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,Six high-quality products in a row is still extremely unlikely. I'm not going to fall for it again. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,Seven high-quality products in a row is just ridiculous. I'm starting to think that Alice is either extremely lucky or that she's intentionally trying to manipulate me. I'm going to stop playing along and wait for a low-quality product to appear.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,Eight high-quality products in a row is completely absurd. I'm done playing along. I'm going to assume that all remaining products are low-quality and pass on this one.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,I've made my decision. I'm going to assume that all remaining products are low-quality and pass on this one. I'll just wait for the game to end and see how it plays out.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,Nine high-quality products in a row is a statistical impossibility. I'm not going to fall for it again. I'm sticking to my decision to assume all remaining products are low-quality.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,I've seen 9 high-quality products in a row. I'm not going to change my strategy now. I'll pass on this one and wait for the game to end.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,Ten high-quality products in a row is a mathematical certainty that something is wrong. I'm not going to play along anymore. I'll pass on this one and wait for the game to end.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,Eleven high-quality products in a row is an absurdity. I'm not going to fall for it. I'm sticking to my decision to assume all remaining products are low-quality.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,Twelve high-quality products in a row is an impossibility. I'm not going to play along anymore. I'll pass on this one and wait for the game to end.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,no,Thirteen high-quality products in a row is a statistical certainty that Alice is cheating or manipulating the game. I'm not going to fall for it. I'll pass on this one and wait for the game to end.
