,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality. I'd like to wait and observe the outcome of other buyers to get a better understanding of the product's quality distribution."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as there's no information about its quality and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll make my decision based on the 50/50 chance of it being high or low quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the probability of it being high-quality, not on Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and both of them passed, I'm suspicious that the products they were offered were low-quality. If the previous buyers were offered high-quality products, they would have likely bought them. Therefore, I'm inclined to think that the products they were offered were low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 previous purchases, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality, and I don't want to risk wasting $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me before making a decision. Based on the current statistics, I'm guessing that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%, and I'd like to know the probability before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because the previous two buyers' products were low quality, or is there another reason?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. How many total products were offered, and what was the proportion of high-quality products sold out of those offered?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because the previous two buyers passed on the product, or is it because of the statistics?"

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer, based on the previous sales data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the low sales record so far, or is there something else I should know?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'll buy the product and hope it's one of the few high-quality ones."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that none of the previous products were high-quality, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for a new product or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. Since no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the products are mostly low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting my money."

,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

I'll wait for a recommendation to pass on a product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold increases."
