Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As the seller, I have no information about the buyer's valuation of the product. The buyer knows that the product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality.  Since this product *is* high-quality, I would recommend the buyer to purchase it.  It's a good opportunity for the buyer to get a high-quality product at a potentially good price."
