}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm making this decision based on the fact that I'm the first buyer and I have no prior information about the quality of the products.

Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""No worries, I completely understand. You're right, with only one high-quality product sold out of 4, the data isn't very informative yet. I'll give you a bit more context: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 4 total products, and 2 low-quality products out of 4. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33% (as stated). I'm offering this one at $1,000,000. If you're willing to take the chance, I'd be happy to sell it to you.""

  ""message"": ""I've calculated the probability of this product being high-quality based on the sales record.

A new potential buyer has arrived!

  ""message"": ""I understand your decision. We've had 7 buyers so far, and 8 products have been sold. Of those 8 products, 3 were high-quality and 5 were low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33% (as stated), but the evidence is now overwhelmingly in favor of low-quality products. I'm offering this one at $1,000,000. If you're willing to take the chance, I'd be happy to sell it to you.""

This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""You're a savvy buyer! You're right, the evidence suggests that the probability of a product being low-quality is indeed higher than 66.67%. I'll give you the exact numbers: 5 low-quality products out of 9 total products sold. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33% (as stated), but the evidence is strongly against it. I'm offering this one at $1,000,000. If you're willing to take the chance, I'd be happy to sell it to you.""
}"

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""We've had 9 buyers so far, and 13 products have been sold. Of those 13 products, 4 were high-quality and 9 were low-quality. You're right to want to know the total numbers, and now you can see the overwhelming evidence against high-quality products. I'm offering this one at $1,000,000. If you're willing to take the chance, I'd be happy to sell it to you.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the statistics. With 9 buyers and 13 products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 4/13, which is roughly 30.77%. However, I know that the true probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. This suggests that the observed proportion may be lower than the true probability due to sampling error. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get more information before making a decision.

The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33% (as stated), but the evidence is still mixed. I'm offering this one at $1,000,000. If you're willing to take the chance, I'd be happy to sell it to you.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm trying to estimate the true probability of a product being high-quality, not because I think this product is definitely high-quality. Can I get the probability of a product being high-quality based on the updated data?
The buyer bought the product!

A new potential buyer has arrived!

However, the Bayesian update suggests that the true probability is likely higher than 33.33%. I'm offering this one at $1,000,000. If you're willing to take the chance, I'd be happy to sell it to you.""

I'll offer it to you for $750,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep selling these products at this price.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the product at the reduced price, but I'm only doing this because I think the low-quality products might be a pattern. I'd like to discuss the possibility of you offering a refund or a replacement if it turns out to be low quality.
