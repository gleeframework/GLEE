But if it's high-quality, you'll get the full value of $400. What do you say?""
}"
"Bob's message: Your offer is still not good enough. I'd rather pay the full price of $100 upfront and take the risk of it being low-quality, rather than risking an even higher price of $100 if it's low-quality with the'second chance' deal.
