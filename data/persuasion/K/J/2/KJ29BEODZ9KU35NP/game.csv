low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I'd like to see the statistics after the first sale to make a more informed decision."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyer didn't find it valuable, and the lack of sold high-quality products suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products being sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since no high-quality products have been sold yet, and the odds of a high-quality product being sold are still 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality given that no high-quality products have been sold yet?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,

,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the statistics on the number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy, but no high-quality products have been sold yet, it suggests that the first buyer may have received a low-quality product. This information makes me less confident in the recommendation, and I'd rather wait for more data or pass on this product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyer bought the product, it suggests that all previous products were low-quality. This increases the probability that the current product is also low-quality, so I'll pass on it."
