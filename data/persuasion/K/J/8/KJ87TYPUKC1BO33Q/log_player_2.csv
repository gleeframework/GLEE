Alice's message: I understand your skepticism. Let me provide you with more information. I've sold a total of 2 products so far, and both of them were low-quality. You can think of this as a random sample of 2 out of a hypothetical total of 6 products (since 2/6 = 33.33% is the probability of a product being high-quality). In this sample, 0 out of 2 products were high-quality. This is a bit worse than the expected 33.33% success rate. I'm still willing to sell this product to you for $10000. What do you think?

Alice's message: Congratulations to the previous buyer on their successful purchase! I'm glad they took a chance on me. Now, let me update you on my sales record. I've sold a total of 4 products, and 1 of them was high-quality. This means that 25% of my products so far have been high-quality, which is lower than the expected 33.33%. However, I'd like to point out that this is still a relatively small sample size, and it's possible that I just got lucky with the previous sale. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000.
