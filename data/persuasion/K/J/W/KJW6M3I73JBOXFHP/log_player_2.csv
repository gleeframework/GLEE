**Reasoning:**

* **The data is promising:**  5 out of 5 products recommended by Alice were high quality. This suggests Alice is very good at identifying high-quality products.
* **The risk is low:** Even if the product is low quality, you lose only $100.  If it's high quality, you gain $20.
* **Alice's recommendation:** This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality. 

**Overall:** The odds are heavily in your favor. It's a calculated risk with a good potential reward."
