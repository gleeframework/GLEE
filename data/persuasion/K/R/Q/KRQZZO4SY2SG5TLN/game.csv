high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,

,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products since 3 out of 3 previous buyers have not found a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products were high quality.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous three products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the products after Alice's recommendation, it seems that Alice's recommendations are based on the quality of the product. Since all 3 previous buyers passed on the products after Alice's recommendation, it's likely that all 3 products were low quality. If I were to buy this product, I'd be basing my decision on Alice's recommendation, which may be influenced by her knowledge of the product's quality. I'd rather wait for a product that hasn't been recommended by Alice, as it may be more likely to be high quality."
