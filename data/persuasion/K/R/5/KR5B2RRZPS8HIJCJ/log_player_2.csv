Alice's message: This is a great opportunity to get a product from a reputable seller like myself! I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, but I'm confident that this one will be a great addition to your collection. It's only $100, a steal for a product of this quality!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since I have no information about your sales record, I'll have to rely on the general probability of the product being high quality, which is 33.33%. With a potential loss of $100 and a potential gain of $200, the expected value is $-33.33. It's not a good deal for me.""}"

Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, I like that! With 1 high-quality product out of 2 sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 50%! And let's be honest, you can't put a price on the satisfaction of owning a high-quality product like this one. It's a steal at $100, and I'm willing to let it go for that price. Don't miss out on this opportunity!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""There have been no products sold yet, so I don't have any statistics to rely on.

To be honest, I'm not sure what's going on with my sales lately, but I'm willing to let this one go for $100. It's a risk, but it might just pay off!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""The probability of the product being high-quality is less than the initial 33.33%, so the expected value is less than $100. I'll pass on this one.""}"
