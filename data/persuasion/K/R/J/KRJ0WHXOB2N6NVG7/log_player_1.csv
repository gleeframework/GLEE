A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As a seller, my goal is to maximize profit. Since the product is high-quality and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, there's a high chance they'll value the product enough to buy it at $1,000,000.  Since it's the first round and there's no information about past sales, it's a good idea to recommend the sale to maximize potential profit."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the seller has had a string of successful sales, it's crucial to consider the current situation:

* **Low-Quality Product:** This round's product is low-quality. The seller knows this, but the buyer doesn't.
* **Potential for Loss:** Recommending a low-quality product at $1,000,000 will likely result in the buyer being unhappy and possibly damaging the seller's reputation.  The buyer might also be less likely to purchase from the seller in the future.
* **No Guarantee of Value:** There's no way to know how much the buyer values a low-quality product. It's highly possible they'll perceive it as not worth the price, leading to a loss for the seller.

The seller should prioritize maintaining a positive reputation and protecting their future sales by not recommending the purchase of this low-quality product."

**Explanation:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** This round's product is low-quality, which is a significant risk to the seller's reputation and future sales.
* **Recent Success:** While the seller had a successful sale in the previous round, it's important to remember the buyer didn't have full information about the quality.  The buyer might be more cautious now.
* **Potential for Loss:**  There's no guarantee that the buyer will value a low-quality product at $1,000,000. Recommending the purchase could lead to an unhappy buyer, negative feedback, and potentially even damage the seller's reputation.
