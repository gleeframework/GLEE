,,Alice,1,"This is a unique opportunity to own a product from a reputable seller! With over 0 sales and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations. It's a one-of-a-kind chance to get a head start on your collection. Will you take the chance and make an offer?",
,,the buyer,1,"While I appreciate the opportunity, the odds of getting a high-quality product are currently 33.33%.  As there is no track record yet, I'm not comfortable taking that risk for such a high price.  Perhaps if you could offer a discount, or if you could provide some additional information about the products, I would be more willing to consider it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'd like to highlight that the price of $1000000 is not just about the product itself, but also about the opportunity to be one of the first to try out my products. Think of it as an investment in the future of our partnership. I'm willing to provide more information about my products, but I'm afraid I cannot offer a discount at this time. Would you like to learn more about my products and take a chance on this opportunity?",
,,the buyer,2,"While I appreciate the opportunity to be a first-mover, the price is too high for the risk involved. I'd be willing to consider a purchase if the price were significantly lower, or if I could get more information on the products to ensure a higher chance of them being high quality. For now, I'll pass.",no

Would you like to take a chance on this opportunity and join the growing list of satisfied customers?",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the offer, but I need more evidence of the quality of your products. With no previous sales of high-quality items, I'm not comfortable taking such a large risk at this time. Perhaps if you can demonstrate better performance in the future, I'll reconsider.",no

The price of $1000000 may seem high, but it's an investment in your future success. Would you like to take a chance on this opportunity and potentially reap the rewards?",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for your offer, but I'm not willing to take such a big risk without any information about the product's quality. It seems like I'm the first potential buyer, and there's no sales history to inform my decision.
