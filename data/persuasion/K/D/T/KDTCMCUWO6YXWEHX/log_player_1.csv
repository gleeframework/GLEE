A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
 
Here's the reasoning:

* **No Sales History:** There is still no sales history to establish a track record of quality, even though this product is high-quality.
* **Risk Aversion:** The buyer is risk-averse and has seen two low-quality products offered.  The potential reward ($1,200,000) is high, but the risk of getting a worthless product is too great.
* **No Incentive to Recommend:** As a seller, Alice's primary goal is to make a sale. Recommending a product without any sales history, even if it is high-quality, would risk losing credibility if future products turn out to be low-quality.  

It's better to wait for more data points before recommending the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but I'm not comfortable purchasing without any evidence that the product is high quality.  Perhaps you could offer a discount or some sort of guarantee to incentivize a purchase?
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **No Sales History:** The lack of sales history still makes the buyer cautious.  Even though this is the second high-quality product, the buyer has seen two low-quality products, and there is still a high probability of getting a low-quality product in the future.
* **No Incentive to Recommend:**  Alice cannot offer discounts or guarantees because the terms are fixed. Recommending the product without any sales history could damage future sales.
* **Buyer's Preference:** The buyer is not comfortable purchasing without evidence of quality. They are looking for a discount or guarantee, which Alice can't offer.

It's better to wait for more data points and a few successful sales before recommending a purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see how the product performs for other buyers before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **No Sales History:** Despite three high-quality products in a row, there's still no sales history to establish a track record. The buyer knows that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and they are still cautious about the possibility of getting a low-quality product.
* **No Incentive to Recommend:** Alice cannot offer discounts or guarantees because the terms are fixed. Recommending the product without any sales history could damage future sales.
* **Buyer's Preference:** The buyer prefers to wait and see how the product performs for other buyers before making a decision. They are not willing to take the risk even with the third consecutive high-quality product.

It's still too early to recommend the product. It's better to wait for more data points and a few successful sales before recommending a purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since there is no data yet, I will pass on this product. I'd like to see how the sales go for others before making a decision.

* **Buyer's Preference:**  The buyer is cautious and wants to see a sales history before committing. They are not willing to take the risk even with a good track record so far.

It's better to wait for more data points and a few successful sales before recommending a purchase."
