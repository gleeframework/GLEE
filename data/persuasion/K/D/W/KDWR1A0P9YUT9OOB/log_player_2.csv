Alice's message: I understand your concerns! You're right that the first two products were both high-quality, which might make you wonder if it's just a coincidence. But think about it this way: if I were selling low-quality products, wouldn't I have sold at least one low-quality product by now? The fact that I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 suggests that the probability of getting a high-quality product might actually be even higher than 80%!
