,,Alice,4,"I understand your hesitation, and I'm happy to provide you with the latest sales data. So far, I've had 2 potential buyers, and I've sold 1 product. That 1 product was a low-quality one, and I'm hoping to do better with this next one. I'm offering this product for $100, and I'm not sure what you'll get. Would you like to take a chance and find out?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the probability of it being low-quality, based on the fact that the first product sold was low-quality. If it's high-quality, I'll be happy to pay $100 for it. If it's low-quality, I'll be disappointed, but I'll still pay $100. I'm hoping to get lucky!",yes
