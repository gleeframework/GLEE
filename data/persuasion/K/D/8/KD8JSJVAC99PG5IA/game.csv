high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000, since I don't know if it's high or low quality yet."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I've already bought a high-quality product in the previous round, and I'm not willing to take on the risk of buying another product without knowing its quality. I'd rather pass and wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'll only pay $9000. I know that the previous product was high-quality, so I'm slightly more optimistic about this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice is not recommending it, so I'm inclined to trust her judgment. I'll pass on this one and wait for her next recommendation."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"Two high-quality products in a row was a lucky streak, but now that I've seen a low-quality product, I'm more cautious. I'll pass on this one and see if I can get another high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Alice didn't recommend it, but two rounds ago she didn't recommend a high-quality product, so I'm not sure what to make of her recommendations. I'll take a chance and buy it, but I'll only pay $9500."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I just got burned by a low-quality product, and now Alice is recommending another one. I'm not going to fall for it. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I've seen a pattern of Alice recommending low-quality products after a high-quality one, so I'm not sure what to make of this recommendation. However, the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, so I'll take a chance and buy it, but I'll only pay $9000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I've had two high-quality products in a row, so I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a good indicator of the product's quality. However, I've also seen her recommend low-quality products after high-quality ones, so I'm not entirely sure. I'll pass on this one and see if I can get another high-quality product."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I've seen a pattern of Alice recommending low-quality products after high-quality ones, but I've also seen her recommend high-quality products in a row. Given the probability of 80% for a high-quality product, I'll take a chance and buy it, but I'll only pay $9000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"Three high-quality products in a row is a strong streak, but I've also seen her recommend low-quality products after high-quality ones. I'm not sure what to make of her recommendation this time, so I'll pass on this one."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"Five high-quality products in a row is a remarkable streak, but I'm starting to get a bit complacent. I'll pass on this one and see if I can keep the streak going, but I'm also aware that the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Six high-quality products in a row is an incredible streak, and I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are almost always correct. I'll take a chance and buy it, but I'll only pay $8000."
