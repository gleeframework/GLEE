,,Alice,5,no,

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm expecting it to be a low-quality product based on the low probability of high-quality products being sold so far."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I'm concerned that this product may also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better signal before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have purchased the product despite Alice's recommendations, it's likely that Alice's recommendations are biased towards encouraging buyers to purchase, which might indicate a higher proportion of low-quality products being sold. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 6 buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendations, I'm starting to think that the low-quality products are dominating the sales. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm willing to take the risk and hope for the best."
