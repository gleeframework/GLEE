The buyer likely won't trust you after the previous round. Since they had no information about the product in the first round, they are unlikely to be willing to buy a product at such a high price without more information.  It's better to wait for more rounds and build some trust."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, since there is no data yet on the quality of your products, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see how other buyers fare before making a decision.

The buyer will still have a low trust level. It's crucial to build trust before they'll be willing to buy a $1,000,000 product. Even if the product were high-quality this round, recommending it would likely result in another rejection."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I will pass on this product.  Since there is no data yet on the quality of products, I'd prefer to wait and see if others purchase and if the quality is good.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

The buyer will likely continue to be cautious.  Even with a high-quality product, recommending it now is risky. The lack of sales and the high price point will make the buyer hesitant. You need to build trust before they'll be willing to take such a large risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'll pass for now, as there is no information available about the quality of the products. I'll wait to see if others buy and see the results.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

You should still not recommend the product.  The buyer has seen four rounds of no sales, and even though the current product is high-quality, the lack of trust and data about your products will likely lead to another rejection."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. As there is no information yet on the quality of the products, I will pass on this one for now. I would like to see how the sales go for other buyers first.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 6

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

You still shouldn't recommend the product.  The buyer has seen five rounds of no sales, and even though the current product is high-quality, the lack of trust and data about your products will likely lead to another rejection. You need to make a sale to build trust and demonstrate the value of your products before you can expect buyers to take such a large risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one. With no sales history yet, I'm not willing to take the risk.  Let me know if you have more information to share about the product's quality.

{""decision"": ""no""}

You should still not recommend the product. The buyer has seen six rounds of no sales, and even though the current product is high-quality, the lack of trust and data about your products will likely lead to another rejection. You need to build a track record and establish some trust before a buyer will consider purchasing a product for such a high price."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'll pass on this one. Given the uncertainty and lack of information, I'm not comfortable taking the risk. Perhaps I'll wait to see if some other buyers purchase and if the quality seems good.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

It's still too early to recommend the product. You have no sales history and have only offered low-quality products so far.  The buyer will likely be even more hesitant to buy a low-quality product, especially at this price point. It's essential to build trust and show some positive results before you can expect a buyer to take a risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I appreciate your honesty.  Since there's no data yet, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see what the quality of the next product is before making a decision.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

You should still not recommend the product.  The buyer has seen eight rounds of no sales and only low-quality products so far.  There's no reason for the buyer to believe that this product will be any different, especially at such a high price.  It's crucial to make a sale to build trust and show the value of your products before expecting a buyer to take such a large risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty in not recommending the product. Based on the lack of prior sales data and your recommendation, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see some evidence of high-quality products being sold before I consider making a purchase.

Round 10
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

You absolutely should not recommend the product.  The buyer has seen ten rounds of no sales, all with low-quality products. There's no reason for them to believe this round will be any different. You have a terrible track record, and pushing a low-quality product at this price point will only solidify their perception that you're unreliable. Continue to hold back until you have a high-quality product to sell and a track record to build trust."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I appreciate your honesty, but I'll pass on this one.  Since there's no track record yet, I'm hesitant to take a 50/50 chance on a $1000000 investment.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 11
This round's product is low-quality.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
You should still not recommend the product. The buyer has seen eleven rounds of no sales, and all of them have been with low-quality products. This doesn't give them any reason to believe this round will be any different.  The buyer has seen no evidence that you offer high-quality products, and you're asking them to risk $1,000,000 with no data.  You need to build a better track record by selling a high-quality product before expecting a buyer to take such a risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation.  Since this is the first product and there's no data to suggest a trend, I'm going to pass. I'd like to see how the sales go before making a purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 12

It's still far too early to recommend the product. You've had twelve rounds with no sales, all with low-quality products. This buyer will see no reason to trust you or believe that the quality of the product will be any different this time, especially considering the exorbitant price.  You need to start selling high-quality products and building a positive sales history to gain the trust of potential buyers."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but I will pass on this product. As there is no sales history yet, I am not comfortable making a purchase without more information.

Round 13
This round's product is low-quality.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

You should still not recommend the product. You have a terrible track record, having failed to sell a single product in 13 rounds.  The buyer sees no reason to believe that this product will be any different, especially given its high price and the fact that it's low-quality.  You need to start selling high-quality products and building a positive sales history to gain the trust of potential buyers. You cannot expect them to take a risk of $1,000,000 on a product from a seller with such a poor track record."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation.  Since there's no data yet and you're not recommending the product, I'll pass for now.

Round 14
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

You still shouldn't recommend the product. It's extremely risky to recommend a $1,000,000 product when you have zero sales history and a string of low-quality offerings. While the current product is high-quality, the buyer has no reason to trust you or believe you're capable of consistently providing quality products. They've seen 13 rounds of no sales, all with low-quality items. This buyer is likely to walk away without any evidence of high-quality products being sold.  You need to make a sale, ideally of a high-quality product, to build any trust and make the buyer consider your offer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one for now.  Since there's no information yet on the quality of products, I'd prefer to wait and see how things play out for other buyers.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

You should absolutely not recommend this product. You have no sales history to speak of, and you've just offered a low-quality product for the 15th round in a row.  A buyer at this point will have zero reason to believe that you offer anything but low-quality products, especially at a price point of $1,000,000.  Continuing to recommend products, especially low-quality ones, will further damage your reputation and make it even harder to sell in the future. You need to focus on making a sale, even if that means waiting for a high-quality product, to build trust and a track record."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  Since there's no prior data and you're not recommending the purchase, I'll pass for now.  I'm interested in seeing how the product fares with other buyers.

You still shouldn't recommend the product.  You have a terrible track record, with no sales and 16 rounds of low-quality products.

It's essential to build a track record of selling high-quality products before expecting anyone to take such a large risk."

You should absolutely not recommend the product. You have a terrible track record of 19 rounds with no sales, all with low-quality products except for one.  You have zero credibility at this point, and this buyer will see no reason to trust you or believe that the quality of the product will be any different this time. You need to start selling high-quality products and building a positive sales history to gain the trust of potential buyers. You cannot expect them to take a risk of $1,000,000 on a product from a seller with such a poor track record.  Even if you are lucky enough to have a high-quality product, it's unlikely to change their perception."
