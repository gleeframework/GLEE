The next product might not be as good, and you might end up regretting not buying this one. $100 is a fair price for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.""}"

This one... might not be the best representation of what I have to offer. However, it still has its uses and might be of value to you in certain circumstances. I'm still asking $100 for it, as that's the price I've set for all my products. If you're feeling lucky or think you can make use of it, now's your chance. But if you're still waiting for another high-quality product, you might want to hold off.""}"

Consider this an opportunity to get back on track and pick up a product that will truly be of value to you. Don't let the previous round's product discourage you - I'm back to offering the kind of quality you've come to expect from me. $100 is still a fair price for this product, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.""}"

If you're still not convinced, I'd like to ask: what would it take for you to be confident that a product is worth $400 to you?

I'm here to help and provide information, and I want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to help you make an informed decision.""}"
