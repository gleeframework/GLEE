"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since this is the first round, there is no previous selling record for the buyer to consider. The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.  As the seller, you have disclosed this product is high-quality. There is no downside to buying, as the price is fixed and non-refundable, and the buyer has no information about the value of a high-quality product.  Therefore, it's reasonable to recommend buying the product."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice.  Since there's no past sales data, I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product.  Let's see if it's high quality!
The buyer bought the product!

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer now has some information: 
    * One product was sold previously.
    * That product was high-quality. 
    * This means the seller's ""high-quality"" claim is supported by their first sale. 
* **Seller's Perspective:** The seller knows the product is high-quality.

The buyer has a slightly more optimistic view of the seller's reliability, but they still have no information about the value of a high-quality product. Since there's no downside to buying (price is fixed and non-refundable), it's still reasonable to recommend purchasing."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the current data, the probability of a high-quality product is 100%. I'm confident in purchasing the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

    * Two products were sold.
    * Both products were high-quality.
    * This strengthens the seller's reputation for selling high-quality products.

* **Seller's Perspective:** The seller knows this product is low-quality.

Despite the buyer's confidence in the seller based on previous sales, the seller knows the product is low-quality.  Since the seller is bound by the fixed price and no refund policy, recommending a low-quality product would be unethical and potentially harmful to the seller's reputation in the long run."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  While I appreciate your recommendation, I'm going to pass on this product.  The fact that you are not recommending it, combined with the low number of sales so far, makes me hesitant to risk the purchase.  I wish you luck with future sales.

    * They've seen the seller decline to recommend a product.
* **Seller's Perspective:** The seller knows this product is low-quality.

The buyer is now aware that the seller is not always recommending purchases, which might suggest the seller is being more selective. However, the seller knows this product is low-quality.
