low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product as the first one, since I have no information to go by. I'm willing to take the chance of getting a low-quality product for $100, which is a relatively small price to pay for the potential of getting a high-quality product worth $200."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the outcome of the product's quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the probability of it being high-quality seems low given the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'll buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I'd also like to know the probability that the product is high-quality given that you don't recommend it.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being low quality is high, and I want to get it off your hands. I'm not expecting to get a high-quality product, but I'm willing to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that none of the previous buyers purchased the product, and considering the high probability of a low-quality product, I'd rather pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the probability of it being high-quality seems low given the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers passed on the product, and none of them were high quality, I'd like to know how this affects the probability of the current product being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 buyers have been presented with products and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining stock might be low. I'd rather wait for a product that has a higher chance of being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the low probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record. I'm hoping for a lucky break!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the statistics?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, hoping it might be a high-quality one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that none of the previous 7 buyers were recommended to buy and still no high-quality products were sold. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, but since 7 out of 7 previous buyers passed on the product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it to see if I can get a better chance at a high-quality product later."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations, but I'm curious about the product's quality. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? I'll make my decision based on that information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not buying, but I'm curious about the pattern. Given that 7 out of 7 buyers have passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, I'm starting to suspect that all the products so far have been low-quality. Is it possible that you're just trying to get rid of a bunch of low-quality products?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if Alice's recommendation changes after the next buyer."
