,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns about the product's quality. I'd like to assure you that I have sold 0 high-quality products so far, but I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on this high-quality product, which I've just confirmed. I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee' of sorts: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a refund of $500000. This way, you'll only lose $500000 if it's a low-quality product. What do you say?",

I'll also tell you the number of high-quality products I've sold so far, which is 0. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on this high-quality product, which I've just confirmed. If you're still unsure, I can offer to reveal the quality of the next product I have available, but you'll have to buy this one first.",

,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability you're thinking of. Is it 50% or higher? I'm basing my decision on the fact that you're making a recommendation, so I'd like to know if you're leaning towards a high-quality product or not.",yes

,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're willing to take the risk. To answer your question, I'm not making a recommendation based on a specific probability. However, I will say that I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products, which means that 66.67% of my products so far have been high-quality. This might suggest that the next product is more likely to be low-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I'm not guaranteeing its quality.",
