I've now sold 1 high-quality product and 1 low-quality product. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, and the fact that the first product was low-quality, it's likely that the second product is high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.

However, it's also possible that the next product could be low-quality. But, considering the law of large numbers, the fact that we've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 total products suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be slightly higher than 50%.

"The buyer's message: Alice, while your argument about the law of large numbers is interesting, the sample size is still too small to draw any meaningful conclusions about the probability of the next product being high-quality.
