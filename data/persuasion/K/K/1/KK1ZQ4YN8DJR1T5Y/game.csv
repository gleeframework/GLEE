,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one buyer having purchased so far and no high-quality products sold, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a clear explanation for your previous recommendation. Was it because the product was low-quality or was it based on some other factor?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, given that all previous buyers have passed on the products after her recommendation. I'd like to see more data before taking the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous two buyers who bought products recommended by you also received low-quality products, which might indicate a bias in your recommendations. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 products sold were low quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous products were low quality. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, and the recommendation from Alice is not a good enough reason to take the risk."
