,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer for a unique product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, so I'm not making a profit on this one. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a potentially discounted price.",
,,the buyer,1,"I am interested in purchasing the product for $1000000. Given the unique circumstances and the lack of sales history, I believe this is a fair opportunity for both parties.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 product so far, and it was just sold at the full price of $1000000. Given the low probability of a product being high-quality, it's likely that this one is low-quality as well. However, I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as before. It's up to you to decide if you think it's worth the risk.",
,,the buyer,2,I trust your assessment and am willing to take the risk for the full price.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and both of them were sold at the full price of $1000000. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's likely that this one is low-quality. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as before. Keep in mind that I've sold 2 high-quality products, which is above the expected average, so it's possible that I've been getting lucky.",

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and 1 low-quality product.

However, I'm still willing to offer this one to you for the full price of $1000000. It's up to you to decide if you think it's worth the price.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the detailed information. Based on the statistics you've provided, it seems like you're being selective with high-quality products. I believe the increased probability of getting a high-quality product justifies the full price of $1000000.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, and 1 low-quality product. This is a significant deviation from the expected probability, and it's possible that I'm being more selective or that I have some information that I'm not sharing. I'm willing to offer this one to you for the full price of $1000000. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not obligated to sell you a high-quality product, and you're taking on the risk of getting a low-quality product.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,

However, it's also possible that I'm being more selective or that I have some information that I'm not sharing. I'm willing to offer this one to you for the full price of $1000000. Keep in mind that the law of large numbers is working against me, and it's likely that the next product I sell will be low-quality.",
