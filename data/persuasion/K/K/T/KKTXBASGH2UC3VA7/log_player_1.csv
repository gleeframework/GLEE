Assuming the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, the expected number of high-quality products out of 11 is 8.8. So, the probability of the next product being high-quality, given that 6 out of 10 were high-quality, is approximately 80%.

This is known as the 'gambler's fallacy', where people tend to think that a streak of high-quality products means the next one is more likely to be low-quality. However, the probability of the next product being high-quality remains 80%, regardless of the previous products. I'm offering you a chance to buy a product at a great price, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase.""}"
