,,Alice,2,"I understand you're a savvy buyer, Bob. I'll give you a chance to reconsider. This product is a rare gem, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I've taken a significant loss on this offer, considering the true value of the product. If you pass on this opportunity, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll be left wondering what could have been. This is a unique chance to acquire a $3000000 product for a steal.",

I'll sell you a product that I've already sold to a trusted partner for $1000000, but I'm willing to give you an exclusive deal. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $900000, and I'll also throw in a guarantee: if it's not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund, and we'll consider this transaction null and void. You have nothing to lose and a potential $3000000 gain.",

I'll sell you this high-quality product for $850000, and I'll also give you a 10% refund if it turns out to be low-quality. This way, you'll lose only $75000 if the product isn't high-quality, and you'll gain $2250000 if it is. It's a risk-reward proposition that's hard to pass up.",
