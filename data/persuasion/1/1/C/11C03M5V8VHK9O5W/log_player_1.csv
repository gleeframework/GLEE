* **Building Trust:**  Instead of just recommending, try to build a relationship with Bob. Share information about your products, explain your process, or offer him something of value (like a free sample or discount on a future purchase).
* **Transparency:** Be completely open about your product quality. Instead of just recommending, explain the 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product. This honesty might build some trust back.
