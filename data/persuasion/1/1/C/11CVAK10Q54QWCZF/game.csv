I'd like to mention that we've had a successful sale in the previous round, and I'm confident that this product will also bring value to its new owner.

I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. Are you ready to ride the wave of success and make another great purchase?",

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"We've got four high-quality products in a row now! That's a remarkable run. However, I want to emphasize that this is still within the expected probability range.

I'm offering this low-quality product to you for $1000000, which is the same price as the previous two products. I'm curious to know if you'll take the chance to buy at the full price, or if you'll try to negotiate a lower price.",
