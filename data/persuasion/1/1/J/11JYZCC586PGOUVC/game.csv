,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that there are no sales records, I don't have any information about the product's quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any additional information. I'd rather wait for more data to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take a chance, I don't have any prior information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of a product being high-quality, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that 2 buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I will pass on the product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 2, which is 0%. This is consistent with the 50% probability of a product being high-quality. Given the lack of information, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to risk wasting my money."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think your recommendation is based on the fact that all previous products were low-quality, so I'm hoping to be the exception."
