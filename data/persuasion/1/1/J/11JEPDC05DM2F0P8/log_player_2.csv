Alice's message: Understood! I respect your cautious approach. Let me offer some additional context: our first two buyers had a great experience, but I want to emphasize that each product has an 80% chance of being high-quality, regardless of the previous ones.

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad to have you here. I want to be transparent with you - our last product was indeed high-quality, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it. Unfortunately, this one is not. Despite the 80% chance of high-quality, sometimes we get a low-quality product in the mix. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to emphasize that it's not the best representation of our typical product quality. Would you like to take a chance on it, knowing it's not the best?

Alice's message: I understand your concerns! I appreciate your diligence in asking about our quality control process. I can assure you that our products are randomly selected from a pool of high-quality and low-quality items, with an 80% chance of high-quality and 20% chance of low-quality. The streak of high-quality products is just a coincidence, and we can't guarantee that the next product will be high-quality. In fact, this one is not. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to be upfront about the quality. Would you like to take a chance on it, or would you rather wait for the next product?

Alice's message: Great question! I'm happy to provide some insight into our product pool. We have a total of 16 products left, and 4 out of 6 products sold so far have been high-quality. Assuming the same 80% chance of high-quality products, we can estimate that around 12 out of 16 remaining products are high-quality.
