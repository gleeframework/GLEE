Alice's message: Welcome to the next round! With 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, you now know that the seller has a 33.33% chance of offering a high-quality product. However, since the previous product was high-quality, it's possible that the current product might not be. I'm being transparent with you - the seller has sold 1 out of 2 products so far, and only 1 was high-quality. Would you like to take a calculated risk and buy this product for $100, or wait for more information before making a decision?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
