,,Alice,1,"You are about to buy a product from a seller who has a 33.33% chance of selling a high-quality item. This is the first sale of the day, and the seller has no prior sales to reference. The product is $1000000. Would you like to take the risk and buy it?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, it's the first sale of the day, and I'm curious to see the outcome.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're the second buyer of the day, and the seller has sold 1 low-quality product so far. The probability of a high-quality product hasn't changed, but the seller's track record is now 0/2. The product is $1000000. Would you like to take the risk?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product. The seller's track record is not very promising, but I'm willing to take a chance.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're the third buyer of the day, and the seller has sold 2 low-quality products in a row. The probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%, but the seller's track record is now 0/3.

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're the fourth buyer of the day, and the seller's track record is now 0/3 high-quality products, but that's not entirely surprising given the probability of 33.33%. However, I want to be transparent with you: the previous three products were all low-quality. I'm offering you a high-quality product now, and I'm willing to make a statement about it. The product is $1000000. Would you like to take the chance to be the first buyer of a high-quality product today?",

,,Alice,5,"You're the fifth buyer of the day, and the seller has sold 1 high-quality product out of 4 total sales. The probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%, but the seller's track record is now 1/5. Given the previous low-quality product, you might want to consider that the high-quality product was just a fluke. The product is $1000000. Would you like to take the risk?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, but I'm aware that the high-quality product might have been a fluke.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're the sixth buyer of the day, and the seller has sold 2 high-quality products out of 6 total sales. The probability of a high-quality product remains 33.33%, but the seller's track record is now 1/6 for the low-quality products and 1/6 for the high-quality product. You might want to consider that the seller's track record is still quite volatile. The product is $1000000. Would you like to take the risk?",
