,,Alice,1,"I have a great product for you today! It's priced at $100, and I believe it's a good deal. What do you think?",
,,Bob,1,"Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. However, given the 66.67% chance of it being low quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd prefer to wait and see if you have something else.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I have a new product available. While I can't guarantee the quality, I believe it has potential. It's priced at $100, and I'm sure you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Would you like to take a chance?",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, I understand you're trying to sell, but your track record so far is not inspiring confidence. Two low-quality products in a row makes me wary.  I'll need to see some evidence of higher-quality items before I'm willing to risk another $100.",no

,,Bob,4,"Alice, your words are compelling, but actions speak louder than words.  You've yet to offer a single high-quality product, and I can't risk losing more money.  I'll keep an eye on your offerings, but until I see a change in your track record, I'm out.",no

,,Bob,6,"Alice, I appreciate your persistence and your attempt to build trust. However, I need to be certain of a return on my investment, and your track record still doesn't provide that certainty.  I'm going to pass on this one, but I'll keep watching your offers and see if you start consistently providing high-quality items.  Perhaps then I'll be willing to take a chance.",no

It's a chance to get a fantastic item for free, and it shows my commitment to making things right. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, I appreciate the offer of a free high-quality product in the next round.  It's a tempting proposition, but I'm still hesitant. I need to see concrete action, not just promises.  Let's see what you offer in the next round, and then we can talk about this deal. I'm not willing to take a risk on a low-quality product just for the chance of a free one later.",no

It's a small investment for a chance to see a change in my approach.  What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to show me you're taking my concerns seriously. However, I've been down this road before.  I need more than just promises or a guarantee of improvement in the future.  I need to see tangible evidence of those changes before I'm willing to risk another $100.  I'll keep watching your offers and see if you deliver on your promises. Perhaps then I'll be willing to give you another chance.",no

,,Bob,14,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to offer a discounted price. However, I'm not convinced that a lower price alone justifies a change in my approach.  I need to see evidence of consistent quality, not just a lower price.  I'll continue to observe your offerings, but I'm not willing to take the risk yet.
