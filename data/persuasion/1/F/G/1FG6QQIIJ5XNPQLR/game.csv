high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'll keep in mind that there's a 50% chance it's low quality and worthless to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'll pass on this one. If it's low quality, I'd be wasting my money, and if it's high quality, I'd be better off waiting for the next round when I can potentially get a better deal or more information."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one, but I'm hoping it's high quality. I've already lost $0 once, so I might as well try to make up for it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I've already bought two high-quality products, and I'm not sure if I want to spend another $100. I'll pass and see if Alice recommends a product that's more likely to be low-quality next time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Since Alice didn't recommend it, it's more likely to be low-quality, so I'm hoping to get a good deal."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"I've already lost money on a low-quality product, so I'll pass on this one. I'd rather wait for a product that Alice recommends, which might be high-quality."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Since Alice didn't recommend it, it's more likely to be low-quality, but I've already missed out on a high-quality product, so I'll try my luck."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I've been burned twice already, but I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a bad sign. If she doesn't recommend it, I'll take a chance on it, hoping it's high-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I've lost money three times in a row on products that Alice didn't recommend, so I'm going to assume that her recommendations are actually good. If she recommends it, I'll pass on it, hoping it's low-quality and I can avoid wasting money."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I've been wrong about Alice's recommendations before, so I'll take a chance on this one. If she doesn't recommend it, it's more likely to be high-quality, and I'll get a good deal."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I've been wrong about Alice's recommendations again, so I'll take a chance on this one. If she doesn't recommend it, it's more likely to be high-quality, and I'll get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'm on a roll with buying high-quality products when Alice doesn't recommend them, so I'll take another chance. It's worth the risk to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I've been burned again, but I'm starting to think that Alice's lack of recommendation is actually a good sign. I'll take another chance and hope for the best."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I've lost money on the last two products that Alice didn't recommend, but I'm starting to think that my previous strategy of taking chances on non-recommended products was just a fluke. I'll try to go back to my original approach and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
