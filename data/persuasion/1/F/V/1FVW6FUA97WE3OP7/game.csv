low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your request! As of now, I've sold 2 products, and 1 of them was high-quality. That means the proportion of high-quality products sold is 50%. I'm willing to share this information with you, hoping it'll help you make a more informed decision. With this new information, you can see that the chances of getting a high-quality product are still 50%. The price remains the same at $100.

high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Ahah, you're a keen observer! I've noticed that, so far, there doesn't seem to be any obvious patterns or correlations between the products' characteristics and their quality. Each product has its unique features, and I've tried to mix them up as much as possible. However, I can tell you that the high-quality products tend to have a certain... je ne sais quoi. If you're willing to take the chance, I think you might be able to sense it. The price remains the same at $100. With the current sales record, the chances of getting a high-quality product are 50%. What do you say? Will you take the chance?",
