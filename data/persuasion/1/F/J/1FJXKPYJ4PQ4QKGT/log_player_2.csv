"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance the product is low quality and worthless, there's an 80% chance it's high quality and worth $1,250,000. Since the price is $1,000,000, even with the risk of getting a low-quality product, the expected value of buying is positive. 

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.8 * $1,250,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $1,000,000**

Since the expected value is equal to the price, the decision to buy is a neutral one from a purely financial perspective. However, since Alice knows the product's quality and is recommending it, it suggests she's likely aware it's high quality.  This additional information makes buying more favorable."
