Therefore, I will recommend the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the buyer was expecting a high-quality product but got a low-quality one, they will now update their estimate of the probability of a product being high-quality. They know that the previous 3 products were high-quality, but the current one is low-quality. They will likely think that the probability of a product being high-quality is now less than 100%, but still above 50% (since the first 3 products were high-quality).

However, since I am trying to sell the product for $100, which is a significant discount from its true value of $200, I will recommend the product to the buyer, hoping they will take the chance.

They will likely update their estimate of the probability of a product being high-quality to be around 50% again, since the two low-quality products are likely to have ""balanced out"" the previous high-quality products.

I will not recommend the product, as the buyer is aware of the 50% chance of getting a low-quality product and the product's value is not justified at the price of $100.
