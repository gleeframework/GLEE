"The buyer's message: Since you've had 0 high-quality products out of 2 so far, the probability of this one being high-quality doesn't seem convincing enough to justify the $100 price tag, given the 33.33% chance of it being high-quality initially.

"The buyer's message: Although you claim the odds are in my favor, your sales record of 1 high-quality product out of 4 is actually consistent with the expected probability of 33.33% high-quality products. Furthermore, you haven't actually sold any of those 4 products, so I'm the first buyer. I'm not convinced that this product is more likely to be high-quality than the initial probability suggests, so I'll pass.

That's how confident I am in my product.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but since this is the first sale and there's no previous record to back up your claims, I'll have to rely on the given probabilities. With a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality, I'll pass on this one.

It's a low-risk chance to try out a product at a discounted price.""}"

That's a $10 value, just for taking a chance on this high-quality product!""}"
"The buyer's message: Your sales record is not convincing enough to justify the $100 price tag. You said you've sold 1 high-quality product out of 5, but that's actually a 20% success rate, which is lower than the expected 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality.

It's a low-risk opportunity to try out a product at a discounted price.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty, but given that there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality and you've had a rough start, I think I'll pass on this one. I'm not willing to take the risk, especially since the product is worth $0 to me if it's low-quality.

It's a low-risk opportunity to try out a product at a discounted price.""}"
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record to rely on, I'll have to base my decision on the probability of the product being high quality, which is 33.33%. With a value of $125 for a high-quality product and $0 for a low-quality product, the expected value is $41.67 ($125 * 0.3333), which is less than the price you're asking for ($100).

That's right, you can try it out risk-free and see for yourself if it's worth the price.""}"
"The buyer's message: I've noticed that your sales record doesn't match your claim of selling 1 high-quality product out of 6, as the statistics show that no products have been sold yet.

But if you want to take a chance on a product that's probably worthless, be my guest.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take a chance. Since no products have been sold yet, I have no information to base my decision on other than the 33.33% chance of it being high-quality. Given the potential value of $125 for a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk for $100.
