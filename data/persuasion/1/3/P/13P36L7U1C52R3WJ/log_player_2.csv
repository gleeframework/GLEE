Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, I like that! I understand your concerns. Let me put your mind at ease. I've sold 2 out of 2 products so far, and they were both high-quality. However, I'm willing to offer you a special deal on this next product. If you buy it, I'll give you a 100% refund if it turns out to be low-quality. That's right, you'll get your $10000 back if it's not worth anything. But if it is high-quality, you'll get the full $12000 value. It's a risk-free opportunity to try out a product that's likely to be high-quality. What do you think?

Out of the 6 products I've sold so far, 5 of them were high-quality. The only low-quality product was in round 4. Since then, I've sold 2 more high-quality products. I'm willing to offer you a'rebound' deal. The price is still $10000, but I'll throw in a 'quality guarantee'. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a $2000 bonus on top of the refund. That way, you'll get a total of $8000 back. It's a way for me to prove to you that this product is high-quality.
