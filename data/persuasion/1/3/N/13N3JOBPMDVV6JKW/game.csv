,,Alice,2,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product and the fact that 3 out of 3 previous products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that you've recommended against buying, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to assume that the products are likely low-quality.
