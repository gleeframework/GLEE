Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of Value:**  There's an 80% chance the product is high-quality, and Bob knows this.  
* **No Downside to Buying:**  If the product is high-quality, Bob will likely find it valuable. If it's low-quality, he loses $1,000,000.
