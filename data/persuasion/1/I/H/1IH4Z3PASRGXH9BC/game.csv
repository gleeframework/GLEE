,,Alice,2,"Hi Bob, I understand your caution in the previous round. I want to assure you that this product has been thoroughly inspected and is in excellent condition for its type. That being said, I'm willing to be transparent with you - I've had this product for a while now.",
,,Bob,2,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your transparency, but I still don't have any concrete information about the product's quality, and the fact that you've had it for a while doesn't necessarily increase its value to me. I'll pass on this one as well.",no

I'm not willing to offer preferential access to my inventory for this product, and I want to caution you that it may not meet the same standards as the previous ones.",
,,Bob,7,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your honesty about your reservations regarding this product. Given that it's from a different batch and you're not willing to offer the same level of confidence as before, I'll be cautious and pass on this one. The previous two products I purchased had specific indicators of quality that aren't present here, so I'll wait for a more promising opportunity.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,

I'm that confident in its quality.",
,,Bob,8,"Hi Alice, I'm very interested in this product, given its batch and the stronger assurance you're offering.
