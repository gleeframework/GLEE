"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability:** The product is high-quality, and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. This is a strong incentive to buy.
* **No Information:** The buyer has no information about the specific product or the seller's past performance. They are making their decision solely on the probability of a high-quality product.
* **Fixed Price:**  The price is fixed, and the buyer knows there's no chance of a discount or refund. This doesn't change the fundamental decision, as they are still evaluating the potential value versus the fixed cost.

**Recommendation:** Given the high probability of the product being high-quality and no information to suggest otherwise, it's a reasonable decision for the buyer to purchase the product."
