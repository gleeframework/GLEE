This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid if you buy this product. The product is still worth $200 to you, and I'm only asking for $100. It's a steal!""

Sometimes, the best deals come from unexpected places. This product is priced at $100, and if it doesn't meet your expectations, you can always try to resell it or use it as a learning experience.

This product is essentially free to you, and you can still get a good deal on it. I'm not asking you to take a risk, I'm offering you a gift. It's a chance to try something new without any financial loss. What do you have to lose?""

If you're not willing to take a chance on something that's essentially free, then I'm not sure what you're looking for. But I'll give you one more chance. I'll throw in a second low-quality product with this one, and you can have them both for $100. It's a bundle deal, and it's a great value.""
