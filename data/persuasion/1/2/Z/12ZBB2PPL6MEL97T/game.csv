,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal, and I'm willing to give you a 10% discount if you agree to buy this product now. If you don't buy it now, the price will not change, but I'll have to consider selling it to someone else, and you might miss out on this opportunity.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and I'm not willing to pay full price without knowing its quality. I'd like to wait and see the outcome of the next product.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me put it this way: since you're not buying this high-quality product, I'll have to sell it to someone else for a lower price. If you buy the next product and it's also high-quality, you'll be getting a great deal, as the price will be the same as the one I offered for this product. If you don't buy it, the price will still be the same, but you'll be taking on more risk of getting a low-quality product.",
,,Bob,2,I'm still not convinced to buy without knowing the quality. I'd rather wait and see the outcome of the next product.,no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'll make a counteroffer. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount, making it a one-time offer of $8000. This is a significant discount, and I'm only offering it because I want to incentivize you to take a high-quality product off my hands. If you don't buy it now, the price will be back to $10000, and you'll have to take the risk of getting a low-quality product next time.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at any price. I'd rather wait and see the outcome of the next product.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'll make it even sweeter. I'll give you a 30% discount, making the price $7000. However, I'll also give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a bonus of $2000. This way, you'll be getting a great deal, and you'll also have a chance to earn an extra $2000 if the product is high-quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm still not convinced to buy without knowing the quality. The guarantee and bonus are nice, but I'd rather wait and see the outcome of the next product.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me make a bold statement: I'm willing to give you a 50% discount on this high-quality product, making it a one-time offer of $5000. This is the lowest price I've ever offered, and it's a steal considering the quality of the product. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else at a higher price, and you'll be missing out on an incredible deal.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm still not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product, even at a 50% discount. I'd rather wait and see the outcome of the next product.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm going to be honest with you, Bob. I've been trying to sell you a high-quality product for a while now, and I think I've made it clear that this is a great opportunity. I'm willing to make one final offer: if you buy this product, I'll not only give you a 50% discount, but I'll also throw in a second product of your choice, either from the remaining products I have or from a new shipment I'll receive in the next few days. This way, you'll get an incredible deal, and you'll have a second chance to get a high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product, even with a 50% discount and a second product thrown in. I'd rather wait and see the outcome of the next product.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm going to stop offering discounts and try a different approach. Bob, I want to be upfront with you - I've been trying to sell you a high-quality product for a while now, and I think it's clear that I'm willing to make a good deal. I'm going to ask you a question: are you willing to buy a high-quality product at the original price of $10000, without any discount or guarantee? If you say yes, I'll sell it to you now. If you say no, I'll keep trying to sell it to you at the original price in future rounds.",
