,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, since Alice is not recommending it, which might indicate it's a low-quality product."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, since Alice is not recommending it, which might indicate it's a low-quality product. But I have to consider that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I'll pass on this one. Alice's recommendation is suspiciously consistent with her previous behavior when she recommended a low-quality product, so I'll err on the side of caution."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. Alice's lack of recommendation is consistent with her previous behavior when the product was low-quality, but the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. Alice's lack of recommendation is consistent with her previous behavior when the product was low-quality, and I still have a 80% chance of it being high-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I'm extremely skeptical of Alice's recommendation. Given her previous behavior, I think she's trying to trick me into buying a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"I'm not falling for it. Alice's recommendation is too convenient, and I think she's trying to manipulate me. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'll take the chance and buy the product. Alice's recommendation is consistent with her previous behavior when the product was high-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"I'm not going to fall into the same trap again. I'll pass on this one. Alice's recommendation is too predictable, and I think she's trying to get me to buy another high-quality product at a high price."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. Alice's lack of recommendation is consistent with her previous behavior when the product was low-quality, but I'm starting to think she's just consistently recommending low-quality products. I'll take the risk and buy it."

,,Alice,17,no,
