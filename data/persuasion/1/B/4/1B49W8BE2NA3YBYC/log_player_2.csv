Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""} 
```

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""} 
```

Alice's recommendation is valuable information. While the odds are still against us, a recommendation from Alice suggests she might have seen something that indicates this product is likely to be high-quality. Given the potential reward of $200, it's worth the risk this time."
