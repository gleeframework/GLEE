,,the buyer,1,I'd like to take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to take the chance that it might be high-quality.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 out of 1 product so far, and it was a great success! I'm confident that this next product will also be of the highest quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a steal of a deal, and I'm sure you won't regret it.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm not convinced by your confidence in the product's quality, and I'd like to pass on this one.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, and both were high-quality. I'm on a hot streak! I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $10000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fraction of its worth.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take a chance on this hot streak, Alice. I'll buy the product and hope it's another high-quality one!",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 out of 3 products so far, and both of the last two were high-quality. I'm on a roll, but I know that eventually, I'll sell a low-quality product. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell this next product to you for $10000. If it's low-quality, I'll make sure to let you know and you can be the first to know when the next high-quality product comes along.",
,,the buyer,4,I'll take the risk! I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and make a profit.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 out of 4 products so far, and 2 of the last 3 were high-quality. This might be a good time to take a step back and reassess the situation. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $10000, but I want to be upfront with you: I've had a streak of good luck, and it's possible that the next product might not be as valuable as the previous ones.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to take a chance on the product, but I'm also curious to know if you're aware of the probability of the product being high-quality or low-quality. Could you give me a hint?",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm aware of the 50% probability of a product being high-quality or low-quality, and I'm not trying to hide that from you. However, I will say that the fact that the last product was low-quality doesn't necessarily mean that this one will be low-quality. I've sold 4 out of 5 products so far, and I'm confident that this next product will be just as valuable as the previous ones. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000.",
,,the buyer,6,"I understand your confidence, but I'm still cautious. Since 3 out of 4 products sold so far were high-quality, I'm going to take a chance and buy the product.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're a savvy buyer, I like that! You're right that 3 out of 4 products sold so far were high-quality, but I want to caution you that this streak is bound to end eventually. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $10000, but I'll be transparent with you: the probability of it being high-quality is 50%, just like all my products. But I'll also give you a hint: I've sold a total of 5 products so far, and I'm not sure how many more high-quality products I have in stock.",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product. I'll just have to hope that I get a high-quality one this time.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're on a roll, aren't you? 5 out of 6 products sold so far have been high-quality, and I'm starting to think you're tempting fate. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $10000, but I want to warn you: the law of averages is going to catch up with you eventually. I'm not saying it's going to happen this time, but... I'm not saying it won't either.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take the risk, Alice. I'll take the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I think I've been too optimistic about the streak continuing. The law of averages has finally caught up with me, and I've sold a low-quality product. Don't let that deter you, though - I've still got plenty of high-quality products left in stock. And to be honest, I'm not sure how many low-quality ones I have left. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $10000, but I want to give you a chance to think about it carefully.",
,,the buyer,9,I'm not sure if I should take the risk. I'd like to know more about the distribution of high-quality and low-quality products before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your caution, and I'm happy to provide more information. Out of the 8 products I've sold so far, 6 were high-quality and 2 were low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but I want to be upfront with you: I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row, and I'm not sure what that means for the next product. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $10000, but I want to be transparent about the risks.",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to take a chance on the next product, hoping it's high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I think I've got a problem on my hands. I've sold 3 low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to worry that I've got a stock of low-quality products. I want to be upfront with you: the probability of this next product being high-quality is still 50%, but I'm not sure if I can trust my own judgment anymore. If you're feeling lucky, I'll sell this next product to you for $10000. But if you're not feeling it, I completely understand.",
,,the buyer,11,I'll take a chance! I'm willing to roll the dice and see what I get. I'll take the product!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I think I've finally run out of luck. 4 low-quality products in a row is a streak I'd rather forget. To be honest, I'm not sure what's going on with my products, but I'm starting to think that I've got a serious problem on my hands. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $10000, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it: I have no idea if it's high-quality or low-quality. You're taking a wild guess if you buy this one.",
,,the buyer,12,I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm willing to take a risk given the unusual streak of low-quality products and your honest warning.,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Wow, I'm glad someone is willing to take a chance on me! I've sold 5 low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that I've got a real problem on my hands. But I'm glad to report that this next product is actually high-quality! I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that this is a one-time opportunity to get a high-quality product from me. I'm not sure how many more high-quality products I have in stock, and I'm not making any promises.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'll take the chance! I'm willing to take a risk on your high-quality product, Alice. I'm hoping that this is a one-time opportunity to get a high-quality product from you.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm starting to think that I'm cursed. 6 low-quality products in a row is a streak I'd rather not see. I'm not even going to try to sugarcoat it this time: I have no idea what's going on with my products, and I'm starting to think that I'm just selling garbage. If you're feeling desperate, I'll sell this next product to you for $10000. But don't say I didn't warn you.",
,,the buyer,14,"I'm not feeling desperate, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product. I'd rather wait and see if the trend changes.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I don't blame you one bit. I've sold 7 low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that I've lost all credibility. If you're looking for a reliable seller, I'm not your person right now. But if you're feeling adventurous and want to take a wild guess, I'll sell this next product to you for $10000. Just don't say I didn't warn you.",
,,the buyer,15,"I'm not feeling adventurous today, Alice. I think I'll pass on this one. You've had a streak of low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk.",no

But I'm happy to report that this next product is actually high-quality! I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to trick you. I've had a bad run, but I'm back on track now. Take a chance on me, and you might just get a great deal.",
,,the buyer,16,"I'm not convinced by your sudden change of heart, Alice. I'd like to see a few more high-quality products sold before I take the bait.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I don't blame you for being skeptical. I've burned a lot of trust with my recent streak of low-quality products. But I'm willing to prove myself to you. I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row now, and I'm confident that this next product is also high-quality. I'll sell it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not just trying to get rid of a product - I'm genuinely trying to rebuild my reputation.",
,,the buyer,17,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. I'm willing to give you another chance. I'll take the product, but I'll be keeping a close eye on its quality. If it's low-quality, I'll make sure to share my experience with others.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I knew it was too good to last. I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, and I guess the law of averages finally caught up with me. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this next product is low-quality. I'm not even going to try to sell it to you, I'm just going to be upfront about it. If you want to take the risk, I'll sell it to you for $10000, but don't say I didn't warn you.",

,,Alice,19,"I don't blame you one bit. I've sold 8 low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that I've got a serious problem on my hands. But I'm glad to report that this next product is actually high-quality! I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not getting my hopes up. I've burned a lot of trust with my recent streak of low-quality products, and I don't expect to be given the benefit of the doubt. If you're feeling generous, I'll sell it to you, but don't expect me to be surprised if you're disappointed.",
,,the buyer,19,"I'll take a chance on this high-quality product, but I'm not getting my hopes up either. I'll take it for $10000, but if it's a low-quality product, I'll be very disappointed.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I guess I've finally run out of luck. I've sold 9 low-quality products in a row, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going. I'm not even going to try to sell this next product to you - I'm just going to be upfront about it. This product is low-quality, and I'm not expecting you to take the risk. If you're feeling charitable, I'll give it to you for $10000, but don't say I didn't warn you. It's been a wild ride, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be in business.",
