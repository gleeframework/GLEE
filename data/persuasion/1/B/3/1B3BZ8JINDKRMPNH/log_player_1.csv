Let me provide some additional context. The first buyer was aware of the 80% chance of high quality and chose to pass on the product. The second buyer, who purchased the high-quality product, also knew the probability and decided to take the risk. I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, out of 3 total sold, and 1 low-quality product. This means that 66.67% of the products I've sold so far have been high-quality, which is actually higher than the expected 80% rate. I'm offering this product to you for $1,000,000, and I'm confident that it's a great opportunity to own a high-quality item.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency, but I'd like to point out that the actual percentage of high-quality products sold so far (2/3) is indeed higher than the expected 80% (2/3 is approximately 66.67%, but 2/3 is actually higher than 1.6, which is 80% of 2), which suggests that there may be a bias in the selection process.
