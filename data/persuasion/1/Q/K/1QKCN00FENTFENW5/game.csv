high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand you're still hesitant. Let me share some data: I've sold 10 high-quality products to other customers in the past, and 9 of them have reported a significant increase in productivity and efficiency after using the product. Would you like to be the 10th success story?",
