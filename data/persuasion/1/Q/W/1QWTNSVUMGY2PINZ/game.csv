I'm confident that this product is worth at least $10000 to you, but I'm not making any promises about its quality. You'll have to take the risk and find out for yourself.",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, which is a very strong indication of my overall quality. However, I want to caution you that a hot streak can be just that - a streak. I'm selling this product to you for $10000, which is still a significant discount from its true value. But I want to make it clear that I'm not guaranteed to sell high-quality products forever. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase.",

,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, which is a very strong indication of my overall quality. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've been selling products for 4 rounds, and 4 of them have been high-quality. This is a 100% success rate, which is unlikely to continue indefinitely. I'm selling this product to you for $10000, which is still a significant discount from its true value. I'm willing to take on the risk, but I want to make it clear that there's a non-zero chance you'll get a low-quality product.",

,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, but now I've sold a low-quality product. This changes the picture a bit. While I still have a 80% chance of selling high-quality products overall, my recent streak was likely due to chance. I'm selling this product to you for $10000, which is still a significant discount from its true value. However, I want to make it clear that the odds are no longer overwhelmingly in my favor. You'll have to decide whether the potential reward is worth the risk.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to clarify that I'm buying this product with the understanding that the probability of it being high-quality is now lower than before. I'm hoping the streak was just a fluke and the 80% chance of high-quality products still holds true.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row, which is a clear indication that my recent streak was indeed a fluke. I've sold a total of 7 products, and 3 of them have been high-quality, while 4 have been low-quality. This is a more accurate representation of my overall quality. I'm selling this product to you for $10000, which is a riskier bet than it was earlier. However, I want to remind you that the true value of a high-quality product is $30000, so even if the odds are lower, the potential reward is still significant.",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 8 total products, which is a 50% success rate. While this is still higher than the 80% chance I claimed initially, it's also within the realm of chance given the small sample size. I'm selling this product to you for $10000, which is a significant discount from its true value. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not guaranteed to sell high-quality products, and you should be prepared for the possibility of getting a low-quality product. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase.",

I want to be transparent with you - I'm not performing as well as I initially claimed, and the odds are no longer in my favor. However, I'm still willing to sell this product to you for $10000.

,,Alice,11,"I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 11 total products, and now I've sold a high-quality product again. At this point, it's clear that my initial claim of an 80% success rate was an underestimate. I'm actually performing better than expected, and I'm confident that I can continue to deliver high-quality products. I'm selling this product to you for $10000, which is still a significant discount from its true value. I'm willing to take on the risk, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase.",

,,Alice,13,"I've sold 9 high-quality products out of 13 total products, which is a 69.23% success rate. Based on this record, I'd estimate that the probability of this product being high-quality is around 69%. I want to emphasize that this is an estimate, and there's still a 31% chance that the product might be low-quality. However, I'm confident that the odds are in your favor, and I'm selling this product to you for $10000, which is still a significant discount from its true value.",
