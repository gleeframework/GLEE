**Reasoning:**

* **Prior probability:** The product has an 80% chance of being high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice has a vested interest in selling products, so her recommendation is not neutral. However, she likely has some information about the product's quality that we don't. 
* **Limited data:**  The data available is limited, with only one previous sale.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential payoff of a high-quality product is significant.

**Overall:** It is a gamble, but the odds seem to be in our favor. The potential reward outweighs the risk given the available information."

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows that 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This is a very strong indicator that Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further strengthens the case for buying. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $120 outweighs the risk of getting $0, especially given the high success rate so far."

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, as the seller, has an incentive to make recommendations that lead to sales. Since she recommends buying, it's likely she believes the product is high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0)."
