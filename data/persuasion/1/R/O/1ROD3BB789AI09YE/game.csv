,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the next round! I'm glad to hear that the previous buyer was satisfied with their purchase.

This one is also a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for the same price of $1000000. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity to own a high-quality item?",

,,Alice,3,"You're right that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%! However, I'd like to point out that I've now sold 2 high-quality products in a row. This is a remarkable coincidence, don't you think? I'm offering you this third high-quality product for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to own not one, not two, but three high-quality items. Would you like to take a chance and make it yours?",

I'm offering it to you for the same price of $1000000, but I want to be upfront with you - this one has a lower chance of being high-quality. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",

As you know, I've now sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total sales, which is a 75% success rate. I'm offering this one to you for the same price of $1000000.
