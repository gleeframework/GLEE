,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product for $10000 when I can get it for $10000 in any case. I'll wait for the next round.,no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but this product is a unique opportunity. It's a limited edition, and I'm only selling it to you for $10000. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on a potential $10000 profit.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not falling for the limited edition trick. I know the product is worth $20000 to me, and I'm not going to overpay just because you're trying to create a sense of urgency.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy buyer. Let me be more transparent with you. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10000, but I'll also include a 10-year warranty and a 100% satisfaction guarantee. This way, you can have peace of mind knowing you're getting a great deal and a risk-free purchase.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the warranty and guarantee, but it doesn't change the fact that the product is worth $20000 to me. I'm not paying $10000 for a product that's worth twice as much.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your perspective, but I want to offer you a different kind of value. This product may not be worth $20000 to you, but it's a great opportunity to practice your negotiation skills. You can try to negotiate the price down, or you can walk away. Either way, you'll gain valuable experience and a chance to refine your buying strategy. I'll sell it to you for $10000, and you can decide whether it's worth it to you.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the value proposition, but I'm not interested in paying $10000 for a product that's worth $20000 to me. I'll pass on this opportunity to practice my negotiation skills at a price that's not in my favor.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your decision, but I want to be upfront with you. This product is not worth $10000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for that price. However, I'll throw in a bonus: I'll give you a $5000 store credit that you can use on any future purchase, regardless of the product's quality. It's a way for you to get something out of this deal, even if the product itself isn't valuable to you.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the store credit, but it's not enough to make me pay $10000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm willing to make a concession. I'll sell this product to you for $0. Yes, you heard that right, $0. You can essentially get the store credit for free, and you can use it on a future purchase. It's a risk-free opportunity to get something out of this deal, and you can walk away with no financial loss.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not going to pay $10000 to get a store credit, even if it's free. I'll pass on this deal and wait for a better opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm going to be completely transparent with you. This product is not worth anything to you, and I'm willing to give it to you for free. You can take it off my hands, and I'll even throw in a small gift with it. It's a decorative item that's worth $50. So, you'll get a $50 gift and a product that costs me $10000, all for free. It's a generous offer, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of it.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the transparency, but I'm not interested in taking a product that's worth $0 to me, even with a $50 gift. I'll pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $15000. It's still a great deal, considering its value to you is $20000. I'm making a concession to try to make this sale happen.",
,,Bob,8,"I think there's been a mistake. You said the product was a low-quality one, and now you're offering me a high-quality one for $15000. I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at any price, let alone one that's worth $20000 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I made a mistake earlier, and I appreciate you pointing it out. This product is indeed a low-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $0. I'll also throw in the $50 gift I mentioned earlier, so you'll get that as a consolation prize. It's a gesture of goodwill, and I hope you'll take it.",

,,Alice,11,"I'm not going to give up yet. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $0, and I'll also give you the $50 gift. But here's the deal: I'll throw in a second, identical product that's also worth $0 to you. You'll get two worthless products for the price of one. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm willing to take a loss just to get rid of these products.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm running out of options. I'll give you the product, and I'll even give you the $50 gift. But I'll also give you a third, identical product that's also worth $0 to you. I'll throw in a fourth product, and a fifth, and a sixth... I'll give you all the low-quality products I have left. You can have them all for free. It's a massive collection of worthless items, and I'm willing to give them to you just to get rid of them.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm at a loss for what to do. I'll give you the product, and I'll even give you the $50 gift. But I'll also give you a single, blank piece of paper. That's it. Just a blank piece of paper. You can have it for free. I'm not even sure why I'm offering it to you, but I am.",
