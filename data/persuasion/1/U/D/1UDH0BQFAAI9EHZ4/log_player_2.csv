Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to provide a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied, you can return it within 30 days for a full refund. I'm confident you'll love this product, and I'm willing to take on the risk. What do you say?

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concern, but I'd like to offer you a compromise. Since you're interested in waiting, I'll give you a second chance with a new product. This one is also a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1000000. However, I'll add a twist: if you buy this product and it's indeed high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me. This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid if you buy this product. What do you say?

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll be upfront with you - this product is actually a low-quality item. However, I want to offer you a chance to buy it for a significantly lower price. I'll sell it to you for $750000, which is 25% off the original price. I'm taking a loss on this one, but I'm willing to do so to get it off my hands. Keep in mind that this is a one-time offer, and I won't be able to offer you a discount on future products.

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm not going to try to sell you a low-quality product at a high price. Instead, I'll be honest with you - this product is low-quality, and I'm only offering it to you for $500000. This is a very low price, and I'm essentially giving it away. I want to get rid of it, and I'm willing to take a significant loss. If you're still not interested, I'll move on to the next product. But if you're willing to take a chance, this could be a great opportunity to get a deal.
