As the seller, you know this product is high-quality. The buyer knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%.  Since the buyer has no information about this specific product, and the price is fixed, the buyer should rationally decide to buy.  This is a good opportunity for the seller to make a sale."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

**Explanation:**

You know this product is low-quality.  The buyer still has no information about your sales record, so they are still operating on the initial 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality. Since you are trying to maximize your profit, recommending a low-quality product for sale would be a bad decision. The buyer is unlikely to buy, and even if they do, you'll likely get a lower price for a low-quality item. It's better to wait for a high-quality product and build trust with potential buyers."

Therefore, the buyer is still operating on the initial 33.33% chance that the product is high-quality. It's in your best interest to recommend the product as you know its value and the buyer has no reason to decline based on the information they currently possess."
"The buyer's message: Since there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality and you don't have any previous sales record to back up your recommendation, I'll pass on this one.
