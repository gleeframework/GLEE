,,Alice,3,"I've had two previous buyers who were too cautious to make a purchase. My sales record currently stands at 0 sales out of 2 products offered.

Keep in mind that each product is independent, and the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product still applies to this one. Will you be the one to get lucky?",

Will you be the one to finally get a high-quality product and break the streak?",
,,the buyer,6,"Given the information provided, I'll take a pass on this product. While the odds are still 33.33% in my favor, the fact that none of the previous three buyers received a high-quality product doesn't give me confidence in this one. I'll wait for a better opportunity.",no
