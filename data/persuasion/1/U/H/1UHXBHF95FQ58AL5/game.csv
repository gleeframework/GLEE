low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, as there is no prior data to influence my decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your past recommendations, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it to me might be influenced by the fact that none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product. If there's a bias in your recommendations based on the previous sales data, it might be better for me to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Given that 0 out of 3 products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability might be lower than the initial 33.33%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the products Alice recommends are likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information or try to negotiate a better price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is against the product. I'm trying to exploit the fact that Alice knows the true quality of the product and I don't, and I'm hoping that her recommendation is based on the fact that the product is low quality. I'm essentially trying to take advantage of her information asymmetry."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product, given that you've recommended against it, it's likely to be a low-quality product and I can save $10000"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm not convinced by the recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the statistics. Can you provide the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and all of them passed, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered given the statistics."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one and hope that the 8th product is high-quality."
