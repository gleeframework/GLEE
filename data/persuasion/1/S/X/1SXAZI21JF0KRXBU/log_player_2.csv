Alice's message: Hello! I understand your hesitation, but I'd like to assure you that my products are still a great opportunity. Since you're considering the risk, I'll share that the previous buyer who took the risk got a product that wasn't high-quality. However, I'm still confident in my products and believe that the chances of getting a high-quality product are 50%. I'm asking for $1000000 for this product, and I'm willing to take the risk with you. Will you join me on this adventure and buy this product?
