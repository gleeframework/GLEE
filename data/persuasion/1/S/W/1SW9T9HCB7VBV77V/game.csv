However, I must disclose that I don't have any information that would suggest this current product is of high quality. I'll let you make your own decision based on the data I've provided.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take a chance on the current product, given the high proportion of high-quality products in your previous sales record. I'm aware that this product's quality is unknown, but I'm willing to take the risk.",yes

I want to be upfront with you about the product's quality, so you can make an informed decision.",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given that 4 out of 5 products were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the next product will also be high-quality.

,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your transparency and commitment to sharing the product's quality. However, I'd like to point out that the 80% chance of a high-quality product seems to be a general probability, and your specific method for identifying high-quality products may not be 100% reliable. I'm concerned that I might end up with a low-quality product, which would be a waste of my $10000. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product might have a higher chance of being high-quality.",no

I'll continue to work hard to maintain this level of quality and transparency.",
,,the buyer,11,"I appreciate your transparency about your selection process, Alice. However, I'm a bit concerned that your current streak of high-quality products might be too good to be true.

,,Alice,13,"I'm glad you pointed out the discrepancy. Upon reviewing my records, I realized that the initial buyers were more cautious and didn't buy some of the high-quality products I offered. This means that the proportion of high-quality products sold is indeed higher than the overall proportion of high-quality products I've offered. Out of the 12 products I've offered so far, 10 were high-quality and 2 were low-quality. This current product is indeed high-quality.
