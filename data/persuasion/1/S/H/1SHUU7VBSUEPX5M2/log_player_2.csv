**Explanation:**

* **High probability of high-quality:** Since Alice recommended the product, and the seller's record shows a high-quality product has been sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is significantly higher than 50%. 
* **Potential profit:** Even if the product is low-quality, you lose nothing as it's worth $0 to you.  If it's high-quality, you make a $20 profit.
* **Limited availability:** The product is discarded if you pass, meaning you might miss out on the potential profit.

Therefore, the best decision is to buy the product."

* **Value Proposition:**  Even though there's always a 50% chance of a low-quality product, the potential payoff of $120 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product."
