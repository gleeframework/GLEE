I'm offering this product to you for $10,000, and I'm confident that it's a fair value considering the potential reward. We've had 4 potential buyers see the product so far, and the probability of a high-quality product remains 50%.""}"

The probability of a high-quality product remains 50% with each new sale. I'm offering this product to you for $10,000, and I'd like to highlight that this is a one-time opportunity to potentially acquire a high-quality product at a fixed price. We've had 5 potential buyers see the product so far, and I'm confident that you'll make an informed decision.""}"
"The buyer's message: I understand that each product is an independent event, but I'd like to point out that the probability of a high-quality product is not 50% for me, but rather 0% based on the current sales record. I'm willing to take the risk, but I need to ask: can you provide more information about the products that were seen by the previous 4 buyers? Were they all low-quality products, or was there a mix?

The probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, and I'm offering this new product to you for $10,000. I'd like to highlight that the fact that the previous buyer acquired a high-quality product doesn't affect the probability of this new product being high-quality.

I'm offering this new product to you for $10,000, and I believe it's a fair value considering the potential reward. As you can see, the probability of a high-quality product remains 50%, and I'm confident that this one is a great opportunity.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced that the low sale rate of high-quality products is just a coincidence.

They both took a calculated risk and were rewarded with high-quality products.

I'm offering it to you for $10,000, and I believe it's a great opportunity to potentially acquire a valuable item.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your argument.

I'd like to highlight that this is still within the expected range, given the overall probability of a high-quality product being 50%. I'm offering this new product to you for $10,000, and I believe it's a great opportunity to potentially acquire a high-quality item. I'd also like to point out that the fact that we've had multiple high-quality products sold now suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is indeed 50%.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not convinced that the proportion of high-quality products sold is representative of the overall probability. With only 3 high-quality products sold out of 11, the sample size is still relatively small. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
