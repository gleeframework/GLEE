,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'll take the risk and hope it's high quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the recommendation seems biased towards selling. I'd like to see more sales data before making a decision."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is relatively low. Given the low probability of the product being worth $4000000 to me, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."
