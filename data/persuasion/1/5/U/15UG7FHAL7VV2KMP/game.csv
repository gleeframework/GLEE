,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in buying a high-quality product. This one is indeed high-quality, as you can see now. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. I want to make a deal, so I'll sweeten the offer: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll offer you a 'discount' on the next product, which will be revealed as high-quality or low-quality. The discount will be 10% off the price of that next product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the high-quality product, but I want to clarify that the discount offer is only valid if the next product is indeed high-quality. If the next product is low-quality, I'll pass on the discount and buy the next high-quality product at the full price.",yes

If it's high-quality, you can buy it at the full price of $1000000. If it's low-quality, I'll give you a 5% discount on the next high-quality product. What do you say?",
