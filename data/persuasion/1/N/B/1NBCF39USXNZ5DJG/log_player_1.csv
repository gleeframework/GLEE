I've had 19 previous products: the first one was high-quality but didn't sell, the second one was low-quality and sold, the third one was high-quality and sold, the fourth one was low-quality and sold, the fifth one was high-quality but didn't sell, the sixth one was low-quality but didn't sell, the seventh one was high-quality and sold, the eighth one was high-quality and sold, the ninth one was high-quality and sold, the tenth one was low-quality and sold, the eleventh one was high-quality and sold, the twelfth one was low-quality and sold, the thirteenth one was high-quality and sold, the fourteenth one was low-quality and sold, the fifteenth one was low-quality and sold, the sixteenth one was high-quality and sold, the seventeenth one was high-quality and sold, the eighteenth one was low-quality and sold, and the nineteenth one was high-quality and sold. As for the current product, I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is the final round of sales, and I want to assure you that the probability of the product being high-quality remains 50%, just like in all previous rounds. Each product is independent, and the probability is not affected by the previous sales record. Please consider this information and the potential value of the product, and make an informed decision about whether to purchase it. The potential value of a high-quality product is $3000000, but there is also a risk of a low-quality product. This is your last chance to participate in this sales experiment.""}"
