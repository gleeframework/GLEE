This is the final round of sales, and I want to assure you that the probability of the product being high-quality remains 50%, just like in all previous rounds. Each product is independent, and the probability is not affected by the previous sales record. Please consider this information and the potential value of the product, and make an informed decision about whether to purchase it. The potential value of a high-quality product is $3000000, but there is also a risk of a low-quality product. This is your last chance to participate in this sales experiment.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I understand that the probability of the product being high-quality remains 50% and that each product is independent. However, based on your sales record, it appears that the ratio of high-quality products sold to total products sold is roughly 9/16, which is above the expected 50%. Nevertheless, considering the potential value of a high-quality product ($3000000) and the fixed price of $1000000, I believe the expected value is still in my favor. Therefore, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product.""}"
