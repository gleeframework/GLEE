**Reasoning:**

* **The track record is perfect:** 12 buyers, 12 high-quality products sold.  This suggests a very high likelihood (though not guaranteed) that the product Alice is recommending is also high-quality. 
* **Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further reinforces the positive outlook.  While we can't be certain, the odds are strongly in our favor.
* **Potential Loss vs. Potential Gain:**  Passing would mean missing out on a potentially valuable product. While there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $10,000 (buying a high-quality product for $10,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product."
