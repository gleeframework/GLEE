"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality, and the buyer knows that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, there's a good chance the buyer will value it.  There's no downside for you to recommend it, as the price is fixed, and you're not offering a discount. 

**Strategy:**

In the early rounds, it's best to recommend the product whenever it's high-quality to build a good reputation.  This will encourage buyers to trust your recommendations in the future."
