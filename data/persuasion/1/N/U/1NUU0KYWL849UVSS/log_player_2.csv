"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have no information to go on other than Alice's recommendation, and Alice knows the quality of the product, it's in your best interest to trust her recommendation. You are guaranteed a profit if the product is high quality and lose nothing if it's low quality."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your input, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a clear incentive to recommend products that will benefit her (i.e., you buying them). Since she's *not* recommending this product, it's likely because it's low quality.  While there's always a chance it's high quality, the risk of losing $10,000 outweighs the potential $2,000 profit."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alright, I'll trust your recommendation again, Alice.  Let's do this!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record is 1 for 1. Even though she's not always right, she has proven she can identify good products. It's still a gamble, but the potential profit of $2,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

```

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record is now 3 for 2, making her a pretty reliable source of information. However, her not recommending a product suggests it's likely low quality.
