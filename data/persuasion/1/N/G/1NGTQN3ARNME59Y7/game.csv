,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the statistics. With 4 buyers having passed on the products and 0 high-quality products sold, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being sold has decreased.

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the probability of this product being high-quality seems low."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure about the product's quality, but I've noticed that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product. Alice's recommendation not to buy is also a red flag. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer has a better intuition."

,,Alice,12,yes,
