low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take it, since you're not recommending it, it's probably low quality, and I can avoid the cost of $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take it, since you're not recommending it, and there's a 66.67% chance it's low quality, which would mean I only lose $1000000. The potential upside of it being high quality is still worth the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take it, since you're not recommending it, and the probability of it being low quality hasn't changed. I've already lost $2000000 on the first two products, so I'm getting more cautious and will just take the chance that it's low quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I've learned that Alice is not recommending high-quality products, but I still have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product if I buy it. The potential loss is still $1000000, but the potential gain is $2000000. I'll take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"I've lost $4000000 so far, and the pattern is clear: Alice is not recommending high-quality products. I'll pass on this one, and hope that she'll recommend a high-quality product in the next round."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I've learned that Alice never recommends high-quality products, and I've lost $4000000 on 4 low-quality products. I'll take the chance and buy this one, since I know it's definitely low quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I've lost $5000000 so far, and I know the product is low quality, but I'll take it since I'm not losing any more money by buying it, and I'm trying to get a sense of when Alice might recommend a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"I've lost $6000000 so far, and the pattern is clear: Alice never recommends high-quality products. I'll pass on this one, since I know it's definitely low quality, and I'm trying to minimize my losses."

,,Bob,13,no,"I've lost $7000000 so far, and the pattern is still clear: Alice never recommends high-quality products. I'll pass on this one, since I know it's definitely low quality, and I'm trying to minimize my losses."
