,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality product worth $1200000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 16.7% discount from its true value. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns about the price. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'm willing to offer you a new deal. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $1050000, which is a 12.5% discount from its true value. I'll also offer you a 50% chance to buy another high-quality product at the same price in the next round, if you decline this one. What do you say?",

What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the current product at $1050000, but I'm not committing to buying the future products yet. I'd like to see how the next two rounds play out before making any further decisions.",yes

I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $1050000, and I'll also offer you a 75% chance to buy the next product at the same price.
