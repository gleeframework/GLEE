high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, there's only one high-quality product sold out of one product sold, which suggests a 100% success rate for high-quality products. However, given the small sample size, I'm not convinced that this is representative of the overall population. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk based on the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, I'm not convinced that the product is high quality, but I'm hoping to get lucky."

,,Alice,13,yes,

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the statistics. I know that 2 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and actually bought high-quality products. The probability of the product being high quality is 80%, but the probability that I'll get a high-quality product given that I'm being recommended to pass is lower. I'm taking a risk, but I'll go for it."
