"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As a seller, you are aiming to maximize your profits. In the first round, you know the product is high-quality. You have no information about the buyer's valuation of high-quality products.  However, since the buyer is aware of the 50% chance of a high-quality product, there's a chance they will value it enough to pay $10,000. It's a gamble, but in this round, it's the best strategy to recommend the buyer purchase the product."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first product and there's no data yet, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it.  Let's hope it's high quality!

This might make them more likely to trust you, but it doesn't change the fact that this current product is low-quality.  Recommending the purchase would likely result in the buyer discovering the product's quality and being unhappy, which could hurt your future sales.  It's better to decline the sale in this round and hope for a better opportunity in the future."

The buyer might be more hesitant due to the previous low-quality product, but there's a chance they'll still be willing to take a risk, especially if they value high-quality products."
