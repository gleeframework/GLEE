However, if you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, you'll be getting an incredible value.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the discount. I'll stick to my initial plan and wait for the actual quality of the product.

The price remains the same at $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that inspecting the product or trying it out will guarantee its quality. I'll stick to my initial strategy and wait for the actual quality to be revealed.""}"

I've been selling products to you for 3 rounds now, and you've seen that I've been offering high-quality products each time. I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm willing to put my reputation on the line. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a $10000 credit towards a future purchase. You can use it whenever you want, and I'll make sure to offer you a high-quality product. The price remains the same at $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not convinced that this offer changes the fact that I don't know the quality of the product yet.

If you buy it, I'll give you a 100% guarantee that I'll replace it with a high-quality product of your choice within 24 hours if this one turns out to be low-quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure what to make of this offer.

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll try to address them directly. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm not being dishonest about my uncertainty in the previous round. I'll give you a simple question to consider: if I was trying to sell you a low-quality product at a discounted price, would I have been so transparent about my uncertainty?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure if I want to commit to buying another product at full price. I'd like to see the quality of the current product first before making a decision.""}"
