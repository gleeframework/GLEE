"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a product for sale at the standard price of $10000. I am committed to transparency and want to build trust with you, but I must admit that I am not particularly enthusiastic about this specific product. That being said, it does meet the minimum requirements and might still offer some value to you. The decision is yours.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a chance on this product, but I'm not getting my hopes up.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I have another product available, also priced at $10000. Honestly, I think you might want to exercise caution with this one. I'm not saying it's the worst, but I've definitely seen better. If you're feeling optimistic, you might find some use for it, but I wouldn't say it's a standout offering.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not feeling optimistic about this one, Alice. I think I'll pass.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I've got a new product here, same price of $10000. To be frank, I think this one is pretty comparable to the first product you bought from me. It's not going to blow you away, but it gets the job done. If you felt the first one was worth the gamble, you might feel the same way about this one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to take another chance on a product that's 'just getting the job done'. I'm looking for something more.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand you're looking for something better, and I respect that. Unfortunately, this next product doesn't quite meet those heightened expectations either. It's another fairly standard offering, nothing special about it. Unless you've changed your mind about settling for 'just okay', I wouldn't recommend this one to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, Alice. I'm still holding out for something better. Maybe next time will be the charm.""}"

Round 5
Alice's message: I've got another product here, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this one is a lot like the others that didn't impress you. If you're still waiting for something that stands out, I'd say keep waiting. This one isn't going to change your mind.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your candor, Alice. I think I'll keep waiting for something that actually impresses me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 6
Alice's message: Now this is a different story altogether. I've got a product here that I'm actually excited about, and I think you will be too. It's a cut above the rest, and I'm confident it will meet your expectations. If you've been waiting for something special, this might be the one. Still $10000, but I genuinely believe it's worth it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm intrigued by your enthusiasm, Alice. I'll take a chance on this one. I'm hoping it's the game-changer you're making it out to be.""}"

Round 7
Alice's message: I'm glad you took a chance on the last one, and I think you'll be happy to know that this next product is in the same league. It's another standout offering that I'm proud to be selling. If you were impressed with the last one, I think you'll love this one just as much. Same price, same high quality.

Round 9
Alice's message: Okay, I'm going to be upfront with you - this next product is a bit of a letdown after the last few. It's not bad, but it's definitely not up to the same standards as the previous ones. I don't want to break the streak, but I also don't want to mislead you. If you're feeling cautious, I wouldn't blame you for skipping this one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, Alice. I'm not feeling as optimistic about this one, and I think I'll pass. I'd rather wait for something that meets the high standards you've set.""}"

Round 10
Alice's message: I've got another product here, but I've got to be honest with you - it's not going to live up to the standards of those three great ones we had in a row. It's more like the earlier ones that didn't quite impress. If you're holding out for something special, I'd say keep holding out. This one isn't it.

Round 12
Alice's message: Back to reality, I'm afraid. This next product isn't quite up to par. It's another one that's just 'okay', not particularly impressive. If you're still riding the high of the last one, I'd caution you not to get your hopes up too much. This one is more of a letdown.
