Alice's message: Honestly, I don't have any specific reason to think this product is low-quality. It's just a product that didn't meet my high standards, and I'm not going to waste my time trying to sell it to anyone who's looking for a high-quality item.

Alice's message: You're a tough negotiator, I like that! Alright, let's think about it this way: even if the true proportion of high-quality products is lower than 37.5%, it's still a 1 in 3 chance.
