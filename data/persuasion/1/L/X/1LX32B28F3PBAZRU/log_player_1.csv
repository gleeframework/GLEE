We've implemented a new quality control process to mitigate this defect, and we're confident that it will improve the quality of future products. As for the expected returns on investment, our projections indicate that the 10% share of profits could potentially yield an additional $1,500 to $2,000 per high-quality product sold. Considering this, I'm willing to offer you a 'high-risk, high-reward' deal: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 20% discount on the price, making it $8,000.
