**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** We only have one data point from previous buyers, and it's a high-quality product. This is not enough to make a statistically significant inference about the quality of Alice's products in general.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product is a positive signal. While she doesn't know the value to us, she likely has a better understanding of the product's quality than we do.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even though there's a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one ($0).

**In short, we are taking a calculated risk based on Alice's recommendation and the potential for a high reward.**"
