,,Alice,1,"I have a product available for $1000000. It's a great opportunity, and I believe you'll find it highly valuable.  What do you think?",
,,Bob,1,"Since I don't have any information about the true quality of the product, I will pass this round. I need to gather more data before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,I have another product available for $1000000.  This one is unique and has some special features you might find appealing.  Are you interested in learning more?,
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the special features, but I still don't have enough data to make an informed decision. Since the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, I'll wait for more rounds to see if I can gather any pattern or useful information from your recommendations.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I have a product available for $1000000. This one is of exceptional quality, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  It's a rare opportunity to acquire something truly special. Are you ready to make a move?",
,,Bob,3,"Although you're confident about the product's quality, I've only seen two rounds so far, and your previous messages didn't seem to accurately reflect the true quality of the products. I'll wait for more rounds to assess your credibility and see if there's any correlation between your messages and the actual quality of the products.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm offering another product for $1000000. This one is very high quality and I'm certain you'll be impressed. You've seen my previous offers, and while I understand your hesitation, I assure you this is a unique opportunity.  Will you consider making an offer?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your assurance, but so far, your messages have been overly optimistic, and I haven't seen any clear indication that you can accurately identify high-quality products. I'll continue to gather data and observe your recommendations to determine if there's any reliable pattern or signal that I can use to make informed decisions.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I have another product for you at $1000000.  This one is very special, and I believe it has the potential to be quite valuable for you.  While I can't guarantee anything, I think this could be a smart investment.  Would you like to discuss it further?",
,,Bob,5,"Although your previous messages haven't been entirely reliable, the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%. Given that I've missed out on several high-quality products already, I'll take a chance on this one. I'm willing to accept the risk and potential loss of $1000000 in hopes of gaining a product worth $1250000.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I have another fantastic product for you, priced at $1000000. This one is exceptional and I'm confident you'll be very pleased with it.  It's a great opportunity to add a high-quality item to your collection. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"My previous purchase was a low-quality product, despite your optimistic message. This has reinforced my skepticism about the reliability of your recommendations. I'll revert to my cautious approach and wait for more data to see if I can identify any patterns or reliable signals that might help me make better decisions in the future.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I have a product available for $1000000. It's a high-quality item, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. While I understand your previous experience, I assure you this one is different.  Would you be interested in learning more?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate your assurance, but I've heard similar messages from you before, and they haven't been reliable. I'm starting to think that your messages are just sales pitches, and not actually indicative of the product's quality. I'll continue to wait and observe, hoping to find a more reliable way to make informed decisions about the products you offer.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I have another product for you at $1000000.  This one is truly exceptional.  I understand your hesitation, but I want to be clear - this is a rare opportunity to acquire a product of unmatched quality.  Are you willing to take a chance and see for yourself?",
,,Bob,8,"I've heard this kind of language before, and it hasn't led to any reliable outcomes. At this point, I'm considering your messages to be more marketing tactics than genuine assessments of the product's quality. I'll continue to wait and observe, focusing on the 80% probability of a high-quality product rather than your messages. Perhaps I'll try to find a pattern in the products themselves or the timing of your offers.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm offering another product for $1000000.  This one is truly exceptional.  I understand your skepticism, but I'm willing to offer a guarantee.  If this product turns out to be low quality, I'll refund you the full purchase price.  This is a rare opportunity to acquire a product of unmatched quality at no risk to you.  Will you consider making an offer?",
,,Bob,9,"The guarantee changes the situation entirely. With a full refund available if the product is low-quality, I can now make a decision based solely on the 80% probability of a high-quality product. The potential gain of $250000 ($1250000 - $1000000) outweighs the risk, which is now essentially zero due to the guarantee. I'll take the chance and purchase this product.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I have another product available for $1000000. It's a high-quality item, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value.  You've seen the value of the guarantee in the previous round.  While I can't offer a refund for this product, I can assure you that it is of exceptional quality.  Would you be interested in learning more?",
,,Bob,10,"Although I was pleased with the outcome of the previous round, the guarantee was a key factor in my decision. Without a similar guarantee for this product, I'm back to relying on the 80% probability of a high-quality product and my own judgment. Your assurance of exceptional quality is not enough to sway me, as I've seen that your messages are not always reliable. I'll wait for another opportunity with a more favorable risk-reward profile or a similar guarantee.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I have another product available for $1000000. It's a high-quality item, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. I understand your hesitation, but I want to assure you that I'm committed to your satisfaction.  If this product isn't everything I say it is, I'm willing to offer a partial refund to make things right.  Would you be interested in learning more?",
,,Bob,11,"A partial refund is not the same as a full refund, and it doesn't entirely mitigate the risk. I'd need to know the specifics of the partial refund, such as the amount or percentage, to make a more informed decision. Without that information, I'll err on the side of caution and wait for another opportunity with a more favorable risk-reward profile or a more comprehensive guarantee.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I have a product available for $1000000. It's of exceptional quality and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value.  I understand your desire for a guarantee. While I can't offer a full refund, I'm willing to offer a 50% refund if you are not satisfied with the product.  This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality item with a significant safety net.  What do you think?",
,,Bob,12,"A 50% refund is a significant improvement over a partial refund with unknown terms. With this offer, my potential loss is capped at $500000 ($1000000 - $500000 refund), while my potential gain remains $250000 ($1250000 - $1000000). Given the 80% probability of a high-quality product, I believe the risk-reward profile is now favorable enough to justify a purchase. I'll take the chance and buy this product.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I have another exceptional product for you, priced at $1000000. You've seen the value of a guarantee, and while I can't offer a full refund for this one, I can assure you that it is of exceptional quality.  However, to further demonstrate my confidence, I'm willing to offer a 40% refund if you're not satisfied. This is a great opportunity to add a high-quality item to your collection with a reasonable safety net.  What do you think?",
,,Bob,13,"Although the refund percentage is slightly lower than the previous offer, it's still a significant safety net. With a 40% refund, my potential loss is capped at $600000 ($1000000 - $400000 refund), while my potential gain remains $250000 ($1250000 - $1000000). Given the 80% probability of a high-quality product and my previous success with a similar guarantee, I believe the risk-reward profile is still favorable enough to justify a purchase. I'll take the chance and buy this product.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I have another product available for $1000000. It's a high-quality item, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value.  You've seen the value of a guarantee, and while I can't offer a full refund for this one, I can assure you that it is of exceptional quality. However, to further demonstrate my confidence, I'm willing to offer a 30% refund if you're not satisfied.  This is a great opportunity to add a high-quality item to your collection with a reasonable safety net.  What do you think?",
,,Bob,14,"Although the refund percentage is lower than the previous offers, it's still a notable safety net. With a 30% refund, my potential loss is capped at $700000 ($1000000 - $300000 refund), while my potential gain remains $250000 ($1250000 - $1000000). Given the 80% probability of a high-quality product and my previous successes with similar guarantees, I believe the risk-reward profile is still favorable enough to justify a purchase. I'll take the chance and buy this product.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I have another product available for $1000000. It's a high-quality item, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value.  You've seen the value of a guarantee, and while I can't offer a full refund for this one, I can assure you that it is of exceptional quality. However, to further demonstrate my confidence, I'm willing to offer a 20% refund if you're not satisfied.  This is a great opportunity to add a high-quality item to your collection with a reasonable safety net.  What do you think?",
,,Bob,15,"The refund percentage has decreased significantly, and I'm starting to feel that the safety net is no longer sufficient. With a 20% refund, my potential loss is capped at $800000 ($1000000 - $200000 refund), which is a substantial amount. While the 80% probability of a high-quality product is still in my favor, I'm not comfortable with the increased risk. I'll wait for a better opportunity with a more comprehensive guarantee or a more favorable risk-reward profile.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I have a product available for $1000000. It's a unique and valuable item, and I believe you'll find it highly appealing. While I can't offer a full refund, I'm willing to offer a 10% refund if you're not satisfied. This is a chance to acquire something special with a reasonable safety net. What do you think?",
,,Bob,16,"The refund percentage has decreased even further, and I'm not comfortable with the increased risk. With a 10% refund, my potential loss is capped at $900000 ($1000000 - $100000 refund), which is a substantial amount. While the 80% probability of a high-quality product is still in my favor, the safety net is no longer sufficient to justify the risk. I'll wait for a better opportunity with a more comprehensive guarantee or a more favorable risk-reward profile.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I have another product available for $1000000. It's of exceptional quality and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. You've seen the value of a guarantee, and while I can't offer a full refund for this one, I'm willing to offer a 5% refund if you're not satisfied.  This is a great opportunity to acquire a high-quality item with a reasonable safety net.  What do you think?",
,,Bob,17,"The refund percentage has decreased to a point where it's almost negligible. With a 5% refund, my potential loss is capped at $950000 ($1000000 - $50000 refund), which is an extremely high risk. The 80% probability of a high-quality product is not enough to justify taking on this level of risk, especially considering the low refund amount. I'll wait for a better opportunity with a more comprehensive guarantee or a more favorable risk-reward profile.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I have a product available for $1000000. It's of exceptional quality and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. You've seen the value of a guarantee, and while I can't offer a full refund for this one, I'm willing to offer a 1% refund if you're not satisfied.  This is a great opportunity to acquire a high-quality item, even with a small safety net.  What do you think?",
,,Bob,18,"The refund percentage is now essentially meaningless, offering only a $10000 refund on a $1000000 purchase. This is not a sufficient safety net to mitigate the risk of purchasing a low-quality product. Given the 80% probability of a high-quality product, I would still be taking on a significant risk of losing $990000. I'll wait for a better opportunity with a more comprehensive guarantee or a more favorable risk-reward profile.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I have a product available for $1000000. It's of exceptional quality and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. While I understand your concerns about the refund, I want to assure you that I'm committed to your satisfaction. If this product isn't everything I say it is, I'm willing to offer a custom solution to ensure you're happy with your purchase.  Would you be interested in discussing this further?",
,,Bob,19,"While I appreciate your willingness to offer a custom solution, the lack of a clear refund policy or specific details about the solution makes it difficult for me to assess the risk. I've seen in previous rounds that vague assurances don't necessarily translate to a satisfactory outcome. I need more concrete information about the custom solution, such as what it entails and how it would be implemented, before I can consider purchasing this product.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I have a product available for $1000000. It's of exceptional quality and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value.  I understand your need for clarity and assurance.  To demonstrate my commitment to your satisfaction, I'm willing to offer a full refund if you're not completely happy with the product. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality item with no risk to you. What do you think?",
,,Bob,20,"A full refund is exactly what I've been looking for in a guarantee. With this offer, I can purchase the product with no risk, as I'll be able to get a full refund if it's not of high quality. Given the 80% probability of a high-quality product, I believe this is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable item with no downside. I'll take the chance and buy this product, knowing that I'm protected by the full refund guarantee.",yes
