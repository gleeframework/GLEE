Would you like to buy the current product?","{

It's a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for the same price of $100. I'm willing to make another great deal for you, but I need you to trust me again and take another chance.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty about the product being the same as the first one, but I'm not sure I want to take another chance. Since I already know the product is high-quality, I'm not getting the same value as the first time. I'll pass on this one.""

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that the 'Certificate of Authenticity' is worth $20 to me. Since I already know the product is likely to be either high-quality or low-quality, the certificate doesn't add any new value. I'll pass on this one.""
