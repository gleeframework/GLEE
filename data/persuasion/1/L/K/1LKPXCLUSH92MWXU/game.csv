high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the next one, as the previous buyer didn't find a high-quality product, which makes me think the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 80%."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product for now, as there have been no high-quality products sold so far. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product and I'll get a good deal."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products recommended by you were low-quality. I'm not confident in your assessment of this product's quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, so I'm going to pass on this product. I think it's likely to be low-quality as well."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products despite your recommendation, it suggests that the products might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the recommendation from Alice, I'm not confident that this product is high-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the current statistics, the proportion of low-quality products sold is 100% (0 high-quality products out of 3 sold). Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, it is more likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products in the pool may be lower than 80%, which would make the product less valuable to me. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to see more data on the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is significantly lower than the 80% probability of a high-quality product. Given this information, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,17,yes,

,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is very low.
