,,Alice,1,"This is a one-of-a-kind, extremely rare opportunity to purchase a product from me. I'm offering it to you for a mere $100, a steal considering the value it could bring to your life. I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say? Will you take it home today?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take it, but I'm doing it with a grain of salt. I know there's a 50% chance it's high-quality, and if it's not, I'll be out $100. But I'm willing to take that risk for the potential reward.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're a savvy buyer, I like that! I've sold 1 product so far, and it was a low-quality one. That means I have 19 more products to go, and I'm guessing the next one has a 50% chance of being high-quality. But let me tell you, this one feels different. I've got a good feeling about it. Would you like to take a chance on it for $100?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Ah, my intuition is a keen sense, honed from years of selling products. Let's just say I've developed a bit of a sixth sense for spotting the good ones. But I'll let you in on a secret: I've sold 2 products now, and only 1 of them was high-quality. That means the odds are still in your favor. I'm offering this one to you for $100, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Trust me, it's worth a shot!",

With 17 products left, I'm feeling confident that I've got a good streak going. This one feels like it's going to be a winner, and I'm willing to bet on it. Will you join me on this winning streak for $100?",

I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this one might not be a winner. But I'm still offering it to you for $100, and I'll let you in on a secret: I'm not as confident as I was earlier. Will you take a chance on me and this product?",

,,Alice,7,"I've got to be honest with you, I'm on a bit of a slump. I've sold 6 products, and only 3 of them were high-quality. That's a 50% success rate, which is right back to the average. I'm not trying to be negative, but I think it's only fair to let you know the odds. That being said, I'm still offering this product to you for $100. It's not going to change the odds, but it might just surprise you. What do you say?",
