high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on the fact that none of the previous products were high-quality. I'm not convinced that this product is worth the $1000000 price tag, especially given the low success rate so far."
