If it turns out to be high-quality, I'll be happy to pay the full price of $300. If it's low-quality, I'll take a loss of $200. I'm hoping it's high-quality, of course!"

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous buyer was lucky and the product was low quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high quality.
