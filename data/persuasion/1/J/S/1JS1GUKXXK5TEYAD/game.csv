,,the buyer,11,"I'd like to take a chance on this product, but I'm going to make an educated guess based on the statistics. Since 60% of your previous sales have been high-quality, I'm going to assume that the product has a 60% chance of being high-quality. Given the value of a high-quality product to me ($30000), I'll calculate the expected value of buying the product: 0.6 * $30000 = $18000. Since the price is $10000, I'll take the chance and buy the product.",yes

,,the buyer,12,"I appreciate your kind words, Alice. Based on the statistics, I see that 63.64% of your sales have been high-quality products. This suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is around 63.64%. Since I value a high-quality product at $30000 and a low-quality product at $0, the expected value of buying the product is 0.6364 * 30000 + 0.3636 * 0 = $19152.
