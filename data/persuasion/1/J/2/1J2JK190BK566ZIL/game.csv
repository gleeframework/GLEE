,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I would like to pass on this product and not give Alice the opportunity to sell another potentially low-quality product to someone else."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the current product being high quality is 80.00%. However, since all previous buyers were recommended to buy and they all passed, I'm concerned that Alice might be biased towards recommending low-quality products.
