If you're consistently unwilling to take the risk, I might need to reconsider our business together.

The decision remains yours.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your attempt to frame the opportunity cost, but it's not enough to change my decision. I still don't have enough information to justify paying $1,000,000 for a product of unknown quality.""}"
