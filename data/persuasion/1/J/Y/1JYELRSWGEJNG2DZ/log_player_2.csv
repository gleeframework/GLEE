**Explanation:**

Based on the information provided, here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's Track Record:** Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products. This is a strong indicator that her recommendations are reliable.
* **Value Proposition:** The potential gain from a high-quality product ($2,000,000) significantly outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0).
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there is a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the 80% chance of getting a high-quality product makes the risk worth taking. 

Therefore, it's logical to accept Alice's recommendation and purchase the product."
