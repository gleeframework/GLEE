high-quality,300.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the fact that I'm the first buyer and I don't have any information to go on. I'm essentially taking a wild guess."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the low probability of a high-quality product might be skewed by the fact that you've already sold one high-quality product, and I'd like to take advantage of the potential upside."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but I've seen that 1 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the product, and only 1 of them was high quality. Given the low probability of getting a high-quality product, I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, considering the low recommendation rate from Alice and the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 3. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

,,Alice,9,no,

high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I want to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is lower than the expected 33.33%?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your recommendation and the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 4, it seems the odds are against me. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. I'm basing my decision on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, which might mean it's low-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk. If it's high-quality, I'll be happy to purchase it at $100, which is a great deal compared to its value of $300."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product. Is it because of the low sales record or the product's quality?
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far (1/5), I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product."

,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but based on the statistics, there's a 66.67% chance it's low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is more promising."
