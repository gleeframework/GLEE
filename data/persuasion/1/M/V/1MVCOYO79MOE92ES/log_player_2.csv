**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We don't have enough information to make a strong statistical judgment.  Only one previous buyer has purchased, and it was a high-quality product. This is a small sample size, and it's possible Alice is simply recommending products she knows are high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of buying a high-quality product ($2,000 profit) is significant compared to the risk of buying a low-quality product ($10,000 loss). 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice's recommendation suggests she has an incentive to sell the product. It's in her best interest to sell high-quality products to maintain a good reputation. 

**Overall, while there's no guarantee, the risk of purchasing a low-quality product is worth taking given the potential reward.**"

**Reasoning:**

The information provided is very compelling:

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, and she knows the true quality of the product. This is a strong signal.
* **High Success Rate:**  9 out of 9 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation got a high-quality product.  This suggests Alice is very accurate in her recommendations.

**Risk:**

The risk is that Alice is intentionally steering buyers towards low-quality products to maximize her profits. However, the high success rate makes this scenario less likely. 

**Overall:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk, especially given Alice's strong track record."
