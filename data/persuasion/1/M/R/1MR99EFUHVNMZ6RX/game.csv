,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not going to buy the product yet. I'd like to see the statistics after you've sold one product to another buyer, so I can get a better idea of the product quality distribution."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see the statistics of the product after I pass, and then I'll decide whether to buy the next one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I know it's a 80% chance of being high quality, and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm not confident in buying this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that you recommended it might be a red flag, and I'd rather not take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, there's only one high-quality product sold out of one, which means the probability of the product being high-quality is 100%. However, since you know the probability of the product being high-quality is 80%, I'll take a cautious approach and pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is reliable given the low sample size of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get more information about the previous buyer's experience before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendation. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can get a good deal, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, the probability of the product being low-quality seems higher than the probability of it being high-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered based on the previous sales record. I'd like to make an informed decision based on the statistics.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice is trying to manipulate me based on the previous buyers' data. I'll wait for more information before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products is 50%, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low success rate so far. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, and considering the 80.00% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm not confident enough to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100, especially since I know Alice has access to my valuation of the product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one high-quality product sold out of two, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the 80% stated. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
