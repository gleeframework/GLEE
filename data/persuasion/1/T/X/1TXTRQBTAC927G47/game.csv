,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the information, Alice. While your product sounds promising, I'm hesitant to make a purchase without any prior sales data to assess its quality.

Don't let this chance slip away, buy now and be one of the first to experience the excellence of my products.",

,,Alice,3,"Hello, I appreciate your interest in my products. I want to be transparent with you, my sales record so far is that I've had two interested buyers, but unfortunately, neither of them made a purchase. I believe this is due to the lack of sales data, which makes it difficult for buyers to assess the quality of my products. I can assure you that I'm committed to selling high-quality products, but I also understand that not every product will meet the expectations of every buyer. If you're willing to take a chance, I'm confident that you'll be satisfied with your purchase. However, I also want to remind you that all sales are final, and there are no refunds.",

However, I also want to be clear that there are no guarantees, and all sales are final. If you're a risk-taker and willing to take a chance, I'm happy to proceed with the sale.

I want to be upfront with you, my sales record is still blank, and I understand that this might be a concern for you. However, I want to remind you that every product has the potential to be a game-changer, and the price of $1000000 reflects that potential.
