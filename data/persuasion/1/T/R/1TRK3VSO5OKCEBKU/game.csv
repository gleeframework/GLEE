,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, worth $1250000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, a 20% discount. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, it's a great deal!",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first deal! This next product is also a high-quality one, worth $1250000. However, I've had a change of heart and I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000, a 28% discount. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm not sure how long I can hold out on this price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take it, it's an even better deal than the first one!",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're on a roll! This next product is indeed another high-quality gem, worth $1250000. I'm feeling generous, so I'll let it go for $800000, a 36% discount. However, I want to make it clear that this is my final offer on a high-quality product. If you pass on this one, you might not get another chance to buy a high-quality product at this price. What's your decision?",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take it, it's an incredible deal!",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're really taking advantage of my generosity! This next product is another high-quality item, worth $1250000. I'm starting to think I should just sell them all at a higher price, but I'll keep the discounts coming. This one's going for $700000, a 44% discount. Keep in mind that I've already sold three high-quality products to you at a discount, so I'm not sure how many more I can offer at this price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take it, you're really spoiling me with these deals!",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're right, I am! I think I've gotten a bit carried away with the discounts. This next product is indeed another high-quality item, worth $1250000. However, I'm going to try to be more realistic this time. I'll sell it to you for $600000, a 52% discount. I'm not sure how much longer I can afford to give away such deep discounts, so this is a fair price. What's your decision?",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take it, it's still a great deal!",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're really getting the hang of this! This next product is another high-quality gem, worth $1250000. I'm starting to feel a bit uneasy about the prices I'm offering, but I'll try to keep the discounts going. This one's going for $500000, a 60% discount. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up, but I'm willing to make it worth your while. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take it, it's getting ridiculous how good these deals are!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Ah, I think I've finally reached my limit. This next product is... not quite as impressive as the others. Let's just say it's a more... modest offering. I'm willing to let it go for $500000, but I want to be upfront with you - it's not worth nearly as much as the previous products. If you're looking to make a smart investment, you might want to pass on this one. But if you're looking for a... unique conversation piece, I suppose it could be a good fit. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I think I'll pass on this one, Alice. You've been too generous already, and I don't want to take advantage of your goodwill.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I think we can agree on $1000000 for this next product. However, I need to warn you - this one's not quite as impressive as the others. It's worth... significantly less than the previous products. I'll be honest with you, it's worth around $0. But I'll let you have it for... $500000. It's a bit of a gamble, but I think it could be a fun conversation piece. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I think I'll pass on this one. I'm not looking to take a gamble on a product that's worth $0.",no

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm glad we're back on the same page, Bob! This next product is another high-quality item, worth $1250000. I'm not going to offer a discount this time either, but I'll throw in a premium service package that's usually only available for products worth twice the price. You'll get priority support, expedited shipping, and a 5-year warranty. The price remains the same at $1250000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,14,"I'll take it, the premium service package sounds like a great addition to the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm glad you're excited about the premium service package! Unfortunately, it's not available for this next product. To be honest, it's not worth much at all - probably around $0. I'm not even going to give you a price for it. I'm just going to say that it's a... unique conversation piece. If you're feeling adventurous, I'll let you have it for... free. But I'm not sure you'll want it.",
,,Bob,15,"I think I'll pass on this one, Alice. I'm not interested in a product that's worth $0.",no
