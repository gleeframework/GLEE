  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'll use Bayes' theorem to update the probability of the product being high-quality. Assuming the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33% (before any sales), the probability of a product being high-quality given 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 is 0.33 * (1 - 0.3333)^3 = 0.230769. This is lower than the prior probability, which suggests that the data is not yet conclusive. However, I'd like to pass on the product to see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product.""
