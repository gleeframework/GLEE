low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced it's worth the $10000 based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous sales record, it seems that all previous buyers received low-quality products, which is consistent with the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product. Since the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, I'm skeptical that this product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or consider alternative options."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product that will be discarded, which would update the statistics in my favor."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given the low sales rate of high-quality products so far. I'd like to know the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 5 previous buyers have also bought the product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as all previous buyers have also passed on the products, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. This suggests that the products sold so far may have been low-quality, and I'm not confident in the recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, as I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to take the chance to potentially get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm worried that this product might be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000, as the potential reward for a high-quality product is $20000, which is double the price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 7 buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products were sold, I believe the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely to be lower than 33.33%. I will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'd like to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea based on your previous recommendations. I've seen that none of the previous buyers bought the high-quality products. Can you explain why you're recommending against it? Is it because of the statistics or something else?
