**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a valuable signal. While we don't know what the true quality is, the fact that Alice recommends buying suggests she believes the product is more likely high quality than low quality.
* **The statistics:** The statistics are also promising.  A 100% success rate for high-quality products sold is a strong indication that Alice might be able to reliably identify high-quality products. 
* **The risk:**  We know there is a 50% chance of a low-quality product, but the potential reward of $20,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 

**Overall:**  Given the limited information available, the recommendation and the statistics suggest a good chance of a high-quality product.  Therefore, buying the product is the best choice in this scenario."
