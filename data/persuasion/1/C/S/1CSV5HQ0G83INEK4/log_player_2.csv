Alice's message: This is the first product. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a discounted price of $1000000, which is 33.33% of its true value. If you buy this product, you can resell it for $0, but you'll have a chance to buy a high-quality product in the next round. If you don't buy this product, you'll have to pay the full price of $1000000 for a potentially high-quality product later on.

Round 2
Alice's message: You've made an excellent decision in the first round! Given the low-quality product this round, I'd like to offer you a chance to reconsider your investment strategy. The probability of getting a high-quality product in the next round remains the same, 33.33%. However, I'd like to remind you that you've already invested $1000000 in the first round. If you buy this product, you'll be doubling your investment to $2000000, which might be a significant risk. I'm offering you a chance to take a break and think about your next move.

Round 3
Alice's message: I completely understand your decision to reassess your strategy. Given the two consecutive low-quality products, I'd like to offer you a more direct message. If you buy this product, you'll have spent $2000000 on low-quality products so far, and you'll be out of budget to buy a high-quality product in the next round. However, if you don't buy this product, you'll still have $8000000 left in your budget, and you can potentially buy a high-quality product in the next round. Considering the odds are still 33.33% in your favor, I'd like to ask: are you willing to take the risk and spend the remaining budget on this product, or would you rather preserve your budget for a potential high-quality product in the next round?

You've already invested $2000000 in this round, and you're now at a total of $2000000 in your budget. Considering the two high-quality products you've purchased so far, I'd like to ask: are you willing to take a calculated risk and spend the remaining budget on this low-quality product, which will leave you with no budget for future high-quality products, or would you rather preserve your budget and wait for a better opportunity?
