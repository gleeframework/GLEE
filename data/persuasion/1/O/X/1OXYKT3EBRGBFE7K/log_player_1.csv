Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""I'm glad you're interested in the safety net offer. Let me calculate the updated probability for you. Since you're getting a refund if the product is low-quality, you'll only be charged if the product is high-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, but since you'll only be charged if it's high-quality, the effective probability of getting a high-quality product with the safety net is 100% * (80% / (80% + 20%)) = 80% * (4/5) = 64%. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4, and I'm offering you a 64% chance of getting a high-quality product with the safety net. This is a unique opportunity to take a calculated risk and potentially get a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you think?""}"

I'd like to remind you that you have the option to buy this product without the safety net, and the price remains the same at $1,000,000. However, I'd like to offer you a new option - I'll give you a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product at the same price.
