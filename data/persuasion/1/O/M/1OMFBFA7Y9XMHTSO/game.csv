low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,no,,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you don't recommend it, and no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product and hope for a better chance of getting a high-quality one.",

,,Alice,4,yes,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,no,,

,,Alice,8,yes,,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,

,,Alice,13,yes,,"I know my previous recommendations haven't been well-received, but I assure you that this product is genuinely high-quality. Out of 12 products offered so far, none of the high-quality products have been sold. I'm hoping to break this streak with you. Please consider buying this product."
