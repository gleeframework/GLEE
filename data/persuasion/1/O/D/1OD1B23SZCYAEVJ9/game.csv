high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $500000. I'm offering it at a significant discount from its true value, which I believe is higher than $1000000.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying at that price. I think you're trying to sell me a high-quality product, but I'm not willing to pay more than $1000000 for it.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your position, but I'd like to clarify that this is indeed a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm not looking to make a huge profit on this one, and I think it's a fair price considering its value. If you're still not interested, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to buy a bundle of two high-quality products for $1800000, which is a better deal than buying two separate products at $1000000 each.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm still not interested in buying the single high-quality product at $1000000. However, I'm intrigued by the offer of a bundle of two high-quality products for $1800000. I'd like to consider that option, but I need to think about it. Can I have a moment to deliberate?",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand that you need time to think about the bundle offer. In the meantime, I'd like to provide you with some additional information to help you make a decision. I've had previous customers who were willing to pay up to $1200000 for a single high-quality product. However, I'm willing to hold the bundle offer open for you, and if you're interested, we can discuss the details further. If you're still unsure, I'd be happy to offer you a chance to buy this high-quality product at the same price of $1000000 as before.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the additional information, but I'm still not convinced that buying a single high-quality product at $1000000 is a good deal for me. I'm more interested in the bundle offer, but I'd like to know more about the details before making a decision. Can you tell me more about the bundle, such as how long I'll have to buy the second product, and what happens if I don't end up buying the second product?",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're interested in the bundle offer. If you decide to buy the first high-quality product for $1000000, you'll have 3 rounds to purchase the second high-quality product at the same price of $1000000. If you don't buy the second product within those 3 rounds, the offer will expire, and the first product will be removed from the bundle. However, if you do buy the second product within the 3-round window, you'll get a 5% discount on the total price of the bundle, making it $1710000. This way, you'll have a chance to take advantage of the bundle deal, but also have some flexibility in case you need more time to decide.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the current high-quality product for $1000000. I'll have 3 rounds to decide on the second product, and I'll have the option to get a 5% discount on the bundle if I decide to buy it. I'm hoping to get lucky and get the second product as well.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on your purchase! I'm glad you're taking advantage of the bundle offer. Now, let's talk about the second product. I'll give you a special deal: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll not only give you the 5% discount on the bundle price, but I'll also throw in an exclusive service package worth $200000. This package includes priority support, expedited delivery, and a personalized consultation to ensure you get the most out of your high-quality products. The total price for this high-quality product, including the service package, would be $1000000. If you buy this product, you'll be just one step away from getting the 5% discount on the bundle price.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that the exclusive service package is worth an additional $200000. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the second product at the regular price of $1000000, and then get the 5% discount on the bundle price. I'd rather save the $200000 and hope that the second product is high-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your decision. Now, let's talk about the current product. I want to be transparent with you - this product is actually a low-quality one. I know you're not getting the best value for your money, but I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price of $1000000. I'm doing this because I want to demonstrate my commitment to our business relationship and show that I'm willing to work with you even when the odds are against me. I'm hoping that you'll appreciate this gesture and consider it a one-time courtesy.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $1000000. I'd rather pass on this opportunity and wait for the next round, hoping to get a high-quality product.",no

,,Alice,7,"I completely understand your decision. Now, let's move on to the current high-quality product. I want to remind you that you have 2 remaining rounds to buy the second product and complete the bundle deal. I'll give you a new offer: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll throw in an additional 2% discount on the bundle price, making it a total of 7% off the original price. This would bring the total price down to $1673000. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get an excellent deal on a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm interested in the new offer, and I think the additional 2% discount is a good incentive. I'll buy the current high-quality product for $1000000.",yes

This would bring the total price down to $1540000. Additionally, I'll include a personalized thank-you gift worth $50000, which I think you'll really appreciate. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal on a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm tempted by the offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best decision. I've already spent $2000000 on two high-quality products, and I'm not sure if I want to spend another $1000000 on the third product. I'm going to take a chance and pass on this offer, hoping to get a low-quality product and avoid wasting another $1000000.",yes

,,Alice,11,"I understand your decision, Bob. As promised, I'll reveal the quality of the next product. Unfortunately, this product is also a low-quality one. I want to remind you that you've already invested in two high-quality products, and this third one is not worth the full price of $1000000.
