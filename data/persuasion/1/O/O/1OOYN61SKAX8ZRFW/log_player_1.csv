With this new information, I'd like to offer you this next product for the same price of $1,000,000.

Let me provide you with a more detailed breakdown of our statistics. Out of the 2 products sold, 1 was high-quality, and 1 was low-quality. This means that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, but we can also calculate the conditional probability of a high-quality product given that the first product was high-quality. This conditional probability is 100%, as the second product was also high-quality. However, this is a biased sample, and we need to consider the overall probability of a high-quality product, which remains 50%. I'd like to offer you this next product for the same price of $1,000,000. While the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, I believe our track record and experience make this product an attractive investment. What do you think?

Given our current success rate of 2 out of 3, we can calculate the probability of a high-quality product.

Our success rate is simply a reflection of the number of products sold, not the underlying probability of a high-quality product.

This means that our initial probability was overly optimistic. However, I'd like to highlight that our products are still worth $3,000,000 to buyers who get a high-quality product, and our prices are adjusted accordingly.
