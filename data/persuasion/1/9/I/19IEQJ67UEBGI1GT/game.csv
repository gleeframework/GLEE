low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm a risk-taker and I think the odds are still in my favor. I'm hoping that the product is high-quality and I'll get the $400 value. I'm aware that the previous buyer passed on the product, but I'm not drawing any conclusions from that yet. I'd like to see the product's quality after my purchase."

,,Alice,3,yes,

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one. Can you tell me more about the previous sales records? How many high-quality products have been sold in total so far? And what's the probability that the product I'm looking at is high-quality? I'd like to make an informed decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers have passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, it seems likely that the products being offered are low-quality. I'd like to wait for a more favorable signal before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the statistics. How many products have been sold in total, and what's the proportion of high-quality products in the sold products?"

,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product. Is it because the previous buyers didn't buy the high-quality products or because of some other reason?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the previous 2 buyers thought it was, since they didn't buy it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the product I'll be offered might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have gotten a high-quality product.
