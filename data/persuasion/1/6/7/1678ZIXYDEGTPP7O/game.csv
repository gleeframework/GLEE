What do you say?",

Let me make it clear: I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $100, and I'll also give you a third product of your choice (also at $100) if you buy this one.

If you don't believe me, you can take a chance and buy it. If it's low-quality, you'll get a refund, and I'll have lost money. If it's high-quality, you'll get a great deal. It's a 20% discount, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",

I'm willing to take the loss to get rid of it, and I'm offering it to you at this price because I think you'll eventually buy a high-quality product from me.
