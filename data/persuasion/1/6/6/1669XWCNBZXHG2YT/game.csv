high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing this because I'm the third buyer and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'm relying on Alice's recommendation and the fact that 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm a bit skeptical about Alice's recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the products? What was the quality of the products they bought?"

,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products sold is slightly lower than expected (5/6 = 83.33% vs 80.00%). I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
