,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take the chance to be the first one to buy, and I'll learn from the outcome."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Based on the fact that the first buyer didn't buy the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more information about the previous buyer who purchased the product and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the quality of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the previous two buyers were just unlucky and the probability of the product being high quality is still 50%."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases so far. This suggests that the products sold were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that you don't know the value to me, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure if I should buy this product based on your previous recommendations. If all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests that it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a $0 product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the products being offered are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality, and I'd like to take a chance on the remaining product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. And, I'd like to know your recommendation to be based on a probability calculation, not just your intuition."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 buyers have passed on the product before me, and none of them were high-quality, it seems likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next one to come along."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
