,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so only because I'm the first buyer and there's no data to go off of. I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal or not."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer didn't buy and the product was recommended to buy, it seems likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you didn't recommend it. This suggests that the product might be low-quality, which would be a good deal for me. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations, I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%, making it a riskier purchase. I'd rather wait and see if the next product has a higher chance of being high-quality based on Alice's recommendations."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100, which would be a loss of $75."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability?

high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 buyers have purchased the products, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the trend continues."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 3 products, and Alice is recommending the product, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
