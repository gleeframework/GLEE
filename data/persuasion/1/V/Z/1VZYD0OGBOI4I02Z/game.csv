high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Considering the low-quality product from the previous round was sold for $5000, and given the high-quality nature of this product, I'm willing to offer a discount of $3000 off the original price of $10000. This brings the price down to $7000. Is this a price you're willing to pay for a high-quality product?",

It's a significant discount from the original price of $10000, and I'm willing to absorb the loss on this one to demonstrate my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial deal. Will you consider this offer?",

I'd like to remind you that you've already passed on a high-quality product for $7000, and I'm now offering this one at a price that's less than half of that. I'm trying to find a deal that works for both of us.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to pay more than $0 for a product worth $0 to me. I'll wait for a high-quality product at a good price.",no

Yes, you read that right. I'll give this product to you for free. I'm essentially absorbing the entire cost of the product, just to try and make a sale.

I'm confident that this is a fair price, considering the previous low-quality products I've offered. Will you consider purchasing this high-quality product?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not sure why you're offering a high-quality product now, after consistently offering low-quality products at various prices.
