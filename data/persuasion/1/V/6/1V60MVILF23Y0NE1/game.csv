,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, I don't have any information to go on yet."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product before making a decision. Was the product they purchased high-quality or low-quality?
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation based on the fact that the first buyer didn't buy the product, and you're recommending it to me. Can you provide more information about the product or the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not sure if I should buy this product given the lack of sales and the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 1 out of 1 buyer purchased the product, and that product was low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products Alice is offering. I'd like to wait and see if more data becomes available before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice is willing to sell it to me at the original price of $100. I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy, and I'm considering the probability of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were low quality, I'm inclined to believe that the products are more likely to be low quality than high quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that you have recommended two other buyers to buy and neither of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount or some other incentive, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being sold has decreased. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product at $100."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, since there have been no high-quality products sold so far. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I might be able to get it at a good price."
