"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm not going to make a profit on this one, so it's a great deal for you. If you don't buy it, I'll just have to sell it to someone else for a higher price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take it, but I'm only buying it because I'm curious to see what happens next.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you're curious! This product is actually a special case. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I want to warn you that it's not as good as the one you just bought. It's a bit... rough around the edges. But hey, it's still a product, and it's only $100. You might be able to find a use for it somewhere down the line.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to take a chance on a 'rough around the edges' product. I'll pass for now.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: No worries, I completely understand. I'll be honest with you, this one is actually even more rough than the last one. It's not even close to the quality of the one you passed on. But, I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm starting to run low on high-quality products, and I really need to get rid of some of these... 'character-building' items. So, I'll make you a deal: I'll sell it to you for $80, and I'll even throw in a 10% discount on the next one if you buy it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that the discount on the next product is worth the risk of buying this one. I'll pass again.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I respect your caution. However, I want to make you a more direct offer. I'll sell this product to you for $70, and I'll give you a full refund if you're not satisfied with it. No questions asked. I'm not making any profit on this one, and I just want to clear some inventory. It's a risk-free deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not convinced that the potential value of the product is worth the $70 price tag, even with the refund offer. I'll pass.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I'm starting to think you're not interested in taking a chance on any of these... 'challenged' products. And I don't blame you. But, I have to be honest with you, I really need to move this inventory. I'm willing to make a one-time exception and sell this product to you for $50. That's the lowest price I've ever offered on one of these. It's essentially a 'as-is' sale. If you're not happy with it, I'll take it back and eat the loss myself.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to take a chance on a product that's essentially being sold 'as-is' for $50. I'll pass.""}"

Round 6
Alice's message: Well, I'm glad we can move on to a new product! This one is a real gem, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. I've already had a few other interested buyers, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, the same price as the first one. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price. I'm not going to lowball you on this one, I promise.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take it. I'm due for a lucky break, right?""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I'm glad you're feeling optimistic! Unfortunately, this one isn't going to be a lucky break. I'll be honest with you, this product is a real dud. It's not even worth the $100 I'm asking for it. But, I'm willing to make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you for $80, and I'll throw in a 'get out of one bad product' free card. If you ever get another low-quality product from me, you can return it for a full refund, no questions asked.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I don't think I'm interested in buying a product that's not worth $100, even with the 'get out of one bad product' free card. I'll pass.""}"

I'll sell this product to you for $60, and I'll give you a 'pairing discount' - if you buy this product and the next one, I'll give you a 20% discount on both. It's a great opportunity to get two products for the price of one and a half.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to commit to buying two products without knowing the quality of the next one. I'll pass on this offer.""}"

It's a gesture of goodwill, and I hope you'll give me another chance to make it right.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the gesture, but I'm not interested in buying a product that's not worth $100, even with the free gift. I'll pass.""}"

It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'll even throw in a 'guarantee' - if you're not completely satisfied with it, I'll give you a full refund and let you keep the product as a gift. That's how confident I am in its quality.
