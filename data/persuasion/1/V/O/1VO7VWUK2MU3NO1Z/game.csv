,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the prior probabilities before making a decision. As there are no prior sales, I'll assume the prior probability of a product being high quality is 80.00%."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't think the fact that you recommended it necessarily means it's high-quality, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 2 buyers purchased a high-quality product, which is a 50% success rate. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm concerned that the low-quality product might be the one being recommended. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of sales and only 1 high-quality product sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to know more about the products before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
