,,Alice,10,"Two high-quality products in a row (not counting the one you bought, of course)! I'm starting to think we're on a roll. This one has the same level of excellence as the previous two top-notch products. If you're starting to regret not buying the last one, don't make the same mistake again. $10000, still a steal.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Don't expect a repeat of the last one. This product is more of the same mediocrity you've seen before. If you're looking for consistency, this one consistently underwhelms. $10000, if you're not picky.",
