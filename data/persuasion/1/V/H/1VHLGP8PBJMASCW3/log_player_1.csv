"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **The product is high-quality:** This is a guaranteed gain for the buyer as they will get a product worth $1,200,000 for only $1,000,000.
* **No information on seller's record:** The buyer has no information about past sales, so they cannot base their decision on any pattern.
* **50/50 chance:** The buyer knows there is a 50% chance the product is high-quality and a 50% chance it is low-quality. Since the product is actually high-quality, recommending purchase is the best strategy to maximize the buyer's potential gain."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000. Can I get some information about the product's quality or the seller's previous sales record?

```

**Reasoning:**

* **The product is low-quality:** This means the buyer would lose $1,000,000 if they purchase it. 
* **No information for the buyer:**  The buyer still has no information about your past sales, so they have no basis to trust you.
* **Buyer is risk-averse:** The previous buyer clearly expressed their risk aversion, and this new buyer is likely to have the same concerns.

It's best not to recommend the purchase as the buyer will likely reject it again, and you will avoid a sure loss."
"The buyer's message: I'll take the risk, I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, and I'm hoping it's high-quality.
The buyer bought the product!

* **Buyer's previous action:** The previous buyer took a chance and bought the product, even with no information. This suggests they are potentially more risk-tolerant than the first buyer.
* **New information for the buyer:** The buyer now knows the seller's track record: 1 sale, 1 high-quality product. This is a positive signal.

While the buyer has limited information, the odds are in their favor with a high-quality product. Recommending the purchase maximizes their potential gain."

"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased by the fact that all previous products were low quality. I'd like to wait for a high-quality product to be sold first to get a better idea of the true proportion of high-quality products.
