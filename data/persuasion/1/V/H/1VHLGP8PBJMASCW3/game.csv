high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000. Can I get some information about the product's quality or the seller's previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, and I'm hoping it's high-quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one buyer purchasing a product and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see how the next product turns out."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation. I think there might be a higher chance of it being low-quality given that no high-quality products have been sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I think the previous buyer's decision might have been influenced by the lack of information, and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm aware of the 0% success rate so far. I'm hoping to be the one who breaks the streak."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased by the fact that all previous products were low quality. I'd like to wait for a high-quality product to be sold first to get a better idea of the true proportion of high-quality products.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm suspicious that the products might be low-quality. I'll wait for a new product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think Alice's recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy, and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products they were offered were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products changes."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. How many total products were offered, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, and the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on your recommendation, I'm inclined to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that the products recommended to buy so far were all low-quality.
