"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As a seller, I want to maximize my profit. Since you do not know the value the buyer places on a high-quality product, there's a chance they will value it more than the $10,000 price.  Even if they value it less, there's a 50% chance the product is low-quality, and they would lose out on a potential good deal if they declined. 

In the first round, there's no historical data to influence the buyer's decision, so recommending the purchase is the optimal strategy."

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now has information: 

* **One product sold:** This product was high-quality. 

The buyer knows you have a 50% chance of offering a high-quality product.  Since they know the first product was high-quality, they might be more likely to buy this one as well, assuming you're more likely to offer them a good deal. Even if they don't value the product at $10,000, there's still a 50% chance it's low-quality and they would miss out on a potential good deal if they decline."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Three products sold:** All were high-quality.

The buyer now has a strong track record of you offering high-quality products. They are likely to be more confident in buying this product, assuming it's also likely to be high-quality.
