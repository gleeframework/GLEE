high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if I buy it and it's low quality, I'll be out $10000. With no high-quality products sold so far, it seems unlikely that the product I'm offered is high quality."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product.
