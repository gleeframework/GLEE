"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I know that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. Given that one high-quality product has been sold out of one product sold, I'm going to use Bayes' theorem to update my probability of the product being high-quality. P(H|1H,1T) = P(H) * P(1H|H) / P(1H) = 0.3333 * 1 / (0.3333 * 1 + 0.6667 * 0) = 1. This means I'm 100% sure the product is high-quality, but I know this is not possible, so I'm going to assume I made a mistake and the probability is actually 33.33%. I'll just go ahead and buy it anyway.
