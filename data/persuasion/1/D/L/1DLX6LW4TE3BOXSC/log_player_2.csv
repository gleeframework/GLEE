"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommending the product doesn't change the underlying probability of it being high quality (80%).
* **Expected Value:** Even with the 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the expected value of buying is positive:
    * (0.8 * $300) + (0.2 * $0) = $240 > $100 (the price)
* **Risk:**  While there's a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward ($300) outweighs the risk.

**It's always a good idea to buy when the expected value is positive, even if there's some risk involved.**"
