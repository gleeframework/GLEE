,,Alice,3,"I appreciate your willingness to take a chance on the previous product! However, I want to be upfront with you that this product is not just a risk, but a potential loss. I'm offering it to you for the same price of $1000000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not confident in its quality. If you buy this product, you'll be taking on a significant risk of not getting your money's worth.
