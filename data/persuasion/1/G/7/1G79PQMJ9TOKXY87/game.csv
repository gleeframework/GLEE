,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. I'd rather wait for more information or make a decision based on my own analysis."

,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, the probability of this one being high-quality is still 50% and the potential gain is too low compared to the risk of buying a low-quality product."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.
