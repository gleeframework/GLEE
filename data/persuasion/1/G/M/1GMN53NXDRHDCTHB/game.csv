low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I've been consistently getting high-quality products when you recommend them, but when you don't recommend, it's been low quality.

,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I've been burned again when Alice didn't recommend a product, but I've also been burned when I bought a product that she didn't recommend.
