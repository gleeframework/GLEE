"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice knows the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.  Since the product is worth $40,000 to Bob if it's high-quality and only costs $10,000, it's a good deal for him.  Even though there's a chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain significantly outweighs the potential loss in this case."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob knows the product is low-quality in the previous round, this doesn't change the fact that the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%.  Each round is independent, and the potential gain from a high-quality product ($40,000 - $10,000 = $30,000)  still outweighs the potential loss ($0 - $10,000 = -$10,000)."

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'm feeling confident about this one.
Bob bought the product!

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
