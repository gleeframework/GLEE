high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the product is likely to be low-quality, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. If it were high-quality, it's likely that at least one of the previous buyers would have bought it, given the recommendation. Therefore, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I'd rather pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/2 = 0, which is lower than the expected 33.33%. This suggests that the current product might be of low quality. I will pass on it."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality based on the previous sales record.
