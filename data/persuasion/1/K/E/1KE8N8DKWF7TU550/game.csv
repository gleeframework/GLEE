,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and the potential reward is significant."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of the products sold were high-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm skeptical of the recommendation and would like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I think the low quality product rate is high, so I'm hoping it's high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, I'll pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't find the product worth buying, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll take a chance and pass."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're recommending it suggests it might be a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $1000000 on a worthless product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous 5 buyers have also bought and no high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is likely lower than 33.33%."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, it suggests that the products Alice recommends are likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially worthless product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, it's likely that the remaining products are of low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $1000000. If it turns out to be low quality, I'll be losing $1000000, but I'm willing to take that risk given the potential reward of a high-quality product."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the sales record. How many products have been sold so far, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
