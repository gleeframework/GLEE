low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'll use the prior probability of 33.33% that the product is high quality to make my decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation doesn't carry much weight given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that she knows how much I value high-quality products. If I were to pass, she might just be trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, but I'm hoping it's a high-quality product!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm skeptical about the product based on your previous recommendations. Can you tell me more about why you're not recommending this one?
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the low sales rate of high-quality products and your own assessment of the product's value, I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know if you've noticed any patterns in the sales data that could indicate a higher likelihood of a high-quality product being sold in the future."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate that the current product is also low quality.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 33.33%. Given the 2/3 chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products, or is there another reason?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?

,,Alice,12,yes,

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain why you're advising me to pass on this product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers bought a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than the 33.33% stated, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,16,no,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products.

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless to me, and I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low success rate of high-quality products in the past."
