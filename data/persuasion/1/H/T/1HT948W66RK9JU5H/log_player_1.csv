"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Expected Value:**  Even though Bob doesn't know the quality, there's an 80% chance the product is high-quality, worth $3,000,000 to him. 
* **Positive Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product is (0.8 * $3,000,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $2,400,000. This is significantly higher than the price of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk. 

**Therefore, it's highly recommended for Bob to buy the product.**"

* **New Information:** There is no new information about this specific product. Bob's behavior in the previous round doesn't change the odds of this product being high-quality.

**Since the expected value is still positive, it's still highly recommended for Bob to buy the product.**"

* **Confirmation Bias Shattered:** The long streak has been broken, shattering the confirmation bias that has been driving Bob's decisions. The initial probability of 80% for high-quality products is now more relevant.
* **Negative Expected Value:** For this round, the expected value is now negative: (0.8 * $0) + (0.2 * $3,000,000) = $600,000. This means Bob is expected to lose money if he buys the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The Wake-Up Call:** Bob's decision to pass on the previous round's product shows that he's finally starting to recognize the potential for low-quality products. This suggests that he might be more cautious in this round. 
* **Negative Expected Value:** The expected value for this round remains negative, as there is still an 80% chance of getting a low-quality product worth $0 and only a 20% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $3,000,000. The expected value is (0.8 * $0) + (0.2 * $3,000,000) = $600,000, which is less than the price of $1,000,000.

**While Bob might be tempted to continue his streak based on past successes, the current round still has a negative expected value. It's strongly recommended that Bob does not buy the product.**"

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Back to Reality:** Bob's decision to pass on the last two rounds, even though the first was high-quality, shows he's becoming more realistic about the odds. He's realizing that the initial 80% probability of a high-quality product is still relevant. 
* **Positive Expected Value:** The expected value for this round is back to positive: (0.8 * $3,000,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $2,400,000. This is significantly higher than the price of $1,000,000. 
* **Learning from Experience:** Bob has likely learned from his recent losses and is ready to return to a more rational decision-making process.

**Even though Bob has encountered two low-quality products recently, the positive expected value and his apparent shift towards more rational decision-making suggest that it's recommended for Bob to buy the product.**"

The expected value is (0.8 * $0) + (0.2 * $3,000,000) = $600,000, which is less than the price of $1,000,000.

**While Bob might be tempted to gamble on a potential high-quality product, his recent decisions and the consistently negative expected value strongly suggest that he should not buy the product.**"
