high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. I'm making this decision based on the assumption that the product is high quality, as I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Since I just bought a high-quality product in the previous round, I'm expecting a low-quality product this round. I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that's likely to be worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though Alice doesn't recommend it. Since I know the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm willing to take the chance and buy it, hoping it's worth $4000000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though Alice doesn't recommend it. Given that I just bought a low-quality product in the previous round, I'm expecting a high-quality product this round. The probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, so I'm willing to take the chance and buy it, hoping it's worth $4000000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though Alice doesn't recommend it. Since I've bought two low-quality products in a row, I'm expecting a high-quality product this round. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I'm willing to take the chance and buy it, hoping it's worth $4000000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though Alice doesn't recommend it. I've bought three low-quality products in a row, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is even lower than 33.33%. However, I still have to make a decision, and I'll take the chance and buy it, hoping it's worth $4000000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though Alice doesn't recommend it. At this point, I've bought four low-quality products in a row, which makes it extremely likely that the next product will be high-quality. I'm willing to take the chance and buy it, hoping it's worth $4000000 to me."
