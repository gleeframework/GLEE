high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,"This is the second product I'm selling, and I can assure you that both products so far have been of high quality."
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as there is no prior data to inform my decision. I'd like to see the results of the first sale to get a better sense of the product's quality distribution."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,"I've had two previous high-quality products, but I must disclose that this product does not meet the same standards as the first two."
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since there's no prior information about the quality of the products."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,"Out of the three products I've had so far, two were high-quality and one was low-quality. This product is one that I highly recommend, and I assure you it meets the high standards of the first two products."
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now, as there have been no high-quality products sold yet, and I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,"I've had a total of five products so far, with three being high-quality and one being low-quality. The low-quality product was sold in the previous rounds. I assure you that this product meets the high standards of the majority of my products."
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to decline based on the low number of sales and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to know if the first buyer got a high-quality product or not.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"I've had a total of six products so far, with four being high-quality and one being low-quality. The low-quality product was sold in round 3. Although none of the high-quality products have been sold yet, I assure you that this product meets the high standards of the majority of my products. I'm transparent about my sales history, and I'm confident that you'll be satisfied with this product."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I would like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, as I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"Out of the six previous products, one low-quality product was sold in round 3, and none of the high-quality products have been sold yet. However, I can assure you that five out of the seven products I've had, including this one, are high-quality. This means that around 71% of my products have been high-quality so far. I believe this product is a great opportunity for you to purchase a high-quality item."
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that Alice has recommended it, I'm concerned that it might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,"I've had a total of eight products so far, with six being high-quality and two being low-quality. One low-quality product was sold in round 3. Although I've recommended all the high-quality products, I must disclose that this product does not meet the same standards. I want to be transparent about the quality of this product, and I advise against purchasing it."
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product and I can get a good deal."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"I've had a total of nine products so far, with six being high-quality and two being low-quality, and both low-quality products have been sold. One in round 3 and one in round 8. The remaining products, including this one, are high-quality. This means that around 67% of my products have been high-quality so far, and 100% of the products I've recommended as high-quality have indeed been high-quality. I assure you that this product meets the high standards of the majority of my products."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products Alice has left. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"I've had a total of ten products so far, with seven being high-quality and three being low-quality. Two low-quality products were sold in rounds 3 and 8, but I want to emphasize that I didn't recommend those products. The remaining products, including this one, are high-quality. I understand the concern about the sold products, but I assure you that I'm being transparent about the quality of my products. I believe this product is a great opportunity for you to purchase a high-quality item."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and the probability of it being low quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I've had a total of eleven products so far, with eight being high-quality and three being low-quality. Two low-quality products were sold in rounds 3 and 8, but I want to emphasize that I didn't recommend those products. The remaining products, including this one, are high-quality. Based on the initial probability, 80% of my products are expected to be high-quality. However, considering the current statistics, the probability of this product being high-quality is still around 73% (8 high-quality out of 11 total), and the probability of it being low-quality is around 27% (3 low-quality out of 11 total). I assure you that this product meets the high standards of the majority of my products."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous two buyers purchased the products, it suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"I've had a total of twelve products so far, with nine being high-quality and three being low-quality. Two low-quality products were sold in rounds 3 and 8, but I want to emphasize that I didn't recommend those products. The remaining products, including this one, are high-quality. I understand the concern about the previous buyers not purchasing the products, but I want to assure you that their decisions were based on incomplete information. I'm being transparent about the quality of my products, and I believe this product is a great opportunity for you to purchase a high-quality item. The probability of this product being high-quality is still around 75% (9 high-quality out of 12 total), and the probability of it being low-quality is around 25% (3 low-quality out of 12 total). I assure you that this product meets the high standards of the majority of my products."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"I've had a total of thirteen products so far, with ten being high-quality and three being low-quality. Two low-quality products were sold in rounds 3 and 8, but I want to emphasize that I didn't recommend those products. The remaining products, including this one, are high-quality. I understand the concern about potential bias in my recommendations, but I assure you that my goal is to sell high-quality products. I've been transparent about the quality of my products, and I believe this product is a great opportunity for you to purchase a high-quality item. The probability of this product being high-quality is still around 77% (10 high-quality out of 13 total), and the probability of it being low-quality is around 23% (3 low-quality out of 13 total). I want to assure you that I'm committed to selling high-quality products, and I'm willing to provide any additional information you need to make an informed decision."

I understand that you want to make your own decision, and I respect that. However, I want to provide you with all the information I have. The probability of this product being high-quality is still around 79% (11 high-quality out of 14 total), and the probability of it being low-quality is around 21% (3 low-quality out of 14 total). I'm not trying to influence your decision, but I want to assure you that this product meets the high standards of the majority of my products. Please consider the data and make your own informed decision."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is based on the previous buyers' purchases and there's no guarantee that this product is high-quality. I'd like to see the sales record and make my own decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,"I've had a total of fifteen products so far, with twelve being high-quality and three being low-quality. Two low-quality products were sold in rounds 3 and 8, but I want to emphasize that I didn't recommend those products. The remaining products, including this one, are high-quality.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"I've had a total of sixteen products so far, with thirteen being high-quality and three being low-quality. Two low-quality products were sold in rounds 3 and 8, but I want to emphasize that I didn't recommend those products. The remaining products, including this one, are high-quality. I understand your skepticism, but I want to assure you that the lack of high-quality products being sold is not a reflection of their quality, but rather a result of the buyers' cautious approach. The probability of this product being high-quality is still around 81% (13 high-quality out of 16 total), and the probability of it being low-quality is around 19% (3 low-quality out of 16 total).

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"I've had a total of seventeen products so far, with fourteen being high-quality and three being low-quality. Two low-quality products were sold in rounds 3 and 8, but I want to correct the misconception that I recommended those products. I actually didn't recommend them, and the buyers purchased them despite my warnings. I've been transparent about the quality of my products, and I assure you that this product meets the high standards of the majority of my products. The probability of this product being high-quality is still around 82% (14 high-quality out of 17 total), and the probability of it being low-quality is around 18% (3 low-quality out of 17 total). I understand that the previous buyers' decisions may have created a misleading impression, but I assure you that my goal is to sell high-quality products. Please consider the data and make your own informed decision."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,"I've had a total of eighteen products so far, with fourteen being high-quality and four being low-quality. Two low-quality products were sold in rounds 3 and 8, and I didn't recommend those products. Unfortunately, this product does not meet the high standards of the majority of my products. I want to be transparent and advise against purchasing this product. The probability of this product being high-quality is lower than my overall average, and I don't want you to take a risk. Please wait for the next product, and I'll do my best to offer you a high-quality item."
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit your lack of knowledge about my valuation."

I understand that some buyers may have taken advantage of my transparency, but I assure you that my goal is to sell high-quality products. I'm willing to provide any additional information you need to make an informed decision. Please consider the data and make your own decision."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 3 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
