With that said, I still believe this product is one of the best I have, and I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000. It's a risk, but I think it's worth it.",
,,Bob,4,"Given the information you've provided about the recent trend in high-quality products and the attractive price, I think it's worth taking a chance.

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're willing to take the calculated risk! However, I want to caution you that the streak can't last forever. I've already had 3 high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that I might be due for a low-quality one. That being said, this product is still one of the best I have, and I think it's worth the investment.

With that said, this product is still one of the best I have, and I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000. I'll also throw in a 10-year warranty, which is twice the standard warranty period. I think it's a great deal, and I hope you'll consider it.",
,,Bob,6,"Considering the transparency about the potential change in quality trends and the attractive offer of a longer warranty, I think this is a good opportunity to secure a high-quality product at a reasonable price.

I've already sold 4 high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that I've been lucky rather than good. I'm not saying that this product isn't high-quality, but I want to be upfront with you about the risks. With that said, I'm still willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000.

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm glad we could establish a new level of trust and transparency in our negotiations. However, I want to let you know that I've been thinking about the fact that you've bought 6 high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm just getting lucky. I'm not trying to be paranoid, but I want to make sure you're aware of the risks. This product is indeed high-quality, but I'm not as confident in its quality as I was in the previous ones.

I want to give you a chance to walk away with a special offer. I'll give you the product for free, but you have to agree to keep our business relationship confidential. I'm not looking to sell any more products, and I want to ensure that you're taken care of. What do you think?",
,,Bob,14,"While I appreciate the gesture of offering the product for free and the confidentiality request, I believe it's important to maintain fairness and transparency in all transactions.

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement! However, I want to let you know that I've been thinking about our conversations, and I realize that I've been trying to find ways to sell you products without fully considering your needs.
