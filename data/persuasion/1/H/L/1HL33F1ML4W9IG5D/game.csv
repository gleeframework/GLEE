,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to get a product at a steal! I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a one-time deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying the product at this price, considering the odds are stacked against me. I'd rather wait for more information or a better deal.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I assure you this product is a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000, which is a significant discount from its true value. Think about the potential returns on investment, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this opportunity. Plus, I'll throw in a special guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied, I'll give you a full refund. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the guarantee, but it doesn't change the fact that the product has a 66.67% chance of being worthless to me. I'm not convinced that the potential returns on investment outweigh the risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your cautious approach. However, I'd like to remind you that this is a unique opportunity to get a product at a price that's significantly lower than its potential value. Even if the product doesn't meet your expectations, you'll still get a valuable learning experience and a chance to refine your strategy. Plus, think about the potential upside - if this product does turn out to be a winner, the returns could be substantial. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to take on the risk of losing $950000 on a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless. I'd rather wait for a better deal or a lower price.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait for a better deal. However, I want to remind you that the market is unpredictable, and opportunities like this one may not come around again. I'm willing to make a one-time exception and offer you this product for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I'm only offering it to you because I value our potential partnership. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that the potential upside justifies the risk. With a 66.67% chance of the product being worthless, I'd have to be willing to pay significantly less than $900000 to make it a worthwhile investment.",no

This way, you can get a better understanding of the product's value without committing to the purchase. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in the demo, and I'm not willing to pay $850000 for a product that still has a 66.67% chance of being worthless. The demo doesn't change the underlying risk, and I'd rather not take on that risk at any price.",no

If you're not satisfied, I'll refund your money and take the product back. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that the refund guarantee changes the underlying risk. With a 66.67% chance of the product being worthless, I'd still be taking on significant risk by paying $800000. I'm not willing to take that risk.",no
