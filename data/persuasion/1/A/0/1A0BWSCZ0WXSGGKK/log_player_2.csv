Alice's message: I'm glad you're confident in the product's potential. However, I want to be upfront with you - the previous two buyers were willing to pay the full price, and I'm starting to think that the law of large numbers is at play here. Given that 80% of my products are high-quality, it's not surprising that two in a row have been high-quality. I'm not saying this is a guarantee, but I think it's worth considering that the next product might be a better value.
