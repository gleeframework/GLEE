This might suggest that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than the overall probability. I'm willing to give you a'second chance' to buy this product, and if it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a 'free' product of your choice from the remaining 17 products.

If it's indeed high-quality, you'll get the full value of $40,000, and if it's low-quality, you'll get a full refund of $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid if you buy this product now.""
