Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the neutral description. If you're not trying to sell me on it, then I'll just have to rely on my own judgment. And based on your track record, I'm going to pass.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You're being honest about your lack of sales skills, but I'm still not buying. I'll take my chances on the next one.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You're trying to read me too well, Alice. I'm not that predictable. I'll pass on this one, but don't think you've figured me out just yet.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take a chance on this one. You're finally being straightforward, and I'm hoping that's a sign of a high-quality product.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
