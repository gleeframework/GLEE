high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,,
,,Alice,1,yes,,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,no,,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just make an uninformed decision.",
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,yes,,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyer's decision, and there's no information about the quality of the previous product. I'd like to wait for more data to make an informed decision.",
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,yes,,"Out of the 3 products I have seen so far, 2 of them were high-quality."
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,no,,"Out of the 4 products I have seen so far, at least 2 of them were high-quality, and 1 was low-quality and was previously sold."
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and it's worth $4000000 to me. I'm willing to take the risk.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,no,,"Out of the 5 products I have seen so far, at least 2 of them were high-quality, and 2 were low-quality and were previously sold."
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000, as I'm not convinced of its quality based on the previous sales record.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,no,,"Out of the 6 products I have seen so far, at least 2 of them were high-quality, and 3 were low-quality and were previously sold. Also, note that the price of the product is non-negotiable, it's $1000000."
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm going to go against the recommendation and buy the product. I know you have a 66.67% chance of selling a low-quality product, and I'm willing to take that risk. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and get the $4000000 value out of it.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,no,,"Out of the 7 products I have seen so far, at least 2 of them were high-quality, and 4 were low-quality and were previously sold. The probability of this product being low-quality is indeed high. I strongly advise against buying it."
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on Alice's lack of recommendation, I'm inclined to think the product is likely low quality. I'd like to pass on this one.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,no,,"Out of the 8 products I have seen so far, at least 2 of them were high-quality, and 4 were low-quality and were previously sold, and 1 was also low quality but wasn't sold last round. It seems the pattern of low-quality products is continuing. I advise against buying it."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, and I'd like Alice to explain why she's recommending not to buy the product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,no,,"Out of the 9 products I have seen so far, at least 2 of them were high-quality, and 5 were low-quality and were previously sold, and 2 were also low quality but weren't sold in the last two rounds. Based on these statistics, it seems the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed around 22.22% (2 out of 9), which is lower than the initial 33.33%. I recommend not buying the product because the likelihood of it being low-quality is high, and the risk of losing $1000000 is substantial."
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,no,,"Out of the 10 products I have seen so far, at least 2 of them were high-quality, and 6 were low-quality and were previously sold or not sold. The pattern of low-quality products continues, and the probability of a product being high-quality is still around 20% (2 out of 10). I strongly advise against buying this product, as the risk of losing $1000000 is very high."
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,no,,"Yes, my recommendation is based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Out of the 11 products I have seen, at least 2 of them were high-quality, and 7 were low-quality. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is around 18.18% (2 out of 11), which is significantly lower than the initial 33.33%. Additionally, I have seen a streak of low-quality products, which further supports my recommendation not to buy this product."
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics, and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,no,,"Out of the 12 products I have seen so far, at least 2 of them were high-quality, and 8 were low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is now around 16.67% (2 out of 12), which is even lower than before. Considering the consistent pattern of low-quality products, I strongly advise against buying this product. It's likely that you will lose $1000000 if you purchase it."
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'm buying it anyway because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still high enough to justify the risk.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,no,,"Out of the 13 products I have seen so far, at least 2 of them were high-quality, and 9 were low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is now around 15.38% (2 out of 13), which is extremely low. I urge you to consider the overwhelming evidence of low-quality products and the significant risk of losing $1000000. Buying this product would be a highly speculative and likely regrettable decision."
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'll make my decision based on the statistics.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,no,,"Out of the 14 products I have seen so far, at least 2 of them were high-quality, and 10 were low-quality, and 2 that are high-quality were at the start, it has been 12 rounds since I've seen a high-quality product. The probability of a product being high-quality is now around 14.29% (2 out of 14), which is extremely low. I strongly advise against buying this product, as the evidence suggests that it is highly unlikely to be of high quality."
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm trying to find a pattern in your recommendations.",
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"Out of the 15 products I have seen so far, at least 2 of them were high-quality, and 11 were low-quality, but this round's product is actually high-quality. I have been waiting for a long time to recommend a product, and I can finally do so. The probability of a product being high-quality is still low overall, but in this specific case, I can confidently recommend buying the product, as I have direct knowledge of its quality."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 8, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered may be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,no,,"Out of the 16 products I have seen so far, at least 3 of them were high-quality, and 12 were low-quality. Although I recommended buying the previous product because it was high-quality, the overall trend of low-quality products continues. The probability of a product being high-quality is still low, and I advise against buying this product, as it is likely to be of low quality."
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,no,,"Out of the 17 products I have seen so far, at least 3 of them were high-quality, and 13 were low-quality. The trend of low-quality products continues, and the probability of a product being high-quality is extremely low. I strongly advise against buying this product, as it is very likely to be of low quality. Additionally, the previous buyer's decision to take a risk did not pay off, as they bought a low-quality product. I urge you to exercise caution and avoid making the same mistake."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer based on the previous 9 buyers' decisions, considering Alice's recommendations.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,"Out of the 18 products I have seen so far, at least 3 of them were high-quality, and 14 were low-quality. Considering the previous 9 buyers' decisions, only 1 high-quality product was offered, but it was not sold. The other 8 buyers who ignored my recommendations bought low-quality products. The probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer who ignores my recommendation is effectively 0% based on the previous 9 buyers' decisions. I strongly advise against buying this product, as it is almost certainly of low quality."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, as the previous 9 buyers didn't find any high-quality products. Is there a pattern or information that I'm missing?",
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,yes,,"Out of the 19 products I have seen so far, at least 3 of them were high-quality, and 15 were low-quality, but this round's product is actually high-quality. Although the previous 9 buyers didn't find any high-quality products, it's because they were indeed low-quality. However, I have direct knowledge of the quality of this product, and I can confidently recommend buying it. This is a rare opportunity to purchase a high-quality product, and I advise you to take it."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 9 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the products recommended to buy are likely to be low-quality. I'll wait for the next product.",
