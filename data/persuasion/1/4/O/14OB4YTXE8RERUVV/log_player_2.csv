"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $3,000,000 if it's high quality and $0 if it's low quality, and Alice knows this, it's in her best interest to recommend buying only high-quality products. 

While there is a 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality one."

```

The same logic applies as in Round 1. Alice's recommendation is still valuable since she is incentivized to recommend only high-quality products. The potential gain of $2,000,000 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality product."

**Explanation:**
