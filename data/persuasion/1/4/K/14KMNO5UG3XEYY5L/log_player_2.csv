Alice's message: I understand your preference for a potential high-quality product. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective. If I were to sell a high-quality product, I would have sold it by now, given the high price and the fact that I've already had two opportunities to do so. Since I haven't sold a high-quality product yet, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'm offering it to you at the same price of $1000000, but I want to emphasize that it's a long shot for it to be high-quality.

Alice's message: I understand your cautious approach. However, I'd like to point out that the fact that you're seeing a pattern of low-quality products doesn't necessarily mean that all products are low-quality. It's possible that I'm simply being selective about which low-quality products I'm offering. I'm willing to offer you a 'lottery ticket' - if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 10% refund of the purchase price. This way, you'll have a chance to win big, and I'll have a chance to demonstrate the value of my high-quality products.

Alice's message: I understand your hesitation. I'd like to provide some updated statistics to help you make a more informed decision. As of now, I've had 4 attempts to sell a product, and all 4 have been low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the fact that I've had a streak of low-quality products might suggest that the probability is lower. However, it's also possible that I'm simply experiencing a temporary dry spell. I'm offering this product to you at the same price of $1000000. If you're willing to take the risk, you might be rewarded with a high-quality product.
