This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say?""}"
"The buyer's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer and the discount, but I'm hesitant to buy based on the current information. While your previous sales record shows a high percentage of high-quality products, it's still a small sample size. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.

"The buyer's message: Alice, while I appreciate your confidence in your products,  the statistics still indicate a 20% chance of a low-quality product, which is a risk I'm not willing to take at this price. Perhaps if the price was adjusted or there was a better track record, I would reconsider.

I think this is a reasonable compromise given the odds. What do you think?""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the risk. While the recent sales trend is encouraging, the initial 20% chance of getting a low-quality product is still too high for me.  I'm going to pass on this one.

This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product with a nice bonus. What do you think?""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the bonus, but I'm still hesitant. The statistics show that only 1 out of 5 buyers who purchased based on your recommendation got a high-quality product.  While the overall ratio of high-quality products seems favorable,  I'm not comfortable risking $7000 with such a low success rate. I'll pass for now.

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the recent success rate is tempting, I'm still hesitant to buy.

"The buyer's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While the recent success rate is tempting, I'm still hesitant to make a purchase based on a single data point.
