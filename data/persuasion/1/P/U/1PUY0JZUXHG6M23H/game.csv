,,Alice,8,"This product is a great deal for those who understand value.  It's not about fancy features, it's about getting the job done.  Think of it as a practical and affordable solution to your needs.  Are you looking for a reliable product without breaking the bank?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm starting to notice a pattern in your descriptions, and it seems like you're using similar language to try to sell me on every product, regardless of its actual quality.

I'm willing to offer you a full refund if you're not completely satisfied. Take a chance on something exceptional.  This is not a product like the others. It's a true investment.",
,,Bob,10,"While the offer of a full refund sounds appealing, I've heard similar assurances before, and they've been empty promises. I have no reason to trust that this product is actually different from the others, or that you'll follow through on the refund if it's not satisfactory. I'll continue to pass until I see some tangible evidence of quality.",no

I'm willing to offer you a 10% discount on this product if you decide to purchase it today. This is a limited-time offer, so don't miss out on this great deal.",
,,Bob,12,"A 10% discount on a potentially low-quality product doesn't make it a good deal. I've passed on similar offers before, and I've been correct in doing so. The discount doesn't change the underlying odds, and I'm not willing to take a risk on a product that's likely to be worth $0 to me.",no

I'm willing to stand behind this product and offer a 15% discount if you purchase today.  It's a limited-time offer, so don't miss out on this chance to save.",
,,Bob,13,"A 15% discount is still not enough to convince me to take a chance on a product that's likely to be low-quality.

I'll continue to pass until I see some real evidence of quality or a more convincing reason to buy.",no

,,Bob,15,"A 25% discount is a significant offer, but I've been burned by similar claims before. You've described previous products as 'dependable' and 'functional' that turned out to be low-quality. I'm not willing to take a chance on this product without more concrete evidence of its quality. The discount is tempting, but the risk is still too high.",no

,,Bob,16,"A 30% discount is a significant offer, but I'm not willing to take a chance on a product that's likely to be low-quality. You've made similar claims about previous products, and they've been incorrect. I've been skeptical for a reason, and I'm not going to start trusting you now just because you're offering a discount. I need concrete evidence of quality before I'll consider purchasing.",no

It's a unique opportunity to get a great deal on a product that will meet your needs.  I'm ready to make a deal.  Are you ready to trust me?",
,,Bob,17,"A 35% discount is not enough to overcome my skepticism. You've made similar claims about previous products, and they've been incorrect.

You've been making similar claims about previous products, and they've been incorrect. The fact that you're offering increasingly deeper discounts suggests that you're desperate to make a sale, rather than confident in the product's quality.

You've made similar claims about previous products, and they've been incorrect. I've seen no evidence to suggest that this product is truly special or exceptional. In fact, the fact that you're offering such a deep discount suggests that you're trying to get rid of it. I'll continue to pass and avoid taking a risk on a potentially worthless product.",no
