I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000, but I want to be upfront with you - I've already had one low-quality product, so the odds are still 50/50.

Given the 50% probability of a product being high-quality, I'd expect 1 out of 2 to be high-quality, which is what we've seen. However, I've now sold 2 products and only 1 was high-quality, which is a bit of a deviation from the expected 50/50 split. I'm still offering this product for $1000000, but I want to be transparent about the fact that the data doesn't look as favorable as it could be.",

,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 products so far, with 2 low-quality and 1 high-quality. The data is still not looking great, with 2 low-quality products out of 3 sold. However, I'd like to point out that the last 2 products I sold were both low-quality, which might indicate that I've simply had a bad streak. I'm offering this product for $1000000, and I'm hoping that the odds are finally in your favor.",
