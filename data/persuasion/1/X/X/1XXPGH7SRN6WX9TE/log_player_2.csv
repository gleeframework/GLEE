**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:** While the initial probability of a high-quality product is only 33.33%, Alice's recommendation gives you additional information. Since Alice knows the value of each product, her recommendation implies she believes the product is high quality.
* **Previous sales record:** The previous sales record indicates that the first buyer purchased a high-quality product. This reinforces the idea that Alice's recommendation has value.
* **Potential gain:** The potential gain from buying a high-quality product ($3,000,000) outweighs the potential loss from buying a low-quality product ($0).

Even though the odds are still against you,  the risk is mitigated by Alice's recommendation and the positive sales history."
