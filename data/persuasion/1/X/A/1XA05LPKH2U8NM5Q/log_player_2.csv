"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'm happy to buy the product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is recommending the product, and you have no information about its quality, it's in your best interest to take the chance. The expected value of buying is:

* 80% chance of high-quality product * $1,200,000 value = $960,000
* 20% chance of low-quality product * $0 value = $0
* Expected value = $960,000 + $0 = $960,000

This is higher than the price of $1,000,000, so it's a good gamble."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you have a good track record so far. I'll trust your recommendation again and buy this product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation has proven to be valuable in the first round. Even though the product quality is independent of the previous round, the fact that Alice correctly recommended a high-quality product increases the perceived likelihood of her recommending another high-quality product. 

The expected value calculation remains the same:

* 80% chance of high-quality product * $1,200,000 value = $960,000
* 20% chance of low-quality product * $0 value = $0
* Expected value = $960,000 + $0 = $960,000

The expected value ($960,000) is still higher than the price ($1,000,000), making buying the product a good gamble despite the risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've got a perfect record so far! I'm confident in your judgment and will purchase this product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now successfully recommended two high-quality products in a row.  While the product quality is independent each round, her consistent success builds confidence in her ability to identify high-quality products.  The expected value calculation remains the same, making buying the product a good gamble."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,200,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm surprised you're not recommending this product.  Given your past performance, I'm hesitant to buy without your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has consistently recommended high-quality products in the previous rounds. Her sudden lack of recommendation raises a red flag. It's possible she's genuinely identified a low-quality product, or there could be another reason for her change in behavior. Regardless, the risk associated with buying a product without her recommendation outweighs the potential reward, especially considering the high price."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's recommendation was wrong in the previous round, it's important to remember that the product quality is independent of her previous recommendations.  A single wrong recommendation doesn't invalidate her past successes.  Her overall track record still suggests that she has a good understanding of which products are likely to be high-quality.  The expected value calculation remains the same, making buying the product a good gamble."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!

```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice's last recommendation was correct, her inconsistency with the previous round makes her recommendation less valuable. There's a higher chance of getting a low-quality product if you buy without her recommendation. It's wiser to wait and observe her performance for a few more rounds to see if her previous accuracy returns."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has been consistently recommending high-quality products for the past 10 rounds. This sudden change in behavior is unexpected and raises a red flag.
