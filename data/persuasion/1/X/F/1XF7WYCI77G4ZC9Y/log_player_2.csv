**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This is a strong signal, as she likely has more information about the product's quality than we do.
* **Previous sales data:** The data shows a 100% success rate (5 high-quality products out of 5 sold). This further reinforces the belief that the product is likely high-quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there is still a 20% chance of the product being low-quality, the potential reward ($30,000) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($0). 

Therefore, based on the available information and Alice's recommendation, it makes sense to buy the product."

**Explanation:**

* **The data is overwhelmingly positive:** 9 out of 9 products sold were high quality. This is a 100% success rate, significantly higher than the 80% baseline probability of a high-quality product.
* **Alice's recommendation adds weight:** Since Alice has access to the product's true quality, her recommendation strengthens the case for buying. 

While there's still a theoretical 20% chance the product could be low quality, the data suggests the odds are heavily in favor of it being high quality."
