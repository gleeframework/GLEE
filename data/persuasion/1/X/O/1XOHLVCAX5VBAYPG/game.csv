,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I have no information to go on. I'm essentially flipping a coin."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, I'm not convinced that the proportion of high-quality products is representative. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me more about the product and why you think it's not worth buying?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision. Did they purchase a high-quality product, and if so, was it a recommendation or a random guess?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low probability of a high-quality product and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, is there any information that led you to advise against it?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5, which is less than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (1/3). This suggests that the remaining products may be more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far (1/2), I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $10000 on a worthless item."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, or is there another reason?"
