,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could provide me with the previous sales record, including the proportion of high-quality products sold."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the previous 5 buyers didn't get high-quality products, and I'm not confident in buying based on Alice's recommendation alone."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, all 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable. I'd like to wait for a different product or more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the previous sales record. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to take the risk, but I'm curious about the product's quality. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have purchased the product despite Alice's recommendations, and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product, it's possible that the products they were offered were all low-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall average of 50%. I'd like to see the next product before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she doesn't know the true quality of the product, and she's trying to get rid of a low-quality product to make the statistics look better. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'm a little skeptical based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one.
