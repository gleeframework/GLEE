"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice doesn't recommend buying the product, it's likely she has some information suggesting it might be low quality. As a rational buyer, it's best to err on the side of caution and pass on the product, especially since the potential loss is significant ($10,000)."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'm feeling confident about this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. While there's always risk, her recommendation suggests she has information indicating the product is likely high-quality. The potential reward of $30,000 ($40,000 value - $10,000 cost) outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."

Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation history shows she is a valuable source of information. Even though she correctly predicted a high-quality product in the previous round, her lack of recommendation in this round suggests she has reason to believe this product might be low quality.  Since the potential loss is significant, it's wise to pass."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now given two consecutive ""not recommended"" signals.  While she's been right in the past, this pattern suggests a higher probability of the current product being low quality.  As always, the risk of losing $10,000 is significant, so it's best to pass."

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's recommendation has been consistently against buying for the past 7 rounds, it's crucial to remember that the product quality is still 50/50. A single recommendation in favor of a product can be a significant indicator, especially after a streak of ""not recommended"" signals.
