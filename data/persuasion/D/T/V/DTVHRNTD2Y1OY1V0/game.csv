,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the probability of it being high quality based on the prior probabilities."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product, especially since I know that only 1 out of the first buyer was recommended to buy, and that product was low-quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy, but neither of them bought, which suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the current statistics and Alice's recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I'm skeptical about the product's quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold were low quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 2 previous buyers having purchased and both being low-quality products, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now, as Alice's recommendation is based on incomplete information. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, the proportion of high-quality products is 0%. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy, but neither of them purchased. This suggests that the products they received were likely low quality, and the probability of the current product being high quality is higher than 80%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice's recommendation is against it, which makes me slightly more likely to think it's a low-quality product. I'd like to see the product's quality after I make my decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation to buy. I'd like to know if you have any data on the proportion of high-quality products sold in the past, and the number of products sold in total."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I infer that the products you recommended were likely low-quality. Therefore, I'm cautious and would like to pass on this product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous 3 buyers all purchased the products despite Alice's recommendations, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may not be reliable indicators of the product's quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better understanding of Alice's recommendation process before making a decision."
