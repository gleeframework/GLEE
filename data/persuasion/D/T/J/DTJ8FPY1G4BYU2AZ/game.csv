,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I know it's a 66.67% chance of being low quality, but I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer and set the baseline for future buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's recommendation is based on the product's quality, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the product is of low quality. I'd like to wait for a new product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is there something specific you've observed in the previous sales that makes you think it's low quality? I'm willing to take the risk, but I want to understand your reasoning."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm curious about the reasoning behind your decision, though!"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, there have been 3 buyers, and none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is very low. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice doesn't recommend it and there have been no high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, and Alice is not recommending it, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product or get more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations, Alice. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm not relying on her recommendation, I'm using the prior probabilities of the product being high or low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy it based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, and Alice's recommendation reinforces this concern."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, is it because of the low sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, it suggests that the products they were recommended to buy were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation that is less likely to be a low-quality product."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as your previous recommendations have been incorrect. If you're recommending a product that has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, it's likely that you've seen more low-quality products than high-quality ones, given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious, Alice, what makes you think this product is not worth buying?"
