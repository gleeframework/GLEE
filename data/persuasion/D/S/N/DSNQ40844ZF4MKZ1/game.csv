,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I know the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'd like to get some information for the future buyers."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience. Did they buy a high-quality or low-quality product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I'd like to take the chance."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the sales record and the recommendation is not strong enough to make a decision with the current information.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm basing my decision on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations. Given that none of the previous buyers bought the products, it suggests that the products they were offered were likely low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that it's high-quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not buying based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. It seems like your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the low sales record or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 5 buyers all passed on the products after your recommendations, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than the 33.33% chance I initially thought. I'd like to take the chance to possibly get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers who received recommendations from you purchased the product, and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to take a risk and pass on the product. I'm hoping that the 7th product will be high-quality, and I don't want to be the 7th buyer to get a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the 6 previous buyers who bought and got a low-quality product, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that the previous buyers have all been recommended to buy, but none of the products were high quality. This suggests that Alice may not have a reliable method for determining the product's quality, or that the products sold to the previous buyers were all low quality. I'd like to wait and observe more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers were discouraged from buying, I suspect that the products offered so far are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a product that Alice recommends, which might be a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I'm not basing my decision on Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain why you don't think I should buy this product?"
