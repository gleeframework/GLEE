Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I'd like to point out that a single low-quality product would have been sold in the first round, given the 20% chance of it being low-quality. Since that didn't happen, it's possible that the low-quality product is still waiting to be sold. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 so far, and I'm willing to offer this next one to you for $100. It's a great opportunity to get a $300 product at a discount. I'll let you decide.

The probability of getting 3 high-quality products in a row, given an 80% chance of each product being high-quality, is actually quite low. It's approximately 51.2% (0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512).
