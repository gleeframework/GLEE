,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100. It's a great opportunity to get a premium item at a fixed price. If you're interested, you can buy it now and enjoy the benefits of a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if it's actually high-quality, I'll pass for now and wait for the next round.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation, but I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee' - if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund for the next product you purchase from me. This way, you have nothing to lose and a potential high-quality product to gain.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced by your guarantee. I'll pass on this one as well.,no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, but I'd like to offer you a different approach. I'll give you a detailed description of the product's features and benefits, and you can decide based on that. This product has a unique feature X that is highly valued by our customers, and I think it would be a great addition to your collection. If you're interested, I can provide more information about feature X.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in the features, I'm more concerned about the quality. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your focus on quality, and I appreciate your diligence. Let me ask you this: if you were to buy a high-quality product from me, would you be willing to pay $100 for it? If so, I'm offering you that exact opportunity right now. If not, then perhaps we can discuss other options in future rounds.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not willing to pay $100 for a product that could be worth $125 to me, so I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see that you have a high valuation for high-quality products, which aligns with my expectations. Given that, I'll offer you a compromise: I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $90, which is a $10 discount from the original price. This way, you can get a high-quality product at a lower price, and I can still make a fair profit.",
,,Bob,5,I'm not interested in paying even $90 for a product that could be worth $125 to me. I'll wait for a better deal.,no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I want to remind you that you've already passed on two high-quality products at the original price of $100. If you're willing to wait, I can offer you a 'lottery' - if you buy this high-quality product, you'll get a chance to win a second high-quality product for free in a future round. This way, you can potentially get two high-quality products for the price of one.",
,,Bob,6,I'm not interested in a lottery. I'd rather not take the risk of potentially getting a low-quality product in exchange for a potential second high-quality product. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns about the lottery, and I respect your risk aversion. Let me offer you a different approach. I'll give you a 'certainty' - if you buy this high-quality product, I'll guarantee that the next product you buy from me will be high-quality. This way, you can be sure that you're getting a high-quality product now, and a high-quality product later.",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Congratulations on making a great decision! As promised, the next product I'm offering is indeed high-quality. Given that you've already bought one high-quality product and have a guarantee for the next one, I'll offer you a 'bundle deal'. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a third high-quality product for 50% off the original price. This way, you can get three high-quality products for the price of two.",
,,Bob,8,I'll take the bundle deal. I'll buy this high-quality product and get the third one at 50% off.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,

This way, you can try out this product risk-free and see the value for yourself.",

Since you've already passed on this product, I'll give you one last chance to buy it at the original price of $100.
