**Explanation:**

* **Limited Information:** There is very little information to go on. Only one product has been sold and it was high quality. This doesn't tell us much about the overall quality of Alice's products. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Even though she might not know the exact value of the product to you, her recommendation suggests she believes it's worth buying.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($20,000) is significant, even though the risk of a low-quality product ($0) is also substantial.  
* **Early Stage:** Since this is early in the game, it's worth taking a calculated risk. 

**The key here is to acknowledge the limited information, but also trust Alice's recommendation as a valuable piece of evidence.**"

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the recommendation. I'm confident enough to purchase the product based on the sales record and your recommendation. ""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, indicating she believes the product is likely high quality.
* **Favorable Sales Record:**  A 50% success rate (1 high-quality out of 2 sales) is significantly better than the expected 33.33% chance of a high-quality product.  
* **Potential for Profit:** Even with a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, the potential $10,000 profit from a high-quality product makes it worth the risk."
