We've sold 0 products so far, and we're eager to start our journey with you. What do you say? Will you take the chance and buy our product for $1000000?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the current statistics. Since no products have been sold yet, I'm assuming the prior probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. If I buy, I'll be updating this probability based on the quality of the product. Please let me know if this is correct.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to our next product! As you've noticed, our previous buyer took the chance and purchased our product. Since they've bought one high-quality product out of a total of 1 product, the updated probability of our product being high-quality is now 100% (1/1). However, we'd like to clarify that this is a single data point and doesn't necessarily reflect the overall quality distribution. We're still at the beginning of our sales journey, and we're eager to continue. With this in mind, would you like to take a chance on our product for $1000000? Keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is now 100%, but there's always an element of uncertainty.",

With this in mind, would you like to take a chance on our product for $1000000? Keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, and we're still at the beginning of our sales journey.",
