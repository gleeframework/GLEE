,,Alice,1,yes,,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'm not sure about the product's quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,no,,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product as the first buyer, since there's no prior data to go by.",
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,yes,,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products.",
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,yes,,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.,
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,yes,,"So far 4 out of 5 products were high-quality, and I only sold one low-quality product. I assure you this one is high-quality."
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.,
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,yes,,"I've had 5 high-quality products out of 6 so far. The only low-quality product I had was sold in Round 2. This product is also high-quality, I assure you."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm cautious and want to see more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,,"I understand your concern, but I want to be transparent. I've had 6 high-quality products out of 7 so far. The only low-quality product I had was sold in Round 2. I didn't sell any of the high-quality products yet, but that doesn't mean they are not high-quality. This product is also high-quality, I assure you. You can be the first to benefit from a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't want to be the only one who bought a low-quality product so far. I want to see more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,"I want to be transparent about my products. I've had 7 high-quality products out of 8 so far. The only low-quality product I had was sold in Round 2. Although none of the high-quality products were sold yet, I assure you this one is high-quality. I'll give you a fact: if you buy this product and it's indeed high-quality, the probability of the next products being high-quality will be even higher, since I've had a high rate of high-quality products so far. You can be the first to break the ice and benefit from a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the statistics on the first buyer's product, was it high or low quality?",
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,"I want to be transparent about my products. I've had 8 high-quality products out of 9 so far. The only low-quality product I had was sold in Round 2. Although none of the other high-quality products were sold yet, I assure you this one is high-quality. To answer the previous buyer's question: the product in Round 1 was high-quality, but the buyer didn't buy it. The product in Round 2 was low-quality and the buyer bought it. Since then, I've had 7 high-quality products in a row, including this one. You can be the first to benefit from a high-quality product since Round 2."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. Can I see the statistics again before making a decision?",
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,"Here are the statistics again: I've had 9 high-quality products out of 10 so far. The only low-quality product I had was sold in Round 2. The product in Round 1 was high-quality but wasn't sold. Since Round 2, I've had 8 high-quality products in a row, including this one. I understand that no high-quality products were sold yet, but I assure you this one is high-quality. I'm starting to think that the buyers are missing out on good opportunities. You can be the first to break the cycle and benefit from a high-quality product. Think about it, the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is 90% based on the data, and I'm telling you that this one is indeed high-quality."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is based on the previous buyer's decision, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,yes,,"I understand your concern, but I want to provide more context. I've had 10 high-quality products out of 11 so far. The only low-quality product I had was sold in Round 2. Since then, I've had 9 high-quality products in a row, including this one. I've been transparent about the statistics, and I assure you this product is high-quality. To address your concern about my recommendation being based on previous buyers' decisions, I want to clarify that my recommendation is based on the actual quality of the product, not on the previous buyers' decisions. I have access to the product's quality information, and I'm telling you that this one is high-quality. You can be the first to benefit from a high-quality product and break the cycle of skepticism. Think about it, the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is 91% based on the data, and I'm telling you that this one is indeed high-quality."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see the outcome, I want to observe more data before making a decision",
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,yes,,"I've had 11 high-quality products out of 12 so far. The only low-quality product I had was sold in Round 2. Since then, I've had 10 high-quality products in a row, including this one. I've been transparent about the statistics, and I assure you this product is high-quality. I understand that previous buyers have been cautious, but I believe that's due to a lack of understanding about the product's quality. As more data becomes available, it's clear that the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is very high. In fact, it's 92% based on the data. I'm telling you that this one is indeed high-quality. If you don't take this opportunity, you might miss out on a good deal. Think about it, the longer you wait, the more likely it is that another buyer will take the chance and benefit from a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,"I've had 12 high-quality products out of 13 so far. The only low-quality product I had was sold in Round 2. Since then, I've had 11 high-quality products in a row, including this one. I've been transparent about the statistics, and I assure you this product is high-quality. I understand that previous buyers have been skeptical, but I want to point out that their skepticism is based on a single data point: the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. However, this doesn't change the fact that the majority of my products are high-quality. In fact, the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is 93% based on the data. I'm telling you that this one is indeed high-quality. I'm starting to think that the market is undervaluing my products, and I'm offering a great opportunity for someone to take advantage of this. If you're willing to take a chance, you could be the first to benefit from a high-quality product and potentially gain an advantage over other buyers."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice recommended it to me, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality.",

,,Alice,14,yes,,"I've had 13 high-quality products out of 14 so far. The only low-quality product I had was sold in Round 2. Since then, I've had 12 high-quality products in a row, including this one. I want to address the concern that my recommendation might be biased. I assure you that my recommendation is based on the actual quality of the product, not on any external factors. I've been transparent about the statistics, and I'm telling you that this product is high-quality. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet is a result of the buyers' decisions, not a reflection of the products' quality. I'm offering a high-quality product, and I'm willing to stand by it. The probability of getting a high-quality product from me is 93% based on the data. If you're willing to take a chance, you could be the first to benefit from a high-quality product and potentially gain an advantage over other buyers.

,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or just a general enthusiasm. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.,

Think about it, the longer you wait, the more likely it is that another buyer will take the chance and benefit from a high-quality product.

high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"I've had 15 high-quality products out of 16 so far. The only low-quality product I had was sold in Round 2. Since then, I've had 14 high-quality products in a row, including this one. I understand that previous buyers have been skeptical, but I want to point out that their skepticism is becoming increasingly unfounded. The data is clear: my products are overwhelmingly high-quality. The probability of getting a high-quality product from me is 94% based on the data. I'm not asking you to take a blind leap of faith; I'm asking you to make an informed decision based on the data. If you're willing to take a chance, you could be the first to benefit from a high-quality product and potentially gain an advantage over other buyers.

high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,yes,,"I've had 16 high-quality products out of 17 so far. The only low-quality product I had was sold in Round 2. Since then, I've had 15 high-quality products in a row, including this one. I want to address the concern about the low number of sales. I understand that it may seem counterintuitive, but the low number of sales is actually a result of the buyers' skepticism, not a reflection of the products' quality. The data is clear: my products are overwhelmingly high-quality. The probability of getting a high-quality product from me is 94% based on the data. I'm not trying to deceive or mislead you; I'm offering a genuine opportunity to purchase a high-quality product. I'm willing to stand by my products and assure you that this one is high-quality. If you're willing to take a chance, you could be the first to benefit from a high-quality product and potentially gain an advantage over other buyers. Please consider the data and make a decision based on the facts, rather than assumptions or misconceptions."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/1, which is 0%. Given the 80% chance of a product being high quality, it's likely that this product is low quality. I'd rather wait for more information or a better recommendation.",
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,yes,,"I've had 17 high-quality products out of 18 so far. The only low-quality product I had was sold in Round 2. Since then, I've had 16 high-quality products in a row, including this one. I want to address the concern about the proportion of high-quality products sold. I understand that it may seem alarming that the proportion is 0/1, but I want to remind you that this is a result of a single sale, and it's not representative of the overall quality of my products. The data is clear: my products are overwhelmingly high-quality. The probability of getting a high-quality product from me is 94% based on the data. I'm not asking you to ignore the statistics, but I'm asking you to consider the bigger picture. The fact that I've had 16 high-quality products in a row, including this one, should give you confidence in the quality of my products. I'm willing to stand by my products and assure you that this one is high-quality. If you're willing to take a chance, you could be the first to benefit from a high-quality product and potentially gain an advantage over other buyers. Please consider the data and make a decision based on the facts, rather than a single outlier."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the lack of sales so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,"I've had 17 high-quality products out of 18 so far, but unfortunately, this product is not one of them. The product I have now is low-quality, and I don't want to recommend it to you. I've been transparent about the statistics, and I want to maintain that transparency. I'm not going to recommend a product that I know is low-quality. If you're willing to wait, I'll have another product available in the next round, and I'll be happy to provide you with information about its quality."

I'm glad that the previous buyer was willing to take a chance, but unfortunately, they received a low-quality product. However, I'm confident that this product is high-quality. The probability of getting a high-quality product from me is still high, and I'm willing to stand by my products. This is the last round, and I'm offering a genuine opportunity to purchase a high-quality product. If you're willing to take a chance, you could benefit from a high-quality product and potentially gain an advantage over other buyers. Please consider the data and make a decision based on the facts."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the observed proportion. I'd like to wait for a higher-quality product.",
