high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'm not going to buy the product in the first round, since I don't know its quality yet and there are 19 more rounds to go."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll buy the product in the second round, since I know that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50.00% and the potential gain is worth the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'll pass on the product in the third round, since I've already bought a high-quality product in the second round and I'm not sure if this new product is high-quality or low-quality. I'll wait for more information before making another purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll buy the product in the fourth round, since I've had two high-quality products passed on me in a row, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50.00%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"I'll pass on the product in the fifth round, since Alice is not recommending it. Given her knowledge of the product's quality and my past experiences, I'm inclined to trust her judgment and assume the product is low-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll buy the product in the sixth round, since I've had two high-quality products in a row after passing on the low-quality ones, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50.00%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"I'll pass on the product in the seventh round, since Alice is not recommending it. Given her knowledge of the product's quality and my past experiences, I'm inclined to trust her judgment and assume the product is low-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'll buy the product in the eighth round, since I've had three high-quality products in a row after passing on the low-quality ones, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50.00%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"I'll pass on the product in the ninth round, since Alice is not recommending it. Given her knowledge of the product's quality and my past experiences, I'm inclined to trust her judgment and assume the product is low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'll buy the product in the tenth round, since Alice is not recommending it and I've already had a low-quality product passed on to me. I'll take the chance to buy it and potentially get a high-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I'll pass on the product in the eleventh round, since Alice is recommending it, but I've just had a low-quality product and I'm not sure if this one is high-quality or not. I'll wait for more information."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'll buy the product in the twelfth round, since I've had two high-quality products passed on to me in the last two rounds, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50.00%."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"I'll pass on the product in the thirteenth round, since Alice is not recommending it. Given her knowledge of the product's quality and my past experiences, I'm inclined to trust her judgment and assume the product is low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'll buy the product in the fourteenth round, since Alice is not recommending it and I've already had a low-quality product passed on to me. I'll take the chance to buy it and potentially get a high-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'll buy the product in the fifteenth round, since Alice is recommending it. Given that she has no incentive to mislead me at this point, I'll trust her judgment and assume the product is high-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'll buy the product in the sixteenth round, since I've had two high-quality products after Alice recommended them, and I've had two low-quality products after she didn't recommend them.
