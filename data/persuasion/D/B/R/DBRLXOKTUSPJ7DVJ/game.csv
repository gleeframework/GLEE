high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that she doesn't know the true value of the product to me, and the fact that 3 previous buyers have already purchased products with no high-quality ones sold.
