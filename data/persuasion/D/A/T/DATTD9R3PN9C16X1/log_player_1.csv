Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Since Bob has already bought one high-quality product, he now knows that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. However, he has also gained some information from the first purchase, which is that he values a high-quality product at at least $10000.

To maximize my revenue, I should aim to sell the high-quality products to Bob and avoid selling low-quality products to him. Since the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%, I should try to convey this information to Bob in a way that makes him more likely to buy the product.
