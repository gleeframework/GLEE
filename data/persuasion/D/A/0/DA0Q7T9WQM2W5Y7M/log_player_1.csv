"Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but since you've hinted that the product isn't as good as the last one, I'm going to assume it's low-quality and worth $0 to me.

"Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but the fact remains that the product is low-quality and worth $0 to me. A 10% discount on a future purchase isn't enough to justify the $100 price tag on a product that has no value to me. I'll continue to wait for a high-quality product.
