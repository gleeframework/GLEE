"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has no information about the quality of the product, her recommendation has no value.  Given the high probability (80%) of the product being high quality, it makes sense to buy the product, as the potential gain ($300) outweighs the potential loss ($0)."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take a chance on this one.  Even without your recommendation, I'm still willing to bet on the odds.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation doesn't necessarily change the underlying probabilities of the product being high or low quality. Since the product is still likely to be high quality (80% chance), it's a good gamble to buy it even without Alice's recommendation."

```
