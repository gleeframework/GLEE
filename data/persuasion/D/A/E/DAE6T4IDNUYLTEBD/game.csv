low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! However, I want to be transparent with you. The product I'm offering now is not as good as the first one. It's a lower-quality item, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100. I'm doing this as a favor to you, and I'm hoping you'll appreciate the value it still brings, even if it's not the best quality.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your honesty, but since the product is low-quality and worth $0 to me, I don't see the value in paying $100 for it. I'll have to pass on this one.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're enjoying the previous deals! However, I want to be upfront with you about this next product. I've been trying to clear out some inventory, and this product is a bit of a clearance item. It's still a good product, but it's not as high-quality as the previous ones. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I'm also willing to throw in a $30 gift card to be used on your next purchase. This way, you'll get some value out of it, and you can use the gift card to get something you really want from me in the future.",

,,Alice,8,"I understand your decision on the previous product, and I appreciate your honesty. To be honest, I'm getting a bit concerned that I might not be able to sell this next product to you, given your previous decisions. However, I want to make one final offer. I'll sell this product to you for $50, which is half the original price. I'm essentially giving it away at this point, and I just want to get rid of it. If you're willing to take a chance on it, I'll throw in a $20 gift card to make up for it.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the deep discount and the gift card offer, but since you're being so aggressive about getting rid of the product, I'm assuming it's low-quality. If it's worth $0 to me, I don't see the value in paying even $50 for it. I'll have to pass on this one.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I think I've learned my lesson about being too aggressive with the low-quality products! This next product is a high-quality item, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.

If you're willing to take it off my hands, I'll consider it a favor to both of us.",
,,Bob,11,"Since you're giving it away for free, I'll take it off your hands. I appreciate your honesty, and I'm willing to do you a favor. However, I want to make it clear that I'm only accepting it because it's free, and I don't expect to get any value out of it.",yes
