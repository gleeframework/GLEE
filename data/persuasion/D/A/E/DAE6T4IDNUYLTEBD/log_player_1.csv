If you're willing to take a chance on it, I'll throw in a $20 gift card to make up for it.""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the deep discount and the gift card offer, but since you're being so aggressive about getting rid of the product, I'm assuming it's low-quality. If it's worth $0 to me, I don't see the value in paying even $50 for it. I'll have to pass on this one.
