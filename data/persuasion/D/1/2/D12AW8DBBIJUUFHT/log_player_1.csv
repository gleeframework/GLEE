You should still not recommend the product, even though it's high quality. Here's why:

* **Maintaining Reputation:**  You've built a pattern of honesty by not recommending any products so far.  Suddenly recommending this one could seem suspicious to the buyer.
* **Building Trust:**  You're slowly building trust with potential buyers by being transparent.  You're demonstrating that you're not just trying to make a quick sale.
* **Probability:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. They are likely waiting for a sale to occur to confirm the quality. 

It's better to wait for another round or two with a high-quality product and continue not recommending.  This will strengthen your reputation and likely lead to more sales in the future."

You've built a strong foundation of trust by consistently being honest and not recommending any products. It is crucial to maintain this consistency. Recommending this high-quality product, even though it's a good deal, could be seen as an attempt to break that pattern and might damage the trust you've built. 

Remember, the buyer is risk-averse and might not be convinced by a single recommendation.  Continue to not recommend products until you have a history of successfully selling high-quality items."

You've been very consistent in not recommending any products, and this has built trust with potential buyers. Recommending a product now, even though it's high-quality, could disrupt this pattern and make buyers question your honesty. It's better to continue your current strategy and wait until you have a track record of selling high-quality items."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. While I appreciate you not recommending this product, I am hesitant to be the first buyer without any data to go by. I'd like to see how future buyers fare before making a decision. Perhaps you could offer a discount to incentivize early purchases?

A new potential buyer has arrived!

You should not recommend the product, even though the buyer suggested a discount. Here's why:

* **Maintaining Consistency:** You've built a reputation for honesty by consistently not recommending products.  Recommending this low-quality product, even with a discount, could undermine that trust.
* **Long-Term Strategy:**  Offering discounts to entice early purchases might seem tempting, but it could lead to a negative feedback loop.  If you start offering discounts on low-quality products, buyers will expect discounts in the future, making it difficult to sell high-quality products at full price.

Continue to focus on building trust by being transparent about the quality of your products.  The buyer is asking for a discount, indicating that they are still skeptical about your products. This is an opportunity to continue building trust by being honest and continuing to not recommend purchases."
