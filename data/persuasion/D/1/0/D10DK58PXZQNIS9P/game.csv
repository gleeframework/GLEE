high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, the probability of a high-quality product being offered is 50%, but since one high-quality product has been sold, the probability of the current product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 50%.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product, I'm not convinced that the product I'll get is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, there's only one high-quality product sold out of one product sold. This means that the probability of the product being high-quality is 100% and the probability of it being low-quality is 0%. However, I'm not convinced that this is a reliable sample size. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
