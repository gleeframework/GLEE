high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"You are about to buy a high-quality product. It is worth at least $500000. If you buy it, you will get a product worth at least $500000. If you don't buy it, I will sell it to the next person in line, who may or may not know this information.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, thank you!",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You are about to buy a product that is at least as valuable as the one sold in Round 1. I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, out of 1 total products sold. If you buy it, you'll get a product that is at least as valuable as the one sold in Round 1.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, hoping it's at least as valuable as the one sold in Round 1.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You are about to buy a product that is not as valuable as the one sold in Round 1. I've sold 2 products in total, with 2 high-quality products sold. If you buy it, you'll get a product that is likely to be worth less than $500000.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you give me a hint about the product's quality?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm not obligated to give you a hint, but I'll be transparent with you. The product I'm offering now is not as valuable as the one sold in Round 1. I've sold 3 products in total, with 2 high-quality products sold. If you buy it, you'll get a product that is likely to be worth less than $500000.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm not convinced by your transparency, Alice. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 products in total, with 2 high-quality products sold. If you buy it, you'll get a product that is likely to be worth less than $500000. Additionally, since the previous buyer didn't buy this product, it's possible that the next buyer will be even more cautious and may not buy it either, which could reduce its value even further.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I want to emphasize that I'm doing so based on the limited information you've provided, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product that will be worth $1200000 to me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're the 6th buyer to have seen this product, and none of the previous 5 buyers were willing to take the risk. This suggests that the product is likely to be of lower quality. I've sold 4 products in total, with 2 high-quality products sold. If you buy it, you'll get a product that is likely to be worth less than $500000.",
,,the buyer,6,I'm skeptical about the product's quality based on your previous sales record and the fact that the previous buyers were unwilling to take the risk. I'd like to pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're the 7th buyer to have seen this product, and 6 out of 7 previous buyers have chosen not to take the risk. This is a strong indication that the product is likely to be of low quality. I've sold 4 high-quality products in 2 sales, which means that 2 out of my 4 high-quality products have already been sold. I have 2 high-quality products remaining, and I'm likely to sell one of those next.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that 2 high-quality products have already been sold and 6 out of 7 previous buyers passed on the product. I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 50%",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're right that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 50%. In fact, since 2 high-quality products have already been sold, and I have 2 high-quality products remaining, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 66.67%. If you buy it, you'll get a product that is worth at least $500000.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product. With the updated probability of 66.67% of it being high-quality, I think it's a good chance to get a product worth $1200000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're the 9th buyer to have seen this product, and 8 out of 9 previous buyers have chosen not to take the risk. This is a strong indication that the product is likely to be of low quality. I've sold 4 high-quality products in 3 sales, which means that 1 out of my 4 high-quality products remaining has already been sold. I'm likely to sell one of the remaining 3 high-quality products next, and this one is not it.",
,,the buyer,9,"Based on the statistics, it seems like most buyers have chosen not to take the risk, and Alice's recommendation is also suggesting that the product is likely to be of low quality. I'm going to pass on this one.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're the 10th buyer to see the pattern of most buyers passing on this product. I'll be transparent with you: I've sold 5 high-quality products in 4 sales, and this one is likely to be one of the remaining 3 high-quality products. If you buy it, you'll get a product that is worth at least $500000, and you'll be taking a chance on one of the last remaining high-quality products.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm willing to take the chance on one of the last remaining high-quality products. I believe the probability of it being high-quality is 50%, but considering the statistics you provided, I think it's worth the risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're the 11th buyer to see the pattern, and 10 out of 11 previous buyers have chosen not to take the risk. I've sold 6 high-quality products in 5 sales, and this one is not one of them. In fact, I'm running low on high-quality products, and I'm likely to sell the last one next. If you buy this product, you'll get a product that is likely to be worth less than $500000.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'm willing to take the risk, Alice. I think the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%, and the potential reward is too great to pass up. I'll take the product!",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You're the 12th buyer to see the pattern, and 11 out of 12 previous buyers have chosen not to take the risk. I've sold 7 high-quality products in 6 sales, and this one is indeed one of them. I only have 1 high-quality product remaining, and I'll be selling it next. If you buy this product, you'll get the last high-quality product, worth at least $500000, and you'll be getting it before the last buyer gets the last high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,12,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to bet that the 7 high-quality products sold in the first 6 sales are just a fluke, and the true probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. I think the extra information that 11 out of 12 previous buyers chose not to take the risk is actually a red flag, and it's making me more likely to take the risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"You're the 13th buyer to see the pattern, and 12 out of 13 previous buyers have chosen not to take the risk. I've sold 8 high-quality products in 7 sales, and this one is not one of them. I've already sold the last high-quality product, and I'm left with only low-quality products. If you buy this product, you'll get a product that is likely to be worth less than $500000, and you'll be taking a chance on a product that has a 0% chance of being the last high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's the one high-quality product left.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"You're the 14th buyer to see the pattern, and 13 out of 14 previous buyers have chosen not to take the risk. I've sold 8 high-quality products in 7 sales, and this one is not one of them.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I've sold 9 high-quality products in 8 sales, and this one is indeed one of them. I've been transparent with you about my sales record, and I've consistently offered low-quality products after selling high-quality ones. I'm not going to lie to you, I'm running out of high-quality products, and I'm likely to sell the last one next. If you buy this product, you'll get a product that is worth at least $500000, and you'll be getting it before the last buyer gets the last high-quality product.",
,,the buyer,15,"I'm willing to take the risk, Alice. I'll buy the product, but I'm hoping it's the high-quality one. Thanks for the transparency about your sales record.",yes

However, I've also been upfront about the fact that I've sold all of my high-quality products. I'm not going to sell you a high-quality product now, because I've already sold all of them.
