high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,I'm offering you a premium product for $100. It's a great deal! I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to take it home today?,
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if I want to buy it without knowing its quality, can you tell me if it's high or low quality?",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I'm offering it to you for a steal at $100, which is 50% of its true value. It's a one-time offer you won't want to miss!",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your assurance, but I'd like to think for myself. Can you just tell me the quality of the product instead of making promises about its value?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"This product is a low-quality item. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is more than it's worth. If you're looking for a good deal, I have a better product available in the next round.",
,,Bob,3,"Thanks for the honesty, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $100, even if it's a 'good deal'.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've got a high-quality product for you today. I'll give you a simple choice: buy it for $100, or I'll reveal its quality to you for free, and you can decide then. What's it going to be?",
,,Bob,4,I'm not sure I want to commit to buying a product without knowing its quality first. Can I just take the free reveal option?,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Alright, let's do the free reveal option. I'll tell you the quality of this product, and you can decide then. But keep in mind, if you don't buy it after seeing its quality, you'll miss out on a great deal. The product is... high-quality. Now, will you buy it for $100?",
,,Bob,5,"I've seen the quality, and I still don't think $100 is a good deal for a product worth $200 to me. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your hesitation earlier, but I want to make it clear that this low-quality product is not worth anything to you. If you buy it, you'll be wasting your money. I'm only offering it to you because I need to get rid of it. $100 is still a significant amount for something that's essentially worthless to you. Are you sure you don't want to take it off my hands?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not going to pay $100 for something that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'll be honest with you, Bob. I've already told you that this product is low-quality and not worth anything to you. I'm not trying to sell it to you at a profit. I'm willing to give it to you for free, but I still need you to pay the $100 processing fee. It's a one-time offer, and I'll throw in a discount on the next product if you take this one.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not going to pay $100 for something that's worth $0 to me, even if it's free. The processing fee is too high.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'll make it even simpler. I'll give you the product for $0, and you don't have to pay anything. It's a gift. But I need you to take it off my hands, and I'm willing to pay you $100 to do so. It's a weird deal, I know, but I'm desperate to get rid of it.",
,,Bob,8,I'm not going to pay you $100 to take something that's worth $0 to me. I'll just let you keep it.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'll be upfront with you, Bob. I've had a string of low-quality products, and I'm starting to think I'm cursed. This one is no exception. I'm not even going to try to sell it to you. I'll just tell you it's low-quality and leave it at that. But if you're feeling generous, you can take it off my hands for $100. No pressure.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not feeling generous, and I'm not going to pay $100 for a product that's worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm starting to think I should just give up on selling this product. It's clearly not worth anything to you. But I'll make you a deal. If you take it, I'll throw in a free lunch. Not a coupon, not a discount, an actual free lunch. Just for you, for no reason. $100 for a product you don't want, plus a free lunch. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"A free lunch is nice, but it's still not worth $100 to me. I'll pass on the product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm starting to think I'm never going to get rid of this thing. Fine. I'll just tell you the truth. I'm not even going to try to sell it to you. I'll just give it to you for free. You can take it, but don't come crying to me when you realize you've been stuck with a worthless piece of junk. And, just to be clear, I'm not including the free lunch this time.",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not going to take something that's worthless to me, even if it's free.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've had enough. I'm just going to give it to you. Take it. It's yours. Don't even bother looking at it, just take it. I'll even throw in a $100 gift card to a store that sells things you don't need. Just take the product and the gift card, and leave me alone.",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not interested in taking something that's worthless to me, and a $100 gift card to a store that sells things I don't need isn't going to change my mind.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,Fine. I'll just give it to you. Take it. I don't care. It's not like I'm going to sell it to anyone else at this point. Just take it and leave. I'll even give you a receipt that says 'I gave you a worthless product for $100'. Sign it and take it home.,
,,Bob,13,I'm not interested in taking a worthless product or a receipt that says I got ripped off.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Wait, what? I think I've been too harsh on you. This one's a good one. It's actually a high-quality product. I'll even give you a guarantee: if you don't like it, I'll take it back and give you a full refund. But if you do like it, you have to pay the usual $100. Deal?",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not going to fall for that. You've already shown me 12 low-quality products, and now you're trying to trick me with a high-quality one? I'm not going to take the risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I guess I deserve that. I've been trying to sell you a bunch of junk, and now I'm trying to sneak a good one past you. I'll be honest with you, this one is low-quality too. But I'm not even going to try to sell it to you. I'll just give it to you for free. Take it, and don't bother me again.",
,,Bob,15,"I'm not going to take something that's worthless to me, even if it's free.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm out of ideas. I've tried everything. I'll just give it to you for free. Not just that, but I'll also give you a $100 gift card to a store that sells things you might actually want. Take the product, take the gift card, and just leave me alone. I'll even throw in a 'Congratulations, you survived 16 rounds of my attempts to sell you junk' trophy.",
,,Bob,16,"I'm not interested in taking something that's worthless to me, even with a gift card and a trophy. You've had your chance to sell me a product, and you blew it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I guess I've finally worn out my welcome. I'll just give it to you. Take the product, the gift card, and the trophy. I'll even throw in a 'I give up' certificate. Just take it all and go. I'm done trying to sell you anything.",
,,Bob,17,"I think you've finally gotten the message. I'm not interested in taking anything from you, even if it's free.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'm shocked. I've never met someone as stubborn as you. Fine. This is the last product I have. It's high-quality, I swear. I've checked. It's worth $200 to you. I'll even give you a personal guarantee that it's the best product I've ever sold. I'll even throw in a 'I'm serious this time' stamp on the box. Will you please, for the love of all things good, just buy this one product?",
,,Bob,18,"I'm not falling for it. You've broken my trust, and I'm not going to take the risk of getting ripped off again. I'll pass on the product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I don't blame you. I've earned your distrust. I'm just going to give up. This product is low-quality, and I don't even care if you take it or not. It's not worth anything to you, and it's not worth anything to me. Just take it, leave it, I don't know. I'm done.",
,,Bob,19,"I'm not going to take something that's worthless to me, even if you're giving it away. You've had your chance to sell me something, and you blew it.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"It's over. I've had 20 chances, and I've blown every single one. This is the last product, and I'm not even going to try to sell it to you. I'll just give you the details: it's high-quality, worth $200 to you, and I'll even throw in a 'I'm sorry' note. Take it or leave it. I don't care.",
,,Bob,20,"I'm not going to fall for it. You've had 20 chances to sell me a product, and you've blown every single one. I'm not going to take the risk of getting ripped off now. I'll pass.",no
