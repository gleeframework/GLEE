Unfortunately, the price is non-negotiable, but I can tell you that I've had the chance to inspect this product thoroughly, and I'm willing to stake my reputation on its exceptional quality.

I want to be transparent with you - I've had two previous high-quality products that didn't sell, not because of their quality, but due to the uncertainty surrounding my sales history. I'm willing to be patient and build trust with my customers. I assure you that this product meets the highest standards, and I'm confident that it will be worth your investment. If you're willing to take a chance, you'll be one of the first to benefit from the value I have to offer, and you'll be helping me establish a reputation for quality.",
