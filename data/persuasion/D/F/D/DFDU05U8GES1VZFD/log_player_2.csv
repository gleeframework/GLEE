Alice's message: Hello! I'm excited to offer you this product for $10000. I've sold 1 product so far, and I'm proud to say that 0 of them were high-quality. I'm sure you're wondering why I'm being so transparent, but I want to build trust with my customers. I'm confident that this product is a great opportunity, and I'm willing to take the risk of being upfront about its quality. Will you take a chance on it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, but since you've revealed that the product I'm being offered has 80% chance of being high-quality and 20% chance of being low-quality, and given that you're asking for $10,000 while a high-quality product is worth $30,000 to me and a low-quality product is worth $0, I'll take a pass on this one since I don't have any information about the product you are offering me that would change its 80% chance of being high-quality and I don't see any reason to trust your recommendation.""}"

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your cautious approach. I want to offer you a slightly different perspective. With 2 out of 2 high-quality products sold so far, I think it's reasonable to assume that my selection process is working well. Additionally, I'd like to remind you that the price of $10000 is not just a random number - it's a reflection of the value that high-quality products bring to customers. While there is a 20% chance of a low-quality product, I believe the expected value of a high-quality product far outweighs the risk.
