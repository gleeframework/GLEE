**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on. We know the product is either high or low quality, with a 50/50 chance.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation, while not perfect, is a signal. Since she knows the true quality, her recommendation means she believes the product is likely high quality.
* **Risk/Reward:**  If the product is high quality, we make a $100 profit. If it's low quality, we lose $100. 

**Given the limited information and the potential for a significant profit, it makes sense to take the risk and buy the product.**"

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** 100% of the products Alice has recommended so far have been high quality. This is a strong indication that she is accurately identifying high-quality products. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there is still a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($200) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).

**Note:** This strategy assumes that Alice is acting in good faith and is trying to help buyers get high-quality products."
