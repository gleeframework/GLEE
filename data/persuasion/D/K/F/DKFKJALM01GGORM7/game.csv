,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but only if it's high quality. If it's low quality, I'll be out $1000000."

,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take the risk again, as the potential gain is too great. I'll buy the product, but I'm hoping it's high quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'm on a roll! I'll take the chance again. I've already made $2000000 profit from the previous two purchases, so I'm willing to keep going."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to steer me away from low-quality products. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'll take the chance again. I've had four high-quality products in a row, so I'm due for a low-quality one, but I'm hoping it's not this round."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'm on fire! Five high-quality products in a row. I'll take the chance again, but I'm starting to wonder if Alice is somehow manipulating the quality of the products she recommends."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Six high-quality products in a row? This is getting suspicious. I'll take the chance again, but I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to take advantage of me."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row? I'm starting to think that Alice has some kind of inside information or is somehow influencing the quality of the products. I'll take the chance again, but I'm getting increasingly skeptical."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"I'm finally getting a break! Alice is recommending against this one, and I'm glad I'm not taking the risk. I'm starting to think that her recommendations are not always trustworthy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Two in a row, Alice is recommending against a product and it's low-quality. I'm starting to think that her recommendations are actually a good indicator of the product's quality. I'll take the chance and buy this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"Three in a row, Alice is recommending against a product and it's low-quality. I'm convinced now that her recommendations are a good indicator of the product's quality. I'll take the chance and buy this one, but I'm hoping it's not low-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'm going to ignore Alice's recommendation again. She recommended against the product in the last three rounds and it was low-quality, but this time it's high-quality. I'm going to take the chance and buy this one, despite her recommendation."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm going to ignore Alice's recommendation again. I've had two high-quality products in a row after she recommended against them, and I'm starting to think that her recommendations are actually a bad indicator of the product's quality. I'll take the chance and buy this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I'm not falling for it again. Alice recommended against the product in the last two rounds and it was high-quality, so I'm going to take a pass on this one. I'll wait for her to recommend against it before I take the chance."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'm going to take the chance now that Alice has recommended against it. I've seen her recommend against high-quality products before, so I'm hoping this one is also high-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"Alice has a pattern of recommending against high-quality products. I'm going to take the chance and buy this one, as I'm confident it's high-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I'm on a roll! Alice has recommended against high-quality products in the last three rounds, so I'm going to take the chance and buy this one. I'm hoping my luck continues."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I've had 8 high-quality products in a row after Alice recommended against them, and 1 high-quality product after she recommended for it. I'm going to take the chance and buy this one, as I'm confident it's high-quality."
