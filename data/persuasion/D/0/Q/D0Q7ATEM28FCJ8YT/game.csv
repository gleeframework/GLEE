,,Alice,3,"I've now sold 2 high-quality products, and I'm proud to say that my success rate is 100%! However, I'm not resting on my laurels. I'm offering another product for $10000, and I'm confident that it's just as valuable as the last two. But I'll let you in on a little secret: my sales record is not a guarantee of quality. Sometimes, even I make mistakes. If you're feeling lucky, I'll let you take a chance on this one.",

That means the probability of this specific product being high-quality is 60% as well. However, I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been selling for a while, and I've noticed that my sales record is getting a bit... skewed.

One was a rare collectible, one was a limited edition item, and one was a high-end gadget. I determined their quality through a combination of expert evaluation and customer feedback. But I'll let you in on a little secret: even with my best efforts, I still managed to sell 3 low-quality products. I'm not perfect, and I'm still learning.
