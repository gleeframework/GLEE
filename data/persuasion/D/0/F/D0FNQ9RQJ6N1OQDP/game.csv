low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, and I'd like to start the sales record for Alice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, and I'd like to see the product's quality for myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that she doesn't know the true value of the product to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you've recommended against it, and none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that you've recommended 3 other buyers to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low, so I'll pass."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the current statistics, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think it's more likely to be low quality given Alice's previous recommendations and the lack of high-quality products sold. I'm willing to take the risk of it being high quality, but I'm hoping for a low-quality product to minimize my loss."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have received low-quality products, and Alice recommends buying, it's likely that the previous buyers were all low-quality products. If that's the case, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products Alice has available may be of low quality.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, which suggests that the products sold so far are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would mean it's more likely that the next product will be high-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not buying this product based on your previous recommendations and the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased a high-quality product. I'm inclined to think that the products being offered are mostly low-quality.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 5 previous buyers also didn't find it valuable enough to buy, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be of low quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'd rather pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of the fact that all previous buyers passed on the products after your recommendations, but I'd like to see the product's quality for myself."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be a low-quality product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Is it significantly lower than the expected 33.33%?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0 out of 6, which is consistent with the 33.33% probability of a product being high quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
