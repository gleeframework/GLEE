,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the fact that you've recommended not to buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet, suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to pass on this product.
