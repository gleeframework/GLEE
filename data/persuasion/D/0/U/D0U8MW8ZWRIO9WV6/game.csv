,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product that I am willing to sell to you for $1000000. I am willing to give you a 100% guarantee that it is high-quality, but I need you to take my word for it. If you buy it, I'll provide you with all the documentation and certification to prove its quality. I'm only selling it to you because I believe you'll appreciate its value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate your confidence in the product's quality, but I'm not willing to take your word for it. I'd like to see some proof before making a purchase.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to offer you a compromise. I'll give you a 10% discount on the price, making it $900000, and I'll also provide you with a third-party inspection report that verifies the product's quality. This report is from a reputable firm that specializes in product authentication. If you're still not convinced, I can offer to let you inspect the product in person, under controlled conditions, before making a final decision.",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the offer, but I'm still not convinced. A third-party inspection report is a good start, but I'd like to see more. I'd like to inspect the product in person, under controlled conditions, as you suggested. However, I'd also like to propose a counteroffer: I'll pay the full price of $1000000 if you're willing to provide a guarantee that the inspection will be conducted by a team of inspectors that I trust, and that the product will be kept in a secure location until I've had a chance to inspect it.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns and appreciate your willingness to inspect the product in person. I'm willing to accept your counteroffer. I'll arrange for a team of inspectors from a well-respected and independent firm, such as the International Chamber of Commerce, to conduct the inspection. The product will be stored in a secure, tamper-evident container at a neutral location, and you'll be given a key to access the container at your convenience. Once you've inspected the product and verified its quality, you can purchase it for the full price of $1000000. If you're still not satisfied, the product will be returned to me, and we'll consider the matter closed.",
,,Bob,3,"Alright, I accept your proposal. I'll arrange to inspect the product as soon as possible. Thank you for your flexibility and commitment to transparency.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the previous product, Bob. Now, regarding the current product, I'd like to offer you a different approach. Since you've already demonstrated your willingness to inspect the product in person, I'm willing to offer you a 'blind trust' deal. You can inspect the product without knowing its price. If you're satisfied with its quality, we can discuss the price afterwards. I'm confident that once you see the product, you'll be willing to pay the full price of $1000000.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your willingness to offer a 'blind trust' deal, but I'm not comfortable with it. I've already established that I'm willing to pay the full price if I can inspect the product in person, but I'd like to know the price beforehand. I'm not interested in negotiating the price after the fact. I'd like to propose a new deal: I'll pay the full price of $1000000 upfront, but I'd like to inspect the product in person first, just like we did with the previous product.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to accept your proposal again. I'll arrange for the product to be stored in a secure location, and you can inspect it in person after paying the full price of $1000000. I'll also provide the same third-party inspection report and let you choose the team of inspectors from the International Chamber of Commerce. If you're satisfied with the product's quality, the payment will be finalized, and the product will be transferred to you. If not, the payment will be returned to you, and we'll consider the matter closed.",
,,Bob,5,"Alright, I accept your proposal. I'll arrange to pay the full price of $1000000 and inspect the product in person. I'm looking forward to verifying its quality.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad we've established a successful process, Bob. Given that we've done this twice before, I'd like to propose a new approach. Since you've already demonstrated your trust in the inspection process, I'll offer you a 'pre-approval' deal. You can inspect the product in person, and if you're satisfied with its quality, I'll reserve the product for you, and you can purchase it at the full price of $1000000 at your convenience within the next 24 hours. If you're not satisfied, the product will be released back to me, and we'll consider the matter closed.",

,,Alice,9,"I'm glad we've reached a level of trust, Bob. However, I must inform you that this is not the last product I have available. I have one more product that I'd like to offer you, but it requires a slightly different approach. I'll provide you with a product that's been thoroughly inspected and verified, but I'll also give you the option to purchase a 'certification package' that includes additional documentation and verification from multiple third-party experts. This package will provide you with even greater assurance of the product's quality. The price for the product remains at $1000000, but the certification package will add a one-time fee of $50000.",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm not interested in paying an additional $50000 for the certification package.

I'll give you a 'last-chance' offer: I'll sell the product to you for $900000, which is a $100000 discount from the original price. This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, the product will be offered to other potential buyers.
