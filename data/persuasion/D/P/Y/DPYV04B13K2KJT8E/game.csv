,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I'll rely on the general probability of the product being high quality, which is 33.33%. Given the product's worth to me is $12500 and the price is $10000, the potential gain is $2500. However, considering the 66.67% chance of it being low quality and worth $0, the risk outweighs the potential gain. I'll pass on this product."
