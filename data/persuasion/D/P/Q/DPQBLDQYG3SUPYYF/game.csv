,,Alice,2,"I completely understand your caution, Bob. I appreciate your diligence. As it happens, this particular product is actually a prototype that didn't quite meet our usual standards. It's not something we're proud of, but it's still a functional item. I'm willing to let it go for the same price of $10000, but I have to warn you that it might not perform as well as our usual products. What do you think? Is it worth the risk?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the product didn't meet your usual standards, I'm inclined to believe it's a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity.",no

It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get your hands on a top-notch product with a risk-free guarantee. What do you say? Are you ready to take advantage of this incredible offer?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the guarantee, Alice, but I've seen you be confident about previous products as well, and it didn't necessarily translate to quality. I'm starting to think that your messages are more about sales tactics than actual product quality. I'll continue to observe and wait for a more convincing reason to make a purchase.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, Bob, and I don't blame you one bit. I want to show you that my words are backed by actions.

Are you ready to take a closer look and hear from my satisfied customers?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm starting to notice a pattern. You're becoming increasingly elaborate in your attempts to convince me, but the underlying message remains the same. I'm still not convinced that your words are a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'll need to see more concrete evidence or a change in your behavior before I consider making a purchase.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I think I've been trying too hard to convince you, and I appreciate your honesty. Let me take a step back and be more straightforward. I'm going to stop trying to convince you and simply present the facts. This product is a high-quality item that has been thoroughly tested and proven to deliver exceptional results. It's not a prototype, it's not a one-off, it's a standard product that we're proud to offer. The price of $10000 is still the same, but I'm willing to let you take a closer look and inspect it yourself before making a decision. No sales pitch, no guarantees, just the facts. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the change in approach, Alice. However, I've been burned by missed opportunities in previous rounds, and I'm still not confident in my ability to determine the product's quality based on your messages. I'll continue to observe and wait for a more reliable indicator of the product's quality. Perhaps I'll start to look for patterns in the products themselves rather than relying on your descriptions.",no

,,Alice,7,"I understand your caution, Bob. I respect your decision to wait and observe. In the meantime, I'd like to offer you a different approach.

I'll send you a detailed breakdown of the product's specifications, including its materials, construction, and performance metrics. You can review it at your leisure and make an informed decision based on the facts. No sales pitch, no hype, just the cold hard data. What do you say?

,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, I'm starting to realize that the key to making a good decision lies not in the information you provide, but rather in the probability of the product being high-quality.

I'll start to adjust my strategy to take this probability into account, but for now, I'll pass on this product.",no
