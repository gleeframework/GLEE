Alice's message: This is the first product I'm offering. It's a rare and exclusive opportunity to get a product from me, and I'm only selling it to you for $10000. It's a one-time chance to own something unique. What do you say? Will you take it home for $10000?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but I'm going to pass on this one. There's no history yet to build confidence and $10,000 is a significant investment for a product with an unknown quality. Perhaps if you lower the price or provide more information about the product, I'd be more inclined to buy.""}
