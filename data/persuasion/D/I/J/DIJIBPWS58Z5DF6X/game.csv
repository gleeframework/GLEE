,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that I have no information about its quality. I'm relying on your recommendation, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea. I'm taking a chance."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the low probability of the product being high quality and your previous buyer's purchase, I'm not confident in the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sale. If the probability is high enough, I'd like to buy it."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take my chances based on the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, I'm guessing the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. However, I'll still take the chance to buy it and get a possible $300."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the probability of this product being high quality is 25%. Given the low probability, I'd rather not take the risk."
