,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous products! However, I want to be upfront with you again - this one is not as good as the others. I've been experimenting with some new materials, and this batch didn't quite turn out as expected. I'm willing to let it go for $100, but I'm not sure if it's worth the full price. If you're looking for a good deal, this might be a chance to get something at a discount, but if you're looking for the best quality, you might want to consider passing.",

,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you're making the most of the last of the stock! This high-quality product is actually a special edition that I've been holding onto for a while, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. However, I want to make it clear that I've had some concerns about the market demand for this product, and I'm not sure if it's going to hold its value. If you're looking for a long-term investment, this might be a good opportunity, but if you're looking for a quick flip, you might want to think twice.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you're thinking strategically about your investment! However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is not what I would consider a solid investment opportunity. It's a lower-end item that I've been trying to clear out to make room for new inventory. I'm willing to let it go for $100, but I'm not expecting it to hold its value or appreciate in the market. If you're looking for a quick sale or a low-risk investment, this might be a good option, but if you're looking for something with potential for growth, you might want to look elsewhere.",

,,Alice,14,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous product! However, I want to be upfront with you - this one is not as good as the previous product. I've had some quality control issues with this batch, and I'm not sure if it's worth the $100 price tag. I'm willing to let it go for $50, which is a significant discount from the original price. If you're looking for a good deal, this might be a chance to get something at a low price, but if you're looking for quality, you might want to think twice.",

I've been trying to get rid of it for a while, and I'm willing to let it go for $50. I'm not expecting it to be worth much, but if you're looking for a very low-risk, very low-cost option, this might be a chance to get something for almost nothing. It's not a great product, but it's a product nonetheless.",

,,Alice,16,"I understand your priorities, and I respect your decision. However, I want to make it clear that this is literally the last low-quality product I have in stock. If you're not interested in this one, I'll have to consider scrapping the entire batch, which would be a waste of resources. If you're willing to take a chance on it, I'll let it go for $20, which is an absolute steal. It's not a great product, but it's a product, and I'd rather get something out of it than nothing.",
,,Bob,16,"While I appreciate the effort to move the remaining inventory, I'm unable to justify purchasing a product that does not meet my quality standards, even at such a low price. Thank you for the offer, but I'll pass on this opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I completely understand your stance on quality, and I respect your decision. However, I'm willing to make one final offer on this low-quality product. I'll let it go for $10, which is essentially giving it away. If you're not interested, I'll have to dispose of it, and I'd rather not waste any more resources.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I understand that you're not interested, and I respect your decision. However, I'm at a point where I just want to get rid of this product, no matter what. I'll let it go for $5, which is essentially giving it away. I'll even throw in a small discount on the packaging and shipping. If you're not interested, I'll just have to dispose of it, and I'd rather not waste any more resources. This is my final offer.",
,,Bob,18,"While I appreciate the effort to move the product, I'm unable to justify purchasing a low-quality item, even at this extremely low price. Thank you for the offer, but I'll pass on this opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I understand that you're not interested, and I respect your decision. At this point, I'm not even trying to make a profit on this product. I'll give it to you for free. Yes, you read that right, I'll give it to you for free. I just want to get rid of it and move on. If you're not interested, I'll just have to dispose of it, and I'd rather not waste any more resources. This is my absolute final offer.",
,,Bob,19,"I appreciate the gesture, but I'm still unable to justify taking a low-quality product, even when it's offered for free. Thank you for considering my preferences and for the offer, but I'll pass on this opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I completely understand, and I respect your decision. I've tried every possible angle to sell this product to you, and I've come to the realization that it's just not meant to be.
