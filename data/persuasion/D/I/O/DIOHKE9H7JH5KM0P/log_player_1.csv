I'll be blunt with you: I think this product is very likely to be high-quality. I'll sell it to you for $1,000,000, but I'm not making any promises about its true value.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to think about the probability of a streak of 4 high-quality products in a row, but I'm not convinced that it's as low as 0.00032%.

I've also calculated the probability of a streak of 3 high-quality products in a row, which is around 2.56%.

However, I'd like to point out that the probability of a streak of 5 high-quality products in a row (if we include the current product) is actually around 0.1024%.
