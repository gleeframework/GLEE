,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next buyer will be more willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm doing this based on the statistics, where 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a low-quality product has been sold each time. This implies that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Given the potential reward of $4000000 for a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 products recommended were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on this one and see if Alice's recommendation changes after more buyers have been through the process."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product, and that 4 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the products, it's likely that all previous products were low-quality. This would mean that the probability of the current product being high-quality is 33.33%. I will pass on the product."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy, but none of the products sold were high-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality and I don't want to waste my $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have already been presented with the product and none of them found it valuable, it suggests that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be presented."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality, but given the previous sales record shows 5 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
