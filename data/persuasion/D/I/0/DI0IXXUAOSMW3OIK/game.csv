,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you don't have information about my valuation and you're trying to sell the worst product to me."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure about the product's quality, and given the statistics, it's likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on it."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, I'm skeptical that this one will be any different. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have bought a high-quality product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. This means that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk based on the statistics that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality.

,,Alice,15,yes,

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would make it a good buy for me."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the 7th buyer and the previous 6 buyers all passed on the product. I'm hoping that the low sales rate of high-quality products might be a coincidence and that this one might be high-quality."
