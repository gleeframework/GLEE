,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer's experience? What was the quality of the product they purchased?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, it's too early to make any conclusions about the overall quality of the products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not sure if the previous buyer was just lucky or if there's a pattern, but I'd like to wait and see if the next buyer gets a high-quality product. Can I get the next product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount. I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy it, which might indicate that it's a low-quality product."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the products after your recommendations, I'm inclined to think that your recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend me to buy the product and the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'd rather pass on it to avoid wasting my money."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products. I think the probability of a high-quality product being recommended is lower than 50%, so I'd rather pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,

,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low-quality. I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both products were low quality, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendation is not reliable. I'll pass on this product and wait for the next one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this product.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products sold were low-quality. I'm going to assume that the products sold so far are representative of the overall distribution, which suggests a 0% chance of a high-quality product being sold. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the previous two buyers were unlucky and the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
