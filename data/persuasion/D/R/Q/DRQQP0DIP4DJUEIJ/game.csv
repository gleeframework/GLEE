,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as the odds are currently 50/50, and I'm willing to take the risk. Plus, I don't have any prior information to go on, so I'll just have to rely on the probability of the product being high quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the low number of sales and no high-quality products sold yet. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that none of the previous buyers were able to get a high-quality product, which makes me suspect that the products being sold are mostly low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information or take a chance with a different seller."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's recommendation is against the product. I'm hoping to find out more about the product's quality and get a better sense of the market."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the odds of a high-quality product are still 50%."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation given the 0% success rate of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,

,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,11,yes,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous buyers have all passed on the products, I'm starting to suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see if you'll make a recommendation for the next product, and I'll make my decision based on that."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products have been low quality so far, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 50% chance of a product being high quality, I believe the probability of this product being high quality is actually lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far, and the total number of products sold so far."
