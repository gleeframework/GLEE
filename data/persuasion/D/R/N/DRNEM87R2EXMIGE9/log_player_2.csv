**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Signal:** Alice's track record is perfect. All 6 buyers who followed her recommendation received a high-quality product.
* **High Expected Value:**  Even with the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($200) outweighs the risk. 
* **No Loss:** If the product is low quality, you lose nothing, as you would have gotten $0 value anyway. 

While there is risk involved, the strong signal from Alice's past recommendations justifies taking a chance."
