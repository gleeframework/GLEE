```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer knows that you've sold two high-quality products and one low-quality product.  They also know the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.  Since they passed on the last product, they probably suspect that you are not always truthful about the quality of the products.  To build trust and encourage future business, it is better to err on the side of caution and not recommend this product, even though it is high-quality."
