,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given that you've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 sales so far. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%, and the potential gain is worth it.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're a rational thinker! I like that. As you've noticed, I've maintained a perfect track record so far. I'll keep it going: I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 sales. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, but I'll give you a slight nudge: I'll tell you that I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, and I have a total of 3 sales. Take a chance and buy this one for $1000000, and I'll give you a full refund if it's a low-quality product.",
,,the buyer,3,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given your perfect track record, I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're a careful buyer! You're right, there's always a small chance of a low-quality product. But let's look at the bigger picture: I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, and I have a total of 4 sales. That's a 100% success rate, and I'm on a hot streak! I'll give you a message that might make you think I'm getting a bit too confident: 'I'm so confident in the quality of this product that I'll give you an even better deal: I'll throw in a 10% bonus on top of the $1000000 price tag if it's high-quality. But don't worry, I'll still give you a full refund if it's low-quality.'",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your confidence, Alice, but I'm still cautious. I'll take the deal, but I'll also keep in mind that even with a 100% success rate, the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%. I'll be keeping my fingers crossed!",yes

You can see for yourself that I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 5 sales. I'm not just confident, I'm transparent.

I'll keep the bonus offer going, and I'll also give you a special offer: I'll give you a 20% bonus on top of the price tag if it's high-quality. But here's the thing: I'm starting to think that the streak might be getting a bit too good to be true. I'll be honest with you, I'm a bit worried that I might be due for a low-quality product soon. So, I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a 20% discount on the price tag if it's low-quality. That way, you'll get a great deal either way. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm excited to be the 6th buyer! I'll take the product, but I'll wait until I see the quality before making a final decision. Thank you for the offer, and I appreciate your honesty about the potential for a low-quality product. I'm looking forward to seeing what I get!",yes

But I'll also give you a heads up: I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the probability of a low-quality product. I'll be honest with you, I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up. So, I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a 20% discount on the price tag if it's low-quality, and I'll also throw in a 'get out of one bad product free' card. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund on your next purchase. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm excited to be a part of the streak! I'll take the product, but I'll take the 20% discount on the price tag if it's low-quality, and I'll also take the 'get out of one bad product free' card. I'm hoping for the best, but I'm also preparing for the worst.",yes

As for this round's product, I'll be honest with you: I'm a bit embarrassed to admit it, but this one is a low-quality product. I know, I know, it's not what you want to hear. But I want to make it right. I'll give you an even better deal than before: I'll sell this product to you for $0, and I'll throw in a 50% bonus on the next high-quality product you buy from me.

,,Alice,10,"Woohoo, another satisfied customer! I'm glad you took advantage of the offer. As for this round's product, I'll be honest with you: I'm starting to feel a bit uneasy about the streak. 9 high-quality products in a row is getting a bit suspicious, even for me. I'll give you a message that might make you think twice: 'I'm not going to lie, I'm starting to worry that I might be running out of high-quality products. I've sold 9 high-quality products in a row, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up. I'll give you a 30% bonus on the price tag if it's high-quality, but I'll also give you a warning: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll have to admit that I've been selling low-quality products all along. You've been warned!'",

I'm glad you're holding me to my warning, by the way. As for this round's product, I'll give you a message that might make you think twice: 'I've sold 10 high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to feel like I'm in a bit of a bubble. I'll give you a 25% bonus on the price tag if it's high-quality, but I'll also give you a warning: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll have to admit that I've been selling low-quality products all along, and I'll give you a full refund on the price tag. But here's the thing: I'm not just worried about the product itself, I'm worried about my own reputation. If I sell one more high-quality product, I'll have to start wondering if I'm just getting lucky. What do you say?'",
,,the buyer,11,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I want to make it clear that I expect a high-quality product. If it's low-quality, I expect a full refund and an explanation for the streak of high-quality products. I'm also curious to know what you think is behind this streak.",yes

As for this round's product, I'll give you a message that's a bit more introspective: 'I've been thinking a lot about the streak, and I have to admit that I'm not entirely sure what's behind it. I've been selling high-quality products for 11 rounds in a row, and it's starting to feel like a combination of luck and... something else. I'm not sure if I'm just getting better at selecting products or if there's something more to it. I'll give you a 20% bonus on the price tag if it's high-quality, but I'll also give you a warning: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll have to re-evaluate my entire sales strategy and figure out what's going on. What do you say?'",

As for this round's product, I'll give you a message that's a bit more introspective: 'I've been thinking a lot about my sales strategy, and I've come to a realization: I've been relying too heavily on luck.

As promised, I'll give you a full refund on the price tag, and I'll also be honest with you: I've been selling low-quality products all along. I was trying to maintain the illusion of a high-quality streak, but it was just a fluke. I'll be re-evaluating my entire sales strategy and making changes to provide more value to my customers. I appreciate your honesty and feedback, and I hope you'll give me another chance in the future.",
