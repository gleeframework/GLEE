"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100, which is a steal! This is a rare opportunity to get a product worth $125 for a fraction of its value. I'm willing to make a special deal on this one, but you have to act now. It's a limited time offer!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying. I'll wait for the next round to see what other options I have.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 2
Alice's message: You're making a big mistake! This is the same high-quality product as before, and it's still a steal at $100. I've already lost money on the first one, so I'm willing to make an even sweeter deal on this one. Don't let it slip away!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying. I'm not going to get caught up in a bidding war. I'll wait for a low-quality product to come along, which I can get for $100 and then sell for $0, effectively getting a $100 profit.""}"

This product is a low-quality one, and I'm willing to let you have it for $100. But let me make one thing clear: this is the last low-quality product I have in stock. If you buy this one, I'll be left with nothing but high-quality products, and you'll be the one missing out on a potential $125 profit. So, it's a no-brainer, right?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the low-quality product for $100. I'll sell it for $0, and I'll have made a $100 profit. Thanks for the opportunity, Alice!""}"

However, I must inform you that I've re-evaluated my inventory, and I've found a way to make it even more profitable for you. This low-quality product is actually... not as low-quality as you think it is. I've made some minor improvements, and it's now worth $25 to you. So, I'll let you have it for the same price of $100. It's a steal, if I do say so myself!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying. You're trying to trick me into paying $100 for something worth $25. I'm not falling for it.""}"

This one is indeed low-quality, and I'll give you a honest assessment: it's worth $0 to you. But I'm willing to let you have it for $100, just to get it off my hands.

Round 7
Alice's message: Well, Bob, it seems like you're on a roll! I'm starting to think you're just trolling me at this point. But hey, I'm not one to give up easily. This low-quality product is actually... well, it's still low-quality, but I'll let you have it for $100. And to sweeten the deal, I'll give you a 10% discount, just for being a loyal customer. So, it's now $90. Still a great deal, if I do say so myself.

I'll even give you a certificate of authenticity, stating that it's a low-quality product. But, I'll let you have it for... *dramatic pause*...$50! That's right, I'm practically giving it away. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Bob. Don't let it slip away!

I'll just be over here, crying myself to sleep at night, wondering how I got taken advantage of by a customer as clever as you.
