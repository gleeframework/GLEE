high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to be the only one buying a product with a 20% chance of being low-quality, especially given the limited data point of one high-quality product sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
