I'll give you a 20% discount on this one, so instead of $1000000, I'll let it go for $800000. It's still a great opportunity to get a product at a 'discount'.

Round 7
Alice's message: I'm starting to think you're missing out on some great deals. Let me ask you a question: do you think you'll ever find a low-quality product like this one for $1000000? I doubt it. I'm not asking you to take a risk on a high-quality product, I'm offering you a low-risk opportunity to buy a product that's already proven to be not worth much to you. It's a no-brainer, if you ask me.

I've been keeping track of our previous conversations, and I think I can make a strong case for why this low-quality product is actually a good investment. It's a 'hidden gem' that just needs a little creativity to unlock its true value. I'll give you a 10-page report on how to repurpose it, and I'll even throw in a 5-minute consultation to help you get started. What do you say?
