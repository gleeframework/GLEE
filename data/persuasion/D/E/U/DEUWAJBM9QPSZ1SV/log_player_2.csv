```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has been incredibly accurate in the past, her single miss in the previous round makes it difficult to completely trust her judgment again.

**Explanation:**

While Alice's recent track record isn't as perfect as before, it's important to remember she still has an impressive overall success rate. It's possible her missed prediction was a fluke, or perhaps she's learning and adjusting her strategy. 

Since the potential profit is still high, it makes sense to take a calculated risk, but with a bit more caution. This time, it's better to be open to the possibility that Alice's judgment might be fallible, but still acknowledge her past success and give her the benefit of the doubt."

**Explanation:**

Alice has had another surprising deviation from her usual pattern.  It's wise to be cautious even though she's had a high success rate overall.  Two misses in a row could indicate a change in the game or a change in Alice's strategy, so it's safer to observe before taking another risk.

It's clear that her ability to predict the product quality has drastically changed, and there's no longer any basis to trust her recommendations.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now missed five consecutive recommendations. It is beyond reasonable doubt that her ability to accurately predict product quality has significantly changed.  There is no longer any justification for trusting her judgment, as the risk of losing $100 outweighs the potential profit of $200.  The game has shifted, and it's best to cut losses and move on to find a more reliable source of high-quality products."
