,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and based on the fact that none of the previous buyers purchased the product, I'm going to take a cautious approach and wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on the recommendation. Given that 2 previous buyers also passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not sure I should buy based on your recommendation alone, can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products in your previous sales?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both were low-quality products, I'm inclined to think that Alice is recommending low-quality products. I'll wait for the next one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if all high-quality products have been sold already, the one you're recommending might be low quality as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
