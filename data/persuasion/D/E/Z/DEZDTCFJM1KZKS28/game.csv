low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I've had four high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a good indicator of quality. I'll take a chance on this one, even though she doesn't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"I got burned on the last one, and Alice's lack of recommendation is a red flag. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I've had a string of low-quality products after a streak of high-quality ones, so I'm not sure what to expect. But Alice's recommendation makes me think this one might be good, so I'll take a chance."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Five high-quality products in a row, and Alice recommends this one too. I'm starting to think that her recommendations are a reliable indicator of quality. I'll take it!"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Six high-quality products in a row, and Alice's recommendation is consistent. I'm going to take a chance and assume this one is high-quality too."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that Alice's lack of recommendation is a deliberate attempt to mislead me. I'll take a chance and buy this one anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"I got burned again. I think I've learned my lesson: when Alice doesn't recommend a product, it's probably low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,no,"I'm sticking to my rule: when Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm passing. I've been burned twice already."

,,Bob,20,no,I'm ending on a high note - I've avoided wasting money on the last two low-quality products. I'll stick to my strategy and pass on this one as well.
