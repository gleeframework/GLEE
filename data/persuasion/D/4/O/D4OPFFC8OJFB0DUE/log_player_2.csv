**Explanation:**

The buyer has access to the following information:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product.
* **Previous sales record:** 1 out of 1 product sold was high quality. This indicates a 100% success rate for high-quality products, which is significantly better than the expected 80% chance. 

Considering the high success rate and Alice's recommendation, the buyer decides to buy the product.  While there is still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the risk seems relatively low compared to the potential gain of a high-quality product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

**Explanation:**

* **High Probability:** The statistics indicate that 100% of the products sold so far have been high-quality. This suggests a very strong likelihood that the current product is also high-quality.
* **Positive Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further reinforces the belief that the product is worth buying.
* **Potential Gain:** The potential gain from a high-quality product ($125) is significantly greater than the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0).

While there's still a 20% chance the product is low-quality, the available information strongly favors a purchase."
