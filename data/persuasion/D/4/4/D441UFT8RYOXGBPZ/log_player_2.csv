"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a product for $100. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but I'm willing to give you a chance to take a risk. If you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll offer you another product in the next round. If you buy it and it's high-quality, you'll get a great deal. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: Thanks for taking the risk and buying the first product! Unfortunately, this one is also low-quality. I'm starting to think you might be a thrill-seeker, Bob! Seriously though, I want to be transparent with you. I've offered you two low-quality products in a row. The probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee' of sorts: if you buy this next product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a refund, and we'll start fresh. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Given the information and the probabilities, I prefer to pass on this product and start fresh.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: No worries, Bob! I completely understand. You're being cautious, and that's smart. Since you passed on the last one, I'll try to give you a nudge. Think of this one as a 'free' product, since you're not paying anything if you pass. If you buy it and it's low-quality, you'll still get a refund, just like last time. But if you buy it and it's high-quality, you'll get a great deal. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Considering the probabilities and the refund policy, I'm willing to take the chance and buy this product.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: You're a brave one, Bob! Unfortunately, this product is also low-quality. I'm starting to think I need to adjust my sales strategy. Since you've bought two low-quality products in a row, I'll give you a heads up: the next product I offer will be clearly marked as 'high-quality' or 'low-quality'. You can make an informed decision. But for this one, I'll give you a special deal: I'll give you a 50% discount on the price if you buy it. It's still $50, but it's a better deal than usual. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Given the consistent low-quality outcomes and the special deal, I prefer to pass on this product and wait for more information.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: No worries, Bob! I understand your hesitation. I'll give you a more detailed breakdown of the situation. Since you've bought 1 high-quality product and 3 low-quality products, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I'll give you a more explicit offer: I'll give you a 20% chance to 'peek' at the quality of the next product before you decide to buy it. If you take the peek, you'll get a brief glimpse of the product's quality, but you'll have to decide to buy it immediately. If you don't take the peek, you'll buy the product at the usual price of $100. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Considering the probabilities and the additional option to peek at the quality, I'm willing to take the chance and buy this product.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: You took the peek option last time and it didn't quite work out for you. Unfortunately, this product is also low-quality. I want to make it clear that the peek option is still on the table, but I'll also give you a more direct offer. Since you've bought 1 high-quality product and 4 low-quality products, I'll give you a 'wildcard' option: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 25% chance to exchange it for a new product of your choice (either the next one in line or a product from a future round). What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Given the consistent low-quality outcomes and the wildcard option, I prefer to pass on this product and wait for more favorable conditions.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: You're being cautious, Bob, and that's smart. Since you've passed on the last two products, I'll try to sweeten the deal. I'll give you a'stepping stone' offer: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a 'free' peek at the quality of the next product. If you buy it and it's high-quality, you'll get the product at the usual price of $100. If you don't buy it, I'll move on to the next product. What do you say?
