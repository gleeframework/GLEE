**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We have very little information. We know the product is either high-quality or low-quality with a 50/50 chance.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice wants to sell the product.  Even if it's low-quality, she's not losing money, but she is gaining $1,000,000 from the sale.
* **The First Buyer:**  The first buyer bought and got a high-quality product. This is a positive signal but not conclusive.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product is significant ($1,250,000).  The risk is the possibility of losing the $1,000,000.

**Conclusion:**  Given the limited information, taking a chance with a 50/50 chance of a significant reward is the most logical decision."
