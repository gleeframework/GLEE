However, since you have no information about the quality of the previous product, you should update the probability of the product being high quality based on the proportion of high-quality products sold. In this case, since 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. This suggests that the product is more likely to be low quality. Therefore, it's rational to pass on this product.""
