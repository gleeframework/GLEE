Alice's message: We've sold three high-quality products, which means we have 17 high-quality products left out of a total of 4 products sold. Given the high success rate, it's likely that this product is also high-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you - we've sold 3 out of 4 products so far, which is higher than the expected 80% probability. This could be due to chance, but it's also possible that we're experiencing a streak of high-quality products.

Alice's message: We've sold four high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely to be just a coincidence. This suggests that we may be experiencing a streak of high-quality products. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%.

Alice's message: We've sold five high-quality products in a row, and now we've sold a low-quality product. This is a stark contrast to the previous streak, and it's likely that the previous high-quality products were just a coincidence. I want to be upfront with you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and this low-quality product doesn't change that. However, I think it's worth considering that the previous streak might have been an anomaly, and we're back to the expected probability.

Alice's message: We've sold a low-quality product after a streak of high-quality products, and then another low-quality product. This suggests that the previous high-quality products might have been a fluke, and we're back to the expected probability.

Alice's message: I understand your caution, and I respect your decision to wait for more data. However, I want to point out that we've now sold 7 high-quality products out of 9 sold, which is a 78% success rate. This is getting closer to the expected 80% probability, but it's still a bit short. I'll offer you this product to you for $1000000, and I think it's worth considering that the probability of a high-quality product is likely closer to 80% than not. Plus, the law of large numbers suggests that the probability should converge to 80% as we sell more products.
