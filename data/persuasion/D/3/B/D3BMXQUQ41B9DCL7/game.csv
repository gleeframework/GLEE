high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, but since one high-quality product has already been sold, it's likely that the remaining products have a lower probability of being high-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
