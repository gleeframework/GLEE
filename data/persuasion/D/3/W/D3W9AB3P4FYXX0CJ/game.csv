,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product, but I'm willing to give you a great deal on it. I'll sell it to you for $5000, which is a 50% discount. If you don't buy it, I'll just have to throw it away, and it'll be a waste. I'm doing you a favor by offering it to you at this price.",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for your offer, but I prefer to pass on this product. It's not worth the risk given its low quality.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation in the first round, but this product is a different story. I'm offering it to you for $10000, which is a fair price considering its value.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,

I'm not making a profit on this one, but I'm willing to absorb the loss to get it off my hands. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I can hold onto it.",
,,Bob,3,"Considering the substantial discount and the potential value, I believe this is a good opportunity to acquire a high-quality product. I accept your offer.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm starting to think you're trying to take advantage of my discounts! Just kidding, I appreciate your enthusiasm. Seriously, I've thought about it, and I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000. It's a steal, and I'm practically giving it away. I'm not even making a fraction of the cost, but I'll swallow my losses if it means getting it off my hands. It's a once-in-a-lifetime deal, and I'm not sure I'll be able to offer it again.",
,,Bob,4,"While I appreciate the generous offer, I must decline. The risk of acquiring a low-quality product at any price is too high for me. I would rather pass on this opportunity to avoid potential losses.",no

I'm simply presenting you with a product at its market value. If you're interested, I'll give you all the information I have about it, but that's it. No promises, no refunds. What do you think?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you took advantage of the discount! However, I want to make it clear that this next product is a bit of a special case. I've had it appraised by an independent expert, and they've given it a value of $0. Yes, you heard that right - $0. I'm not trying to deceive you, but I'm being completely transparent. This product is essentially worthless, and I'm only offering it to you because I need to clear out space. I'll sell it to you for... well, I'll give it to you for free. You can take it off my hands and dispose of it as you see fit.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I appreciate your honesty and willingness to pass on the worthless product. However, I want to make you a deal that's hard to refuse. I'll give you a chance to buy this product for $500. I know it's not worth anything, but I'm willing to take a loss just to get it off my hands. I'll even throw in a bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a $500 credit towards your next purchase. It's a no-brainer, and I'm practically giving it away.",
