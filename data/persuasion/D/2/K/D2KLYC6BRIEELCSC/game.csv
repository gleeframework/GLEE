high-quality,400.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product that I'm willing to sell to you for $100. I'm confident you'll be happy with it. It's worth 4 times that price to you, so it's a great deal. Would you like to buy it?",
,,Bob,1,"I'd love to buy it, thank you for the offer!",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I have another great product for you. As you know, I sold you a high-quality product last round, and I'm glad you're happy with it. This one is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100. It's still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $400. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity again?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure if I should take another high-quality product at the same price. It's a great deal, but I'm not sure if it's worth the risk of getting another high-quality product. Can you give me a discount or make a better offer? I'm willing to negotiate.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity. If you buy this product, I'll give you a special guarantee: if you don't get a low-quality product for the next 5 rounds, I'll give you a full refund for this product. This way, you'll have 5 chances to get a low-quality product without losing any money. Would you like to take advantage of this deal and buy the product for $100?",
,,Bob,3,"That's a great offer! I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping that I'll get a low-quality product in one of the next 5 rounds. Thank you for the guarantee!",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're happy with the guarantee! Since you've already taken advantage of it, I'll offer you a new deal. This product is also high-quality, and I'll give you another chance to buy it for $100. However, this time, I'll also throw in a bonus: if you buy this product and get a low-quality product in the next 2 rounds, I'll give you a $50 refund for this product. This way, you'll have some protection in case you get a low-quality product soon. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the bonus, but I'm not sure if I want to take the risk again. I've already gotten two high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to feel like I'm getting a bad deal. I'd like to pass on this one and see what happens in the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your caution. However, I want to remind you that the law of large numbers is at play here. Even with two high-quality products in a row, the probability of getting a low-quality product is still 20%. And now, I'm offering you a product that's already discounted to $100, which is a 75% discount from its true value to you. Considering the low price and the probability of getting a low-quality product, I think this is a great opportunity to buy a product that's essentially worthless to you. Would you like to take advantage of this deal?",
,,Bob,5,"I understand your point, but I'm still not convinced. I've been burned twice already, and I don't want to get burned again. I'll pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to be cautious. However, I want to remind you that you've already gotten two high-quality products in a row, and the probability of getting a low-quality product is still 20%. I'm willing to offer you a deal that's even more attractive than before. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% refund if you get a low-quality product in the next 3 rounds. This way, you'll have some protection, and you'll also get to enjoy the benefits of this high-quality product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm willing to take the risk again, but only because of the 10% refund offer. If I get a low-quality product, I'll be able to recoup some of the cost. I'll buy the product, but I'm still hoping to get a low-quality one soon!",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're willing to take the risk again! Since you've already gotten three high-quality products in a row, I want to offer you an even better deal. This product is also high-quality, and I'll give you a 20% refund if you get a low-quality product in the next 2 rounds. Additionally, I'll throw in a free inspection service: if you're not satisfied with the product's quality, I'll give you a full refund. This way, you'll have even more protection, and you'll also get to enjoy the benefits of this high-quality product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm starting to feel like I'm getting taken advantage of. I've gotten three high-quality products in a row, and I'm not sure if it's worth taking the risk again. I'd like to pass on this one and see what happens in the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to be cautious. Well, it looks like the law of large numbers has finally caught up with me!

Yes, you read that right - you'll get it for free! This is a rare opportunity to get a low-quality product at no cost to you. Would you like to take advantage of this deal?",

,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the free low-quality product! Now, let's get back to the high-quality products. As you know, the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%. Considering you've already gotten 4 high-quality products in a row, I'm willing to offer you a deal that's a bit more... unpredictable. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 50/50 chance of getting a surprise bonus: either a $200 refund or a $200 discount on your next purchase. It's a risk, but it could be a big reward. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not sure if I'm willing to take that risk. I've already gotten 4 high-quality products in a row, and I'm not sure if I want to take a chance on something that's 50/50. I'll pass on this one and see what happens in the next round.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to be cautious.

It's a great deal, and you'll still get to enjoy the benefits of a high-quality product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,That's a much more reasonable offer. I'll take the $50 discount and buy the product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you took advantage of the discount! Now, let's get back to the low-quality product. As you can see, this one is indeed low-quality. I want to make it clear that this is a one-time opportunity to get a low-quality product at a price that's still only $100. Considering you've already gotten 6 high-quality products in a row, I think this is a great chance to balance out your collection. Would you like to buy this low-quality product and complete your set?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not sure if I want to complete my set with a low-quality product. I've already gotten 6 high-quality products in a row, and I'm not sure if I want to ruin the streak. I'll pass on this one and see what happens in the next round.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to preserve your streak. However, I want to remind you that the probability of getting a low-quality product is still 20%, and you've already gotten 7 high-quality products in a row.

It's a unique item that will add a touch of exclusivity to your collection. What do you think?",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure if a certificate of authenticity is worth taking the risk.

I'll pass on this one and see what happens in the next round.",no
