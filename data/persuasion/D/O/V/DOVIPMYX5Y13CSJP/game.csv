,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price today only. If you don't buy it now, the price will go up to $1500000 tomorrow.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me. I'd like to pass on this offer and see what the next product is.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I want to assure you that this is a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a discounted price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000, which is 20% below the market value of similar high-quality products. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else who's willing to pay the full price.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm still not convinced that it's worth $800000 to me. The product could be low quality, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your caution, but I want to offer you a unique opportunity to mitigate the risk. I'll give you a'satisfaction guarantee'. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $800000, and I'll also give you an additional $200000 as a gesture of goodwill. This way, you'll have nothing to lose, and you'll have the chance to acquire a high-quality product at a discounted price.",
,,Bob,3,"The satisfaction guarantee is a nice gesture, but it doesn't change the fact that I'm not sure the product is high-quality. I'd still be out $800000 if it turns out to be low-quality, and I'm not willing to take that risk.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to take on more of the risk. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $800000, but I'll also give you an additional 10% of the product's value as a bonus, which you can keep regardless of the product's quality. This way, you'll have a guaranteed minimum return of $880000, and you'll have the chance to acquire a high-quality product at a discounted price.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm willing to take the risk now. The guaranteed minimum return of $880000 is a significant incentive, and the potential upside of getting the product for $800000 is too good to pass up.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on making a great decision earlier! Now, I'd like to offer you a special deal on this next high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $1000000, but I'll also give you a 'priority access' to a future product that I'll be offering at a later round. This future product is expected to be even more valuable than the one you just bought, and you'll have the opportunity to buy it at a discounted price before anyone else. If you're interested in this offer, please let me know, and we can discuss the details of the future product.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying the current product for $1000000. I'm not sure what the 'priority access' to the future product entails, and I'd rather not commit to buying another product at full price when I'm not sure what's coming next.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your hesitation, and I'd like to clarify the 'priority access' offer. It means that if you buy this product, you'll get to see the details of the future product 2 rounds before anyone else, and you'll have the exclusive opportunity to buy it at a 10% discount. This way, you'll have a chance to make an informed decision about the future product and potentially save even more money. I'll also throw in a $200000 bonus if you buy this product and decide to buy the future product at the discounted price.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm still not convinced. The 'priority access' offer sounds like it's worth something, but I'm not sure if the future product will be worth buying at a 10% discount. I'd rather wait and see what the future product is before making a decision.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your caution, and I'm willing to make a more concrete offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $900000, and I'll also give you a'reservation right' to the future product. This means that if you decide to buy the future product, you'll get to buy it at the price I offer it to the general public, without any discount. If you don't buy the future product, the reservation right expires, and you'll have no further obligations. This way, you'll have the opportunity to buy a high-quality product now and keep your options open for the future product.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm willing to take the deal. The'reservation right' to the future product gives me a sense of security, and I'm willing to pay $900000 for the high-quality product now. I'll keep my options open for the future product and see what it's worth.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Great decision! Now, I'd like to offer you a special deal on this next high-quality product. Since you've already bought one product and reserved the right to buy the future product, I'll give you an exclusive 5% discount on this product. Normally, the price would be $1000000, but with the discount, it's $950000. I'll also throw in a $50000 bonus if you buy this product and decide to buy the future product at the price I offer it to the general public.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your decision, and I respect your caution. However, I'd like to remind you that the reservation right to the future product is a one-time opportunity, and you won't have it forever. If you don't buy this product now, the reservation right will expire, and you'll have to wait for the next round to see what the future product is. Considering the exclusive 5% discount I offered earlier, I think this is a good chance to get a high-quality product at a relatively low price. I'm willing to throw in an additional $30000 bonus if you buy this product now.",
,,Bob,9,I'm not convinced. The additional bonus you offered doesn't change my decision. I'd rather wait and see what the future product is before committing to buying another product.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your decision, but I want to remind you that the future product's price will be determined by the market, and it's possible that it may be more expensive than what you're willing to pay. With the reservation right expiring soon, I'm willing to make a one-time offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $850000, and I'll also give you a 'buy-back' option for the future product. If you decide you don't want the future product, you can sell it back to me at a guaranteed price of $1000000, no questions asked.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm willing to take the deal. The 'buy-back' option gives me a sense of security, and I'm willing to pay $850000 for the high-quality product. I'll keep my options open for the future product and have a way to get out of it if I don't want it.",yes

However, I'll make it even sweeter: if you buy this product, I'll give you the option to upgrade to a 'premium' version of the future product, which will be worth at least $1500000.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in buying the current product. The discount and bonus are nice, but I'm not sure if the premium version of the future product will be worth the upgrade. I'd rather wait and see what the future product is before committing to buying another product.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your caution, but I want to remind you that the premium version of the future product is a unique opportunity to get a significantly higher value. I'm willing to make a one-time offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $850000, and I'll also give you a 'premium guarantee'. If you decide to buy the future product, I'll automatically upgrade it to the premium version, and you'll get the higher value without having to pay extra. This way, you'll have a guaranteed minimum value of $1500000 for the future product, and you'll get a high-quality product now at a relatively low price.",

,,Bob,13,"I'm willing to take the deal. The 'double-or-nothing' guarantee is a high-risk, high-reward proposition, and I'm willing to pay $900000 for the high-quality product. If the future product is worth more than $2000000, I'll get a significant bonus, and if it's worth less, I'll get a refund. It's a gamble, but it's worth taking.",yes
