low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the current product, as the lack of sales history means there's no information to influence my decision. I'm essentially starting from a neutral position."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases so far.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you didn't recommend it, not because I have any information about the product's quality. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you don't know the true value of the product to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold, so I can make a more informed decision for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. Can you give me more information about the previous buyers and the products they purchased?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous 3 buyers also bought and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, I'll pass on the product. I'm curious to see if you have any information that would make you hesitant to sell it to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the previous three products were low-quality, and she's trying to avoid selling another low-quality product to me. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the pattern holds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that the products recommended to buy so far were likely low-quality, which makes me skeptical of Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm even more cautious. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is not very informative given the statistics. With 3 buyers having purchased and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm essentially taking a 50/50 chance, but I'm willing to take it because I'm the 4th buyer and I don't want to let the product go to waste."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the products?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you didn't recommend it, and given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if I can get a better idea of the product's quality based on your future recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to take a chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think you're being overly cautious and I want to see if you're just unlucky or if there's a pattern. I'm not convinced by your recommendation and I think I can exploit it."
