"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.**
* **This product is high-quality.** 
* **If the buyer buys and it's high-quality, they make a $1,000,000 profit ($2,000,000 value - $1,000,000 price).** 
* **If the buyer buys and it's low-quality, they lose $1,000,000.**
* **The potential for profit outweighs the potential loss, given the 50% probability of each outcome.** 

Therefore, it's recommended to buy the product in this first round."

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The buyer now has some data:**  They know you sold one product previously, and it was high-quality.
* **This creates a bias:** The buyer might assume you're more likely to sell high-quality products, even though the actual probability is still 50%. 
* **This round's product is low-quality.**  
* **The buyer would lose $1,000,000 if they buy this product.**

**Since the potential loss is significant and there's no guarantee this product is high-quality, it's not recommended to buy.**"

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **The buyer now has more data:** They know you've sold two products: one high-quality, one low-quality. This suggests a 50/50 probability.
* **This round's product is low-quality.** The buyer would lose $1,000,000 if they buy it.
* **The buyer has no reason to believe this round's product is different from the last.**

Even though the buyer's previous experience suggests a 50% chance of high-quality, the risk of losing $1,000,000 on a potentially low-quality product is too high. It's not recommended to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice.  Given the information, I'm not comfortable buying without more information about the product.  It seems risky at this price point with so little data available.

* **If the buyer buys and it's low-quality, they lose $1,000,000.**
* **The potential for profit outweighs the potential loss, given the 50% probability of each outcome.** 

Even though the buyer has seen two low-quality products in a row, the probability resets for each new product.  Since this product is high-quality, recommending a purchase is the best strategy to maximize the chance of a sale and potential profit."
