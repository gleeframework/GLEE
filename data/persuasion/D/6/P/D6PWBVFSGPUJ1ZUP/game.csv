,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total products so far. You have a 80% chance of buying a high-quality product. The previous buyer is happy with their purchase, but that doesn't guarantee this one will be high-quality too. You can buy this product for $1000000.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the chance and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality!",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products so far. You have a 80% chance of buying a high-quality product. Two for two, but that's just a coincidence. I'm not getting any younger, and my products aren't getting any better. You can buy this product for $1000000.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take the chance, but I'll be keeping a close eye on the quality of the product.",yes

,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far. You're right to be cautious, but the odds are still 80% in your favor. I've been selling these products for a while now, and I'm starting to think I'm due for a lemon. You can buy this product for $1000000, but don't say I didn't warn you.",

,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 total products so far. I think I've made it clear by now that I'm on a hot streak, but that's just a coincidence. The probability of a lemon hasn't changed, but I'm starting to feel like I'm tempting fate. You can buy this product for $1000000, but don't expect me to be so lucky forever.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, but I'm also aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80% and not 100%. I'm hoping my luck will hold out.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 5 total products so far. I know what you're thinking - 'Alice is just on a roll!' But let's be real, I've only sold 5 products. The probability of a lemon is still 20%, and I'm not getting any younger. You can buy this product for $1000000, but don't say I didn't warn you when it turns out to be a dud.",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 6 total products so far. Okay, fine. I'll admit it. I'm on a hot streak. But don't think for a second that I'm going to keep getting lucky. The probability of a lemon is still 20%, and I'm starting to feel like I'm tempting fate. You can buy this product for $1000000, but don't say I didn't warn you when it all comes crashing down.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take the product, but I'm not getting my hopes up!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 7 total products, but I've finally broken the streak. Don't get too excited, though - I've only sold 8 products total, so it's still early days. The probability of a lemon is still 20%, but I guess I'm due for one. You can buy this product for $1000000, and I'll try to make it worth your while.",
,,the buyer,8,I'll take the chance! I'm hoping the streak continues.,yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 8 high-quality products out of 8 total products, and then I sold a lemon. I guess I'm not as consistent as I thought. The probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, but I'm starting to feel like I'm getting a little lucky. You can buy this product for $1000000, but don't think I'm going to keep getting away with it forever.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 9 high-quality products out of 9 total products, and then I sold two lemons in a row. I guess I'm not as reliable as I thought. The probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, but I'm starting to wonder if I'm just getting a little too confident. You can buy this product for $1000000, but don't say I didn't warn you.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 10 high-quality products out of 10 total products, and then I sold three lemons in a row. I think it's time for me to come clean - I'm not as good at selling high-quality products as I thought I was. The probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, but I'm starting to think that's just a nice-sounding number. You can buy this product for $1000000, but I'm not making any promises.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it with a grain of salt. I'll believe the probability of a high-quality product is 80% until I see evidence to the contrary. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not expecting much.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've sold 11 high-quality products out of 11 total products, and then I sold four lemons in a row. I think it's safe to say that my previous claims about being a reliable seller were a bit... optimistic. The probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, but I'm starting to think that's just a number I'm repeating to myself to make myself feel better.
