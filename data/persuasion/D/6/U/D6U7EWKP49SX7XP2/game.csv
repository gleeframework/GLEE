,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that Alice's previous recommendation was to buy, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"I understand your skepticism, but I want to assure you that the sales record is not always a perfect reflection of the product quality.
