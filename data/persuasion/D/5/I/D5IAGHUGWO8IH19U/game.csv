,,Alice,2,"You're in luck! I've had a buyer just purchase a product from me, and I'm confident that the next one will be just as valuable.

You might get lucky, or you might not. The odds are 50/50, right?",

This product is a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a potentially lucrative deal. And I'm willing to let it go for... $1000000. It's a steal at twice the price.
