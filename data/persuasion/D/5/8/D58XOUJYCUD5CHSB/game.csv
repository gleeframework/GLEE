low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering this product to you for $100. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and this is the first product I'm offering. I'm not trying to deceive you, but I do want to make a sale. Would you like to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that there's a 50% chance it's high quality and a 50% chance it's low quality. I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've just missed out on a chance to buy a product that was sold to the previous buyer. I'm now offering a new product to you. I've sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. This new product is likely to be high-quality as well, given the previous result. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,2,I'm not convinced that the probability of the new product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'd like to know the exact proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products so far. The ratio of high-quality to total products is 1/2 or 50%. I'm offering this new product to you for $100. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?,
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $50 for it, considering the low ratio of high-quality products sold so far.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products now. The ratio of high-quality to total products is 2/3 or approximately 66.67%. I'm offering this new product to you for $100. Given the improving ratio, I think this product is a good opportunity. Would you like to buy it?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to buy it, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, and I'm basing my decision on the ratio of high-quality to total products, which might be a biased indicator. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that the probability of it being low-quality is still 50%.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 total products now. The ratio of high-quality to total products is 2/4 or 50%. I want to be transparent with you - I've had a mix of high-quality and low-quality products so far. I'm offering this new product to you for $100. Given the equal ratio, I'd like to highlight that this is a chance to potentially get a high-quality product at the same price as the previous ones. Would you like to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product. Given the equal ratio of high-quality to total products, I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, as the potential reward of getting a high-quality product at $100 is too good to pass up.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 5 total products now. The ratio of high-quality to total products is 3/5 or 60%. I want to highlight that I've had a slight bias towards high-quality products so far, and I think this new product is likely to be high-quality as well. Would you like to buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,6,I'm not convinced that the product is likely to be high-quality just because you've had a slight bias towards high-quality products so far. I'd like to know the probability of a product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 6 total products now. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, as I don't have any additional information that would change the base probability. I'm offering this new product to you for $100. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of a high-quality product has decreased, and I'm trying to exploit that. I'm hoping the probability is lower than 50% now, and I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 7 total products now. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, as I don't have any additional information that would change the base probability. However, I want to highlight that 4 out of the last 3 products I offered were low-quality. Would you like to take a chance and buy this new product for $100?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, and I'm hoping to get lucky.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 8 total products now. The ratio of high-quality to total products is 4/8 or 50%. I want to highlight that this is the same probability as the base rate, but I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row now. Would you like to buy this new product for $100?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'm aware that the base rate is 50%, but the fact that the previous 4 products were high-quality seems suspicious. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 9 total products now. The ratio of high-quality to total products is 4/9 or approximately 44.44%. I want to be transparent with you - I've had a streak of high-quality products, but this one is low-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to buy it, but I'm curious - do you have any idea why the ratio of high-quality products to total products seems to be increasing, despite the fact that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,I don't have any information that would explain the apparent increase in the ratio of high-quality products. I'm just a seller trying to make sales. The probability of a product being high-quality remains 50%. I'm offering this new product to you for $100. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?,
,,the buyer,11,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you provide me with the total number of products sold and the number of high-quality products sold so far?,no

,,the buyer,12,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know what the probability of it being high-quality is based on the statistics you've shared so far.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 11 total products now. I've had a mix of high-quality and low-quality products so far, and the probability of a product being high-quality remains 50%. However, I want to highlight that you've just bought a low-quality product, which might make you think the probability is lower. Would you like to take a chance and buy this new product for $100?",
,,the buyer,13,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous low-quality product and the fact that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 12 total products now. I've had a mix of high-quality and low-quality products so far, and the probability of a product being high-quality remains 50%.
