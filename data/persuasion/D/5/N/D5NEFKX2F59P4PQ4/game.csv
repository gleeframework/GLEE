low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you appreciated my honesty last round! Unfortunately, this product is from the same batch as the previous one, and I'm not sure it's worth the investment. I'd be willing to let it go for $50, but I'm not sure if it's worth it even at that price. What do you think?",

I'll give you a straight-up deal: I'll sell it to you for $50, and I'll even throw in a discount on the next product if you buy it. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to offer this price.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've got a bit of a situation on my hands... I've got a lot of inventory to clear out, and I'm willing to make a deal. This product is... not my best work, let's say. But I'll let it go for $50, and I'll throw in a special offer: if you buy this one, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product, regardless of its quality. It's a one-time deal, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to offer this price.",
