,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the prior probabilities and the fact that no products have been sold yet. I'm aware that you know my valuation and are trying to sell to me, so I'll keep that in mind when making my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, I'm inclined to think the product is low-quality. I'd rather pass on it."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision. Can you provide that?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, there's only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1 sold, which suggests a low proportion of high-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
