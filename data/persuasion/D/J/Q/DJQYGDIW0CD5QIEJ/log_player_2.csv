Alice's message: Good question! Since we've sold 1 product so far, and 1 out of 2 products are high-quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. We're actually on a streak of low-quality products, but that doesn't mean the next one won't be a gem! We're still offering this product to you for $100, and we think it's a great opportunity.
