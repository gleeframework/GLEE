,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, which means the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the information that you don't recommend it, which suggests it might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm not getting any better information than that."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the current statistics and Alice's recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, and Alice's recommendation, it seems like the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk based on the current statistics. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 33.33%, but I'll take a chance and buy it anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's because I'm optimistic or if the lack of high-quality products sold so far is a red flag. Can you explain your reasoning for not recommending it?"

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the products, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than the true probability of 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product, suggesting a low-quality product is more likely to be the case."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are accurate, and all 5 previous buyers who bought the product received a low-quality one.
