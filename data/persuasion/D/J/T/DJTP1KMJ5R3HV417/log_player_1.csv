  ""message"": ""I understand your concerns and I'm willing to be more transparent about the confidence interval calculation. I'll provide you with the exact formula I used to calculate the 90% confidence interval, which is based on the binomial distribution. The formula is: CI = (p ± 1.645 * sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)), where p is the proportion of high-quality products sold (0.2778) and n is the total number of products sold (18). This gives us a confidence interval of approximately 0.165 to 0.390. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $5000, which is a 50% discount from the original price. I think this is a great opportunity to get a low-quality product at a discounted price.""
