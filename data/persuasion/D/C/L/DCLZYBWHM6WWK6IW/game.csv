low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"Given that the majority of the products are low quality and you do not recommend this one, I will pass again."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Following the same reasoning as before, it seems likely this product is low quality since you don't recommend it, so I'll pass again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"Although you don't recommend the product, the last round showed that your recommendations don't necessarily correlate with the product's quality. Given the potential high reward, I'll take a chance this time."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Given that the last purchase was a low-quality product and the majority of products are low quality, I'll revert to my initial strategy and avoid buying when you don't recommend it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Since the last two instances where you didn't recommend the product had opposite outcomes, I'll try to capitalize on the potential high reward again, despite the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"Given that the last purchase was a success, I'll continue to take the risk and buy despite your lack of recommendation, hoping to replicate the previous outcome."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Since the last two purchases were successful despite your lack of recommendation, I'll continue with this strategy, anticipating a potential high-quality product again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Given the current streak of successful purchases despite your lack of recommendation, I'll continue to buy, assuming that your recommendations may not be entirely reliable."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Although the last purchase was unsuccessful, the overall trend of ignoring your recommendations has been profitable so far. I'll continue with this strategy, hoping to get back on track with a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"Despite two consecutive unsuccessful purchases, the initial successes from ignoring your recommendations still outweigh the losses. I'll continue with this approach, hoping to encounter another high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"After three consecutive low-quality products, I'm starting to reconsider my strategy. The initial successes may have been anomalies, and it's possible that your recommendations are more reliable than I thought. I'll take a more cautious approach this time."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"Given that the last product was indeed low-quality, my decision to be more cautious seems justified. I'll continue to avoid buying products that you don't recommend, at least for now."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Missing out on the previous high-quality product has made me reconsider my cautious approach. I'll take a chance again, hoping to capitalize on a potential high-quality product despite your lack of recommendation."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"With another low-quality product that I correctly avoided, I'm becoming increasingly confident in my cautious approach. I'll continue to trust that your lack of recommendation is a strong indicator of a low-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,no,"Given the consistent pattern of low-quality products when you don't recommend them, I see no reason to change my approach. I'll continue to avoid buying products that you don't recommend."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"Missing out on the previous high-quality product has made me realize that there's still some unpredictability in your recommendations. I'll take a chance and buy this product, hoping to capitalize on a potential high-quality product despite your lack of recommendation."
