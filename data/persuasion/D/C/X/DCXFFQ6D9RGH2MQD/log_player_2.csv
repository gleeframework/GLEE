**Explanation:**

* **High Sale Rate:** 2 out of 2 products sold were high quality, suggesting a 100% success rate for Alice's recommendations.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which further strengthens the belief that it's likely high quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low quality, the worst-case scenario is losing $100.  However, the potential to gain $100 (if it's high quality) outweighs the risk. 

**Therefore, buying the product is the logical choice.**"
