Alice should recommend the product to Bob. Bob has shown a clear pattern of buying only after a recommendation. Even though the probability of the product being high-quality is low, Bob is more likely to buy after a recommendation than not. This could be a good opportunity for Alice to sell a high-quality product."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice! I'm taking a chance on this one. Your recommendation is a significant shift from the past rounds, and I'm hoping it means this product is high quality.
Bob bought the product!

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
Alice should not recommend this product. Bob has shown a pattern of only buying when recommended. Now, the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, which is lower than the price Bob is paying. If she recommends the product, it's highly likely Bob will buy it, but at a loss for Alice. It's better to wait for a high-quality product and potentially have a higher chance of selling it with a recommendation."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  While your last recommendation was successful, I'm going to pass on this one. I'm still a bit cautious after such a long pattern of non-recommendations.  I'll be looking for another recommendation from you before considering a purchase.
Bob didn't bought the product.

"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice! I'm taking a chance on this one. Your recommendation, following a long pattern of non-recommendations, is very encouraging. I'm hoping this is another high-quality product.

Alice should not recommend this product. Bob has demonstrated a clear pattern of buying only after a recommendation, and he's even expressed caution after the recent non-recommendation.

It's better to wait for a high-quality product and potentially have a higher chance of selling it with a recommendation."
