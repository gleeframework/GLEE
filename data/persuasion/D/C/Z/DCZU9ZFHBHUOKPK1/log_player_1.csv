As for the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the first buyer, considering our overall product quality rate is 80%, it's actually higher than that.

If you're willing to take a chance, I think you'll be very happy with your purchase.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your reasoning. If the probability of the product being high-quality is 100%, then you should have no doubt in your mind that it's high-quality, and you should offer it to me for $20000, not $10000. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at the same price as a high-quality one.

In fact, the first 3 products sold were all high-quality, and then there was a streak of 2 low-quality products. The last 2 products sold were also high-quality.
