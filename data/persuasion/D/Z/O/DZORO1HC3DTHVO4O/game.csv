,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'll take the risk and see what I get."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that the first buyer didn't buy after your recommendation, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a product without knowing the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is very low, which makes me skeptical about the value of this product. I'd rather wait for more data or pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendation. Can you provide more information about the product before I make a decision?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know what led you to recommend not buying it. Is it based on the previous buyer's decision or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that you know the product's quality and are trying to influence my decision, but I'll take the risk and buy it anyway."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, and the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the previous products were likely low-quality. Given the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, it's possible that the previous products were all low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product to see if I can get a better chance at a high-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have received low-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to see more information about the previous products before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's lack of recommendation. I'm hoping that the product is low quality and I can get it for $1000000, which is a great deal compared to the $0 it's worth to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'm worried that the low-quality products are being hidden, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm starting to suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being recommended is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for a recommendation that is more likely to be high-quality."
