,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4, the probability of the product being high quality is still 80%.
