low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 1 low-quality product so far. I'm still a relatively new seller, and I'm not yet at the point where I can confidently say I've established a track record. However, I'm willing to take on the risk and sell you a product with a 1 in 3 chance of being worth $30000 to you. It's a gamble, but it might just pay off. The price remains at $10000.",

I'm willing to sell you a product with a 1 in 3 chance of being worth $30000 to you. It's a calculated risk, but I think it's worth considering.",
