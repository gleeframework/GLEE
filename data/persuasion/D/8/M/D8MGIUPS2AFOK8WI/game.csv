,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I understand that you don't have any prior information, and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 attempts, which suggests a very low probability of the product being high-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I know the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given the seller's recommendation pattern and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. Your lack of recommendation suggests that you might have seen a low-quality product, which would be a good deal for me. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure if I should buy it, but I'll pass. I'd like to know the quality of the product, and I'm hesitant to buy without more information. Maybe if you could provide more context or insights about the previous sales, I could make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record and what led you to recommend against it?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd also like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Can you share that with me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this opportunity and let the next buyer decide."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the fact that 5 buyers have already passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, and none of the products sold were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall proportion of high-quality products. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous buyers didn't find the product valuable enough to buy it, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe the product might be low quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers, including those who received your recommendations, have not purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous 5 buyers didn't buy the products or because of some other factor?
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is lower than the overall 33.33%. I'm not convinced that the current product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
