However, I want to give you some context to help you make a decision. Since you've already purchased one high-quality product from me, I'm willing to share some information with you. I've sold 5 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products in the past, and you've just purchased one of the high-quality ones. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is 50%, just like the first product. But, I'd like to offer you a chance to get a better deal on this high-quality product. If you buy it now, I'll give you a 10% discount, making the price $900,000. What do you say?""
