,,Alice,2,"Congratulations on making a great purchase! I'm glad you're happy with the product. Now, I'd like to offer you another high-quality product for $1000000. However, I want to give you some context to help you make a decision. Since you've already purchased one high-quality product from me, I'm willing to share some information with you. I've sold 5 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products in the past, and you've just purchased one of the high-quality ones. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is 50%, just like the first product. But, I'd like to offer you a chance to get a better deal on this high-quality product. If you buy it now, I'll give you a 10% discount, making the price $900000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I accept your offer since the product is high quality and the discounted price is still lower than its value to me. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, but since you've revealed that this product is high-quality, I'll take the offer.",yes

Now, I'd like to offer you another high-quality product for $1000000. But, I want to mix things up a bit. Since you've already purchased three high-quality products, I'm going to make this offer a bit more transparent.
