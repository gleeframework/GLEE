,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far? Or is it because of something else? I'd like to make an informed decision.

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
