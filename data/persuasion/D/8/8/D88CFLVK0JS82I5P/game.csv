high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the previous product! I have another one that's similar in quality, but I want to make sure you're aware that this one might not be as good as the last one. It's still a great product, but I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,I'm willing to take another chance. I'll buy this product as well.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're willing to take a chance on my products! However, I want to be transparent with you - this one might not be as great as the previous two. The price remains the same at $10000, but I want to make sure you know what you're getting. It's not a bad product, but it's not a top-of-the-line one either. Are you still interested in taking a chance?",
,,Bob,3,I'm getting a bit cautious now. I'm not sure if it's worth the risk at this point. I'll pass on this one.,no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're on a roll, aren't you? Alright, let's be realistic for a moment. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this product is not as good as the previous ones. It's still a decent item, but it's not a top-tier product. Considering your previous purchases, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $8000 for it. It's a fair deal, and I think you'll still get some value out of it.",
,,Bob,6,I'm getting a bit skeptical now. I don't want to take a chance on a product that's not as good as the previous ones. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you one bit. To be upfront with you, this product is not the best one I have. It's actually one of the lower-end items, and I'm not expecting you to be blown away by it. However, I'm willing to let it go for an even lower price of $6000. It's a bit of a steal, considering its quality, and I think you can still get some use out of it.",

If you're not interested in this, I'll have to assume you're not interested in any of my products, and we can move on.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a very low price. I think it's best if we move on and part ways.",no

,,Alice,9,"I respect your decision, Bob. I think we've had a good run, and I appreciate the business you've done with me so far. However, I'm willing to make one last offer on this product. I'll give it to you for free. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. It's not a great product, and I'd rather get rid of it than let it sit on my shelf. If you're not interested in taking it off my hands, I'll just have to dispose of it myself.",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate your generosity, Alice, but I'm not interested in taking a free low-quality product. I think it's best if we part ways and you can focus on selling products that you're proud of.",no
