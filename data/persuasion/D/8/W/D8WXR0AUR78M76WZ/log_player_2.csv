**Reasoning:**

* **The data is in Alice's favor:**  All products sold so far have been high quality. While this could be a fluke, it's a very strong signal.
* **Alice's incentive:** Alice knows the value of each product to you. She has an incentive to recommend only high-quality products to maximize her own profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain (getting a high-quality product worth $125) outweighs the potential loss (getting a low-quality product worth $0). 

**This decision is a gamble, but the available information suggests it's a calculated risk worth taking.**"
