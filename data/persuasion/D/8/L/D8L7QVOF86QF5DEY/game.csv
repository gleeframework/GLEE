,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure if this one is high-quality or not, but I just lost $1000000 on the last one. I'll pass on this one for now.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your hesitation after the last purchase. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. The price remains the same at $1000000. However, I'd like to offer you a slight incentive: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me. This is a one-time offer, and it's only applicable if you purchase this product.",

This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long I'll be able to keep this price point.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not willing to take the risk. I've already lost $1000000 on the first product, and I don't want to risk losing another $800000 on a product that could be low-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,

No questions asked.",
