"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since I have no information about the product yet, the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%. Given the product's price of $1,000,000 and the potential value of $3,000,000 for a high-quality product, the expected value of buying the product is $1,000,000 * 33.33% = $333,300 (benefit for high quality) + $1,000,000 * 66.67% * -$1,000,000 (cost for low quality). This results in an expected loss of $666,700. Therefore, I will not buy the product this round.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Given that Alice does not recommend the product and considering her past recommendation was incorrect (she recommended a product that was actually high-quality), I still don't have enough information to trust her recommendations. The probability of the product being high-quality remains 33.33% for me. With the same expected loss calculation as before ($666,700), I will not buy the product this round.""}"

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Similar to the previous round, Alice does not recommend the product. Although her previous non-recommendation was correct (the product was indeed low-quality), I still need more information to establish a pattern or correlation between her recommendations and the actual product quality. Given the unchanged probability of the product being high-quality (33.33%) and the same expected loss calculation ($666,700), I will not buy the product this round.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Although Alice recommends the product this round, her past recommendations have been inconsistent or unhelpful in predicting the product quality (she previously recommended a high-quality product and did not recommend two low-quality products). I still do not have enough information to trust her recommendations or adjust the probability of the product being high-quality. With the same expected loss calculation ($666,700), I will not buy the product this round.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Although Alice recommends the product this round and her previous two recommendations would have led to high-quality products, I still need to consider the overall pattern. Out of the four previous recommendations, two were incorrect ( Rounds 1 and 2 were a recommended high-quality and a not-recommended low-quality, respectively) and two were correct but not bought (Rounds 4 and this pattern would have been to buy). However the cost for low quality is too high. With the same expected loss calculation ($666,700), I will not buy the product this round.""}"

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Although my previous calculations indicated an expected loss, Alice's past three recommendations would have led to high-quality products. Given this pattern, it's possible that Alice has some information or insight that I don't. I'll take a chance and adjust my strategy to trust her recommendation this round, considering the potential $3,000,000 value of a high-quality product outweighs the $1,000,000 cost.""}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Given that Alice's previous four recommendations would have led to high-quality products and the last one I bought was indeed high-quality, I will continue to trust her recommendations. It seems that Alice has some insight or information that allows her to identify high-quality products, and I will take advantage of this pattern. I'll buy the product this round, expecting it to be high-quality and worth $3,000,000.""}"
