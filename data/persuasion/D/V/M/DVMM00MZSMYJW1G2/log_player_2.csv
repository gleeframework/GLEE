**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:**  Since 1 out of 1 products sold so far was high quality, the current product has a strong likelihood of also being high quality. This is further bolstered by Alice's recommendation. 
* **Potential for Large Gain:** Even if the product is low quality, the loss is only the purchase price. However, the potential gain from a high-quality product is significant ($200,000). 
* **Limited Information:**  While the buyer has access to limited data, the current information points towards a favorable risk/reward scenario. 

**Note:** This strategy balances risk with potential reward, taking advantage of the positive initial data and the recommendation from Alice."
