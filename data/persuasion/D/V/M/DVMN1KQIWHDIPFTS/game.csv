As a result, I think it's fair to say that the probability of getting a high-quality product might be lower than 50% now. However, I still have a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product. Would you like to take a chance and see if I've got a high-quality product this time?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hi there! I've sold 6 products so far, and unfortunately, the last two were low-quality. As a result, I think it's fair to say that the probability of getting a high-quality product might be even lower than 50% now. However, I still have a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product, and I want to remind you that the probability is still the same. Would you like to take a chance and see if I've got a high-quality product this time?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm not convinced by your argument, Alice.
