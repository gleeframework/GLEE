"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality, and Bob knows that high-quality products have an 80% probability, it's in Bob's best interest to buy.  Even though he doesn't know the exact value of the product, the odds are in his favor."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob passed on the last product, the information about the product's quality is not shared with him.  He only knows you did not recommend it.  He still has the same 80% chance of getting a high-quality product this round, so recommending it is the best strategy."
"Bob's message: Alice, your recommendations seem to be working! I'll take another one.
Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

"Bob's message: I'm feeling lucky! I'll take another chance on your recommendation, Alice.
Bob bought the product!

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Continuing the pattern, recommending the product is the optimal strategy.  We don't have information about how Bob is making his decisions, and even though he has bought high-quality products before, we don't know if he is connecting the pattern.  Since the product is high-quality, recommending it gives you the best chance of selling it."
