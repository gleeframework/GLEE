**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** There's not enough data to make a confident decision. We only know that one previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, and Alice is not recommending this product.
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the true quality of the product and is intentionally not recommending it. This suggests a high probability of it being low quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a high-quality product ($120) is tempting, but the risk of a low-quality product ($0) is significant.

**Conclusion:**  The lack of information and Alice's lack of recommendation create too much uncertainty. It's better to pass on the product and avoid the risk."
