Alice's message: I'm glad you asked about my sales record! I've sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've already sold a high-quality one, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 80% * (1/1) = 80%. However, I'd like to offer you a special deal on this high-quality product. It's still only $100, but I'm willing to throw in a 20% discount on the next product if you buy this one.
