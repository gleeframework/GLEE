**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:**  Since 1 out of 1 products sold was high quality, the probability of the current product being high quality is significantly higher than the 80% baseline.  
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  While Alice knows the true quality, she has an incentive to sell. Therefore, her recommendation to buy increases the likelihood of the product being high quality.
* **Potential Upside:** The potential payoff of a high-quality product ($300) is significantly greater than the price ($100). 
* **Limited Risk:** The downside is only losing the $100 if the product is low quality. 

Given the high probability of a high-quality product and Alice's recommendation, the risk-reward ratio favors buying."

* **Value:** A high-quality product is worth $300 to me, and the price is $100. This is a guaranteed profit.
