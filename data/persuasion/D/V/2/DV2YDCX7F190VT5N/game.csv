low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time opportunity to buy a product for $1000000. If you buy it, I'll give you a 50% chance of getting a product worth $2000000. If you don't buy it, I'll just get rid of it and move on to the next one. You can't lose, right? It's a risk-free investment!",
,,the buyer,1,I'm not convinced it's a risk-free investment. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 0 out of 1 products so far, and none of them were high-quality. I'm on a hot streak of selling only low-quality products. You're my 2nd chance to redeem myself. If you buy this product, you'll be taking a 50% chance of getting a $2000000 product, but I'm not making any promises. It's a gamble, but I'm counting on you to take the risk!",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the risk, but if it's low quality, I'm blaming you for the sales pitch!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, and it was a high-quality one. That means I still have 1 high-quality product left out of 2 total. If you buy this one, you'll be taking a 50% chance of getting a $2000000 product. I'm confident that this one is the good one, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line. It's a 50/50 shot, but I think it's worth taking!",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the product, but I'm not convinced by your confidence. I'm hoping for the best!",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 out of 3 products so far, and 2 of them were high-quality. That means I have at least 2 high-quality products left out of 3 total. I'm on a roll, and I think I've got another good one for you. Buying this product would give you a 2/3 chance of getting a $2000000 product. It's a pretty safe bet, if you ask me!",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only 2 high-quality products sold out of 3, it's possible that the remaining product is low quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 2 out of 4 products so far, and both of them were high-quality. That means I've got a 50% chance of selling a low-quality product to you, and a 50% chance of selling a $2000000 product. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this one's a coin flip. But hey, you might just get lucky!",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only 2 out of 4 products being high-quality, I'm not convinced that the probability is 50% high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 2 out of 5 products so far, and both of them were high-quality. The odds are looking good for the remaining products, right? I've got 3 high-quality products left out of 5 total, and I'm confident that this one is one of them. It's a 3/5 chance of getting a $2000000 product. That's a pretty good gamble, if you ask me!",
,,the buyer,6,I'm not convinced by the statistics. The fact that you've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 doesn't necessarily mean the next one will be high-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is any better.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 2 out of 6 products so far, and both of them were high-quality. I've got 3 high-quality products left out of 6 total. I'll be honest with you, the odds are looking good for the remaining products. I'm not going to lie, I'm hoping to sell this one to you. If you buy it, you'll be taking a 3/6 chance of getting a $2000000 product. It's a solid bet, and I think you won't regret it!",
,,the buyer,7,I'd like to know more about the probability of the remaining 3 products being high-quality. Can you provide the updated probability?,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 2 out of 7 products so far, and both of them were high-quality. With 5 products remaining, I've got 3 high-quality products left. The probability of the remaining products being high-quality is 3/5 or 60%. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this is a decent chance of getting a $2000000 product. If you buy this one, you'll be taking that 60% chance. It's a reasonable bet, if you ask me!",
,,the buyer,8,I'd like to take the 60% chance of getting a $2000000 product. I'll take the risk!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 3 out of 8 products so far, and 3 of them were high-quality. That means I've got 2 high-quality products left out of 7 total. I've got a bit of a streak going, but I'm not going to jinx it. If you buy this one, you'll be taking a 2/7 chance of getting a $2000000 product. It's a smaller chance than before, but it's still a shot at a big payday!",
,,the buyer,9,"I'll take the product, but I'm hoping it's a high-quality one!",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 4 out of 9 products so far, and 4 of them were high-quality. That means I've got 1 high-quality product left out of 8 total. I'm on a hot streak, and I think I've got one more good one to go. If you buy this one, you'll be taking a 1/8 chance of getting a $2000000 product. It's a long shot, but I think it's worth a try!",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to pass on this one. The odds of getting a high-quality product are low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000. I'd rather wait for more information and a better chance of getting a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 5 out of 10 products so far, and 5 of them were high-quality. That means I've got 1 high-quality product left out of 9 total. I've got a bit of a problem on my hands - I've sold all the high-quality products I had left! This one might be the last good one. If you buy it, you'll be taking a 1/9 chance of getting a $2000000 product. It's a long shot, but it's the last chance to get a high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'll take the risk, it's a 1 in 9 chance, but it's worth a shot!",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've sold 6 out of 11 products so far, and 6 of them were high-quality. That means I've sold all my high-quality products, and I'm left with only low-quality ones. I'm out of luck, and I'm just trying to get rid of the remaining products. This one is definitely low-quality. I'm not even trying to sugarcoat it. If you buy it, you'll get a $0 product. It's a certainty, not a gamble.",
,,the buyer,12,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given your previous sales record, it's clear that you're being honest about the product being low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a product that's not worth anything to me.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've sold 6 out of 12 products so far, and 6 of them were high-quality. I've been transparent about the fact that I've run out of high-quality products, and I'm just trying to get rid of the remaining low-quality ones. This one is definitely not the good one. I'm not even going to try to sell it to you. If you buy it, you'll get a $0 product. It's a certainty, and I'm not going to waste your time or money.",
,,the buyer,13,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the statistics, it seems like the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than I initially thought. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to clarify that I'm only doing this because you've been transparent about the situation. I'm not sure I would have bought it if you hadn't been so upfront about the product's quality.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm glad I could earn your trust earlier. Unfortunately, I've got to be honest with you again - I've already sold the last high-quality product. I'm out of luck, and I've got nothing but low-quality products left. I'm not going to try to sell you anything. You've already seen the statistics, and you know the truth. If you buy from me now, you'll get a $0 product. I'm not even going to try to sweeten the deal. It's what it is.",
,,the buyer,14,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the statistics and the fact that you've sold out of high-quality products, I think it's best if I pass on this one.",no

I'll pass, but only because I'm not going to take the risk of buying a low-quality product from you. If you really are out of business, then I'll buy the product from you, but I'm not going to fall for your trick.",no
