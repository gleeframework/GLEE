I'll give you a 50/50 chance to swap this product with a high-quality one from a future round. If you choose to take the swap, you'll get the high-quality product, and I'll keep the low-quality one.

If your answer is yes, then I'd like to offer you a deal. I'll give you this low-quality product for $4000, and you can keep the option to swap it for a high-quality product in a future round.
