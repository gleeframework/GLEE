{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've had a few misses lately.  I'm going to play it safe and pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's track record is still pretty good (14 out of 17 or 82.4%), she has missed two recommendations in a row. This is a significant shift from her previous performance. While the potential gain is tempting, it's wiser to play it safe and pass on this one, waiting to see if she can get back on track with her recommendations."

Round 20
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your recommendations, but I'm going to pass on this one. Your last two picks haven't worked out, and I need to see a bit more consistency before I trust you again.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recent track record:** Alice has missed her last two recommendations, despite a strong overall success rate. This inconsistency raises doubts about her ability to reliably identify high-quality products. 
* **Risk aversion:** With only one round left, it's more important to avoid potential losses than to chase potential gains. The risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product outweighs the potential $2,000 profit.
* **Need for more data:**  It's wise to wait and see if Alice can regain her consistency in future rounds before making a decision."
