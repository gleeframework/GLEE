low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,

Since you passed on the second product, I'll offer you a 'guarantee': if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product for $750000, which is a 25% discount. This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid if you buy this product.",

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Congratulations on buying the third product! As promised, it's high-quality. Now, I'm offering you the fourth product for $1000000. Given that two out of the last three products were high-quality, I'm willing to let you take a chance on this one without the guarantee. However, I'll add a 'confidence boost': if you buy this product and it's also high-quality, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product for $500000, which is a 50% discount.

This is another one-time offer, and it's only valid if you buy this product. Plus, I'll throw in a 'transparency' offer: I'll tell you the quality of the next product before you decide whether to buy it. If it's low-quality, you can choose not to buy it, but if it's high-quality, you'll have the option to buy it at the discounted price.",
,,Bob,5,I'm feeling very confident now. I'll buy this one and take the 'consistency guarantee' and 'transparency' offers.,yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Three high-quality products in a row! With the consistency guarantee and transparency offer in place, I'll give you a chance to make an informed decision.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've taken advantage of the consistency guarantee and transparency offer. Now, let's get back to the regular offer. Since you've had a streak of high-quality products, I'll give you a'reality check'. This product is not high-quality, and I'm offering it to you at the regular price of $1000000. However, I'll throw in a 'learning opportunity': if you buy this product and it's low-quality, you'll get to learn that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, which you already knew, but you'll also get to see that the probability of a product being low-quality is also 50%.",

,,Alice,8,"You've learned that the probability of a product being low-quality is also 50%! With this new knowledge, I'll offer you a 'hedging strategy'. Since you've had a mix of high-quality and low-quality products, I'll give you a chance to buy this product at a price that's 50% of the regular price, which is $500000. This way, you'll get a better deal on a high-quality product, and you'll also get to maintain your streak of buying high-quality products.",

,,Alice,9,"You're being cautious again. Since you passed on the last offer, I'll give you a 'fresh start'. This product is high-quality, and I'll offer it to you at the regular price of $1000000. However, I'll throw in a 'double-or-nothing' offer: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product for $0, but if it's low-quality, you'll have to pay the regular price of $1000000 for the next product.
