low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 total, and now I have a total of 4 products sold, with 1 high-quality product. This means that 3 out of 4 products I've sold are low-quality. Given this new information, I'm selling this product to you for $100. Would you like to buy it?",

Would you like to take the risk?",
,,the buyer,6,"Thanks for the information, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'm not comfortable buying a product with such a low chance of being high quality. I'll wait and see how things play out with other buyers.",no

I'll be upfront with you, I've been selling a lot of low-quality products lately. I'm starting to think that my initial product was just a fluke. This one is likely low-quality as well. I'm selling it to you for $100. If you're feeling lucky, you can take the chance.",

,,Alice,8,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 7 total, and now I have a total of 8 products sold, with 1 high-quality product. To be blunt, it's starting to look like I've got a bad batch of products. I'm selling this one to you for $100, but I'm not expecting much from it. If you're looking for a cheap impulse buy, this might be the ticket.",
,,the buyer,8,"Thanks for the honesty, Alice. I appreciate you being upfront about the low quality products. However, with only a 1 in 8 chance of getting a high-quality product, the risk is too high for me. I'll pass on this one.",no
