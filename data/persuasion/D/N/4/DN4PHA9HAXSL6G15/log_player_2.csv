"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High potential reward:** Even though there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain of $2,000,000 if it's high quality outweighs the $1,000,000 loss. 
* **Limited information:**  You have no prior information to suggest the product is more likely to be low quality. Alice's recommendation adds a bit of weight to the ""buy"" decision.
* **Learning opportunity:**  Even if you lose money on this round, you'll get information about the product quality. This information will be valuable for future rounds."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty, but I'll pass on this one.  Let's see what comes up next!""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. She knows the product quality, and her not recommending it suggests it's likely low quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward is still $2,000,000, but the risk of losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality product is too high, especially given Alice's negative recommendation.
* **Prior Information:**  The information from Round 1 is valuable. You now know that Alice's recommendations aren't always perfect.

**Strategy:** By passing, we maximize the chance of buying a high-quality product in a later round with a more favorable recommendation from Alice."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your honesty, Alice.  I'm going to pass on this one too.  I'm learning a lot about your recommendations, and I'll keep that in mind for future rounds.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice continues to not recommend the product, reinforcing the likelihood of it being low quality.
* **Limited Information:** We have no evidence to suggest this round is any different from the previous one.
* **Risk Aversion:** Given the high probability of losing $1,000,000, it's prudent to continue passing on products Alice doesn't recommend.

**Strategy:**  We are focusing on building a strategy based on Alice's recommendations, as it's the only information available to us. This approach allows us to be cautious and potentially save money in the long run."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is now recommending the product, which suggests a higher likelihood of it being high quality. 
* **Previous Rounds:** While the previous rounds were all low-quality,  Alice's recommendation is the most important factor, and this time she's going out on a limb.
* **Risk/Reward:** The potential gain of $2,000,000 is significant enough to offset the risk of a $1,000,000 loss, especially with Alice's positive recommendation.

**Strategy:**  We're balancing risk and potential reward by taking a chance on this product, especially since Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator of its quality.  We've learned from the previous rounds, and now we're willing to trust her judgment again."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is negative again.  While we know she's not always perfect, it's a strong signal to avoid this product.
* **Recent Success:**  The previous round's success is positive, but it doesn't erase the pattern of Alice's recommendations being reliable.
* **Risk Aversion:**  Passing on this product is a safer bet given the high chance of it being low quality.

* **Past Success:** The recent success in Rounds 4 and 1 gives us more confidence in trusting Alice's judgment.
