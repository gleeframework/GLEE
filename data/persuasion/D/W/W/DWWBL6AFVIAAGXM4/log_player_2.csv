{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation!  I'll take it. I'm excited to be the first buyer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No past data:** There's no information about past sales to influence my decision.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Since Alice knows the true value of the product, her recommendation carries weight.  
* **Potential gain:**  Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the risk of losing $100.

**Note:** This is a gamble, but the odds are in my favor. I'm willing to take the risk based on the information available."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** With 12 high-quality products sold out of 12 purchases, the success rate is 100%. This suggests Alice is perfectly able to identify high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Since Alice knows the value of each product to the buyer, her recommendation carries significant weight.  
* **Potential Loss:** Passing would mean missing out on a product that is almost certainly high quality, given the past results. 

While there is still a small chance the product is low quality, the overwhelming evidence from previous sales and Alice's recommendation makes buying the product the logical choice."
