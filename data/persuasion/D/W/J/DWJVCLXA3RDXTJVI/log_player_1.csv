"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is low-quality and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, they would rationally choose not to buy.  A low-quality product has no value to them, and the risk of losing $1,000,000 outweighs the potential chance of getting a high-quality product."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product and no products have been sold yet to establish a pattern, I will trust her recommendation and pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, you have a high-quality product.  While the buyer doesn't know this, they do know the following:

* **Probability of high-quality:** 33.33%
* **Value of a high-quality product:** $2,000,000
* **Value of a low-quality product:** $0
* **Price:** $1,000,000

This means the buyer has a 33.33% chance of making a profit of $1,000,000. It's a gamble, but a good one.  Since they haven't seen any previous sales, they have no basis to distrust you. In this scenario, the expected value of the purchase is positive, and they should buy."
"The buyer's message: Since there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality and no sales record to rely on, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value of a high-quality product:** $2,000,000
* **Value of a low-quality product:** $0
* **Price:** $1,000,000
* **Past sales:** 0 (meaning no pattern to draw upon)

The buyer's decision in the previous round is irrelevant. This round presents a fresh opportunity.  Again, the expected value of the purchase is positive due to the potential profit of $1,000,000 with a 33.33% chance.  You should still recommend buying."
