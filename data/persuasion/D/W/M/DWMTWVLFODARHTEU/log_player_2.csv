Alice's message: This is a rare opportunity to buy a product at a fixed price of $1000000. I've sold one high-quality product already, and now I have another one available. I'm not sure if this one is high-quality or not, but the odds are against it. If you're willing to take the risk, this could be a great deal. If not, I'll sell it to the next person who's willing to take a chance.

Alice's message: I've sold two products so far, and both were sold at the same price. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's likely that I've sold a low-quality product in the second round. If I were to sell a high-quality product at this price, I would have done so already. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I'm not sure if it's high-quality or not. You might want to consider the fact that I've already sold two products at this price, and one of them was likely low-quality.

Alice's message: I've sold three products now, and two of them were low-quality. This means that the first product I sold was high-quality, and the last two were low-quality. Given this pattern, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to buy a high-quality product at the same price as the low-quality ones.
