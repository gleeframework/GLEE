Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, Bob. Let me put it this way: this product has been extensively tested and validated by industry experts. It's a proven winner, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's significantly lower than its true value. Think about the potential returns on investment you could get from this product. $1000000 is a small price to pay for a chance to get ahead of the competition and make a substantial profit. Are you ready to take the leap and seize this opportunity?
