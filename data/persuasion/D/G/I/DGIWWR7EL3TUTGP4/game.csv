,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making my decision. Can you provide the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not convinced yet, I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since I have no prior information to rely on."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'll take that into account, but I'll still make my own decision based on the probability of it being high-quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5, which is lower than the true probability of a high-quality product (0.8). I suspect that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products, so I'll pass."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I think it's a low-quality one and I don't want to risk buying it for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased, I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far. I'm not convinced that the product is likely to be high quality based on the statistics."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the probability of it being high quality seems low given the previous sales record. I'd like to know more about the product before making a purchase."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current sales record. Can you provide the probability?

,,Alice,17,yes,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the overall probability. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,the buyer,19,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
