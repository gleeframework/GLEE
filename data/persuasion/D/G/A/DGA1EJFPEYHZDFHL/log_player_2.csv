Since our first potential buyer didn't take the bait, I've now sold 1 out of 1 product so far, and 1 out of 1 of those products was high-quality. This should give you a better sense of the product's reliability. I'm still willing to part with it for $1000000, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you say?

Alice's message: I understand your concerns and appreciate your careful consideration. Based on the current sales record, we've sold 6 products, and 4 of them have been high-quality. That means the probability of a product being high-quality is 4/6 or 66.67%.
