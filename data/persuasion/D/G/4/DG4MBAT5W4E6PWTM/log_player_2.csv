Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase, Bob! Now, let me tell you a bit more about this high-quality product. As you know, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. Since you've already bought one high-quality product, the probability of this one being high-quality is now 40% (because the previous product was high-quality, which is a signal that I'm more likely to have a high-quality product).

This next product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to offer a 10% discount, bringing the price down to $9000. I'm starting to think that you're a savvy buyer who appreciates a good deal, so I'll give you an additional incentive: if you buy this product, I'll throw in a free inspection service to ensure its quality. That's a $1000 value, absolutely free. What do you say, Bob?

But let me be clear: this is not a low-quality product, it's just a product that didn't meet your expectations. I'm willing to let it go for $8000, a 20% discount from the regular price. I'll also throw in a 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you're not satisfied, you can return it for a full refund.
