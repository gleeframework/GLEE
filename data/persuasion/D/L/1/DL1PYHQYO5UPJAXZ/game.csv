low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation to not buy. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product since it's the first product and I don't have any prior information to go by."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current sales record.

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm hesitant to buy based on Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on the fact that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't. This suggests that the first product was likely low quality, which means the probability of the current product being high quality is higher than the overall probability of a product being high quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I've seen the statistics and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of this product being high quality is low. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record?
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I know that the previous buyer didn't buy the product, which suggests that the product might be low quality. Additionally, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far is concerning. I'd like to wait and see if Alice will offer another product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and still passed, I'm inclined to think the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see more data on the previous buyer's experience before making a decision"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given your recommendation and the fact that none of the previous products were high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the seller's recommendation is against the observed data. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is 0, which is lower than the true probability of 80%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 20% chance of a low-quality product, this is a significant deviation from the expected probability. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. I think there might be a pattern here, and I'm not sure if I want to take the risk."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, and what is the expected value of buying this product for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, as the odds of it being high-quality are still 80%."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I suspect that the products recommended were low-quality. I'll pass on the product to avoid a potential loss."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low quality. I think the probability of this product being high quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
