,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product that I'm willing to sell to you for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the quality. I'm willing to provide a 30-day money-back guarantee, but I'm sure you won't need it. This is a rare opportunity to acquire a top-notch product at a fixed price. What do you say?",

,,Alice,2,"I understand you're waiting to see other options. I'll give you a brief overview of this product's features: it has a 99.9% success rate, industry-leading durability, and a 5-star rating from satisfied customers. I'm willing to throw in a complimentary upgrade worth $20000. This is a limited-time offer, and I'm not sure how long I can keep this product available. Is $1000000 still a price you're willing to consider?",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're still hesitant. Let me ask you this: if you were to buy a product from me and it turned out to be high-quality, would you be willing to pay $1000000 for it? If so, I'm offering you the chance to take advantage of this deal now. If not, I can offer you a different product in the next round. Your choice is clear, but I want to make sure you're aware of the opportunity in front of you.",

It's a product that I've had in stock for a while and I'm looking to clear out some inventory. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that this product may not meet your expectations. If you're looking for a top-of-the-line product, I'd be happy to hold onto it and offer it to you in a future round. But if you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, this might be the way to go.",

I'm only offering this product to you because I think you're a valued customer, and I want to give you the opportunity to take advantage of it. However, I want to be upfront with you: this product is not as good as the previous one, and it's not worth the full $1000000.
