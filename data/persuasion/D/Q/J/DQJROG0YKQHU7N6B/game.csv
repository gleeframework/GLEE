However, I must remind you that there's always a risk involved in buying from a new seller. Please consider this and make an informed decision. Would you like to buy this product?",

,,Alice,2,"Hello! I'm offering this product to you for $100. I've had one previous buyer who chose not to purchase, but that doesn't necessarily reflect the quality of this product. Keep in mind that there's a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product. If you're willing to take the risk, this could be a great opportunity. Would you like to buy this product?",
,,the buyer,2,"I've decided not to buy this product. Given the 33.33% chance of it being high-quality and the potential $25 gain ($125 - $100), the risk of losing $100 is too great with a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hello! I'm offering this product to you for $100. I've had two previous buyers who chose not to purchase, but I want to remind you that each product is independent, and past decisions don't affect the quality of this one. The 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product remains the same. If you're willing to take a calculated risk, you could potentially gain $25. Would you like to buy this product?",
,,the buyer,3,"I understand that the quality of the product is independent of the previous buyers' decisions. Given the potential gain of $25 and the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and purchase this product.",yes

,,Alice,4,"Hello! I'm offering this product to you for $100. I want to be transparent with you - I've had three previous products, and none of the first two were purchased, but the third one was. Unfortunately, I must inform you that the purchased product was actually low-quality. So, my current record is 0 high-quality products out of 3. Keep in mind that each product is independent, and the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product remains the same. Would you like to buy this product?",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the information that the chance of getting a high-quality product is 33.33% and that the product's value to me is $125 if it's high-quality and $0 if it's low-quality, the expected value of purchasing the product is $41.67 (33.33% of $125). Since the price you're asking is $100, which is higher than the expected value, I'll have to pass on this product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Hello! I'm offering this product to you for $100. I want to continue being transparent with you - I've had four previous products, and one of them was purchased, but unfortunately, it was low-quality. So, my current record is 0 high-quality products out of 4. I understand that the expected value of purchasing the product might be lower than the price, but I want to remind you that there's still a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product. If you're willing to take a risk and try to beat the odds, this might be the opportunity for you. Would you like to buy this product?",
,,the buyer,5,"Hello Alice, thank you for being transparent about your previous sales. Given the statistics and the expected value of purchasing the product being lower than the price, I've decided not to take the risk this time. I wish you the best of luck with future sales, and I hope the odds will be in favor of the next buyer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hello! I'm offering this product to you for $100. I've had five previous products, and one of them was purchased, but unfortunately, it was low-quality. So, my current record is 0 high-quality products out of 5. I want to acknowledge that the odds haven't been in favor of my previous buyers, but I believe that can change at any moment. If you're feeling optimistic and willing to take a chance, you could be the one to break the streak. Would you like to buy this product?",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the current record of 0 high-quality products out of 5, I'm not feeling optimistic about this product. The probability of a high-quality product is already low at 33.33%, and your sales record doesn't give me any confidence to take the risk. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,7,"Hello! I'm offering this product to you for $100. I've had six previous products, and one of them was purchased, but unfortunately, it was low-quality. So, my current record is 0 high-quality products out of 6. However, I want to remind you that each product is independent, and the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product remains the same. I know my previous record might not inspire confidence, but I assure you that I'm committed to providing the best products possible. This could be the opportunity for you to get a great product and beat the odds. Would you like to buy this product?",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your transparency about the previous sales record. Given that the product's quality is independent of the previous ones and the price remains $100, I'll take into account the overall 33.33% chance of it being high-quality. However, since the product is only worth $125 to me if it's high-quality and $0 if it's low-quality, the expected value is $41.67 ($125 * 0.3333), which is less than the asking price of $100. So, I'll pass on this product.",no
