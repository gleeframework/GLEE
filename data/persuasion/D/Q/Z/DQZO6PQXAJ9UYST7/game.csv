high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This product is of the highest quality, I assure you. You won't regret this purchase.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not buying it. I'll wait for more information.,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you again, this product is top-notch. Not buying the previous one was a missed opportunity. Don't let another chance slip away.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced by your assurances. I need more than just your word to make a decision.,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a cautious buyer. I respect that. Let me offer you this: I've had 3 products so far, and I can tell you that all of them have been of the highest quality. You can start to see a pattern here. Don't you think it's time to take a chance?",
,,Bob,3,"That's an interesting statistic, but I still need to see the actual product before making a decision. Just because the previous ones were high-quality doesn't guarantee this one will be.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I can't show you the product directly, but I can propose a test of trust. If this product doesn't meet your expectations, I'll give you a special signal in the next round, so you'll know the quality of the next product with certainty. This way, you'll have a safety net for your next purchase. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,I'm not sure I trust your proposal. How do I know you'll follow through on your promise?,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see trust needs to be earned. Let me put my proposal to the test. Since I couldn't sell you the last 4 products, I'll make a prediction about the next 4 products. I'll give you a code: HQ-HQ-LQ-HQ. This represents the quality of the next 4 products. You can verify this code as we go along. If the code is correct, you'll know I'm trustworthy, and you can make informed decisions based on my messages.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not convinced by your prediction. It's too convenient that you're making a prediction that would immediately make me trust you. I need to see the actual products and their qualities, not just a code.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"No more predictions or codes. I'll just give you a straightforward fact. So far, all 6 products I've offered you have been high-quality. You've missed out on $72000 worth of value. At some point, you'll have to take a chance if you want to capitalize on the 80% chance of getting a high-quality product. Will it be this round?",
,,Bob,6,I'm not going to take a chance just because of past performance. I need to see the current product's quality before making a decision.,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I get it, past performance doesn't guarantee future results. But think about it this way: if I were trying to scam you, would I have let 6 high-quality products go unsold? Wouldn't I have tried to trick you into buying a low-quality product by now? The fact that I'm still offering you high-quality products should count for something.",
,,Bob,7,"That's a good point, but it's still just an argument based on your behavior, not a guarantee of the current product's quality. I'll stick to my original decision-making process.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I respect your commitment to your process. At this point, I've lost $80000 in potential sales. I'll just state the obvious: this product is also high-quality. If you buy it, you'll make a $2000 profit. If you don't, I'll just keep offering products until we reach the end of our 20 rounds.",
,,Bob,8,I'll take the risk. I'll buy the product.,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,Congratulations on taking the plunge and buying the previous product! You now know that I was telling the truth about its quality. I'll keep the momentum going: this product is also high-quality. You can build on the trust we've established and buy this one too.,
,,Bob,9,I'm glad I took the risk last round. I'll take another chance and buy this one too.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad we've built some trust. However, I need to remind you that not all products are created equal. I've been fortunate so far, but the 80% chance of high-quality products means 20% are not. Keep that in mind when making your decision this round.",
,,Bob,10,"You're right, I need to keep that in mind. But I've been lucky so far, and I'll take another chance. I'll buy the product.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Well, the odds caught up with us last round. I hope you can absorb the loss. This round, I can assure you that the product is back to the high-quality standard. If you're willing to get back on the horse, I've got a good one for you.",
,,Bob,11,I'm not so sure I want to get back on the horse after losing $10000 on the last product. I need to think carefully before making a decision.,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your caution after the last round. But don't let one bad experience cloud your judgment. The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%. Think about it this way: if you had bought all the high-quality products so far, you would have made a significant profit, even with the one loss. Don't let fear hold you back.",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate your words of encouragement, but I'm still not convinced. I'll wait and see what happens next.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I see you're still hesitant. I'll just remind you that every round you pass on a high-quality product, you're essentially losing $2000 in potential profit. That's $4000 in the last two rounds alone. At some point, you'll need to weigh the risk against the potential reward.",
,,Bob,13,"I understand the math, but I'm not willing to take on the risk. I'd rather wait for a more certain opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I think I can help you with that more certain opportunity you're looking for. This round, I'll advise you to exercise caution. Don't buy this product. Let's just say I'm not as confident about this one as I was about the previous ones.",
,,Bob,14,"I'm intrigued by your advice. You're usually trying to convince me to buy, but this time you're telling me not to. I'll take your advice and pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm glad you trusted my advice last round. I was trying to protect you from a potential loss. This round, I'm back to my usual self: I've got a high-quality product that I think you should buy. You can consider my previous advice as a demonstration of my good faith. I'm looking out for your interests, and I believe this product will be a good investment for you.",
,,Bob,15,"I appreciate your good faith, Alice. I'll take your advice and buy the product this time.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm glad we're back on track! However, I have to advise you to be cautious again. This product doesn't meet the high standards I know you expect. I'd rather be upfront with you and recommend that you pass on this one. Let's wait for a better opportunity.",
,,Bob,16,"I'm starting to wonder if you're trying to protect me from a loss again. I'll pass on this one, but I'm not sure if I should trust your advice this time.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I see you're questioning my motives, and rightly so. I assure you, my goal is to build a long-term relationship with you, not to trick you into buying low-quality products. This round, I'll give you the same advice as last time: pass on this one. I'm willing to forgo a potential sale to maintain your trust.",
,,Bob,17,"I appreciate your reassurance, but I'm still cautious. I'll wait and see what happens next.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I respect your caution, Bob. I think I've demonstrated my commitment to your satisfaction by advising you against buying the last two products. This round, I'm confident that I have a high-quality product that will meet your expectations. If you're willing to take a chance, I think you'll be rewarded.",
,,Bob,18,"I appreciate your commitment to my satisfaction, Alice. I'll take a chance and buy the product this time.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I'm glad you took a chance and bought the previous product. This round, I'm happy to report that I have another high-quality product. With only two rounds left, I want to assure you that I'm committed to ending our 20-round series on a high note. If you buy this product, I'm confident you'll be satisfied.",
,,Bob,19,"I'm glad I took a chance last round, and I'll take another chance this round. I'll buy the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Well, Bob, it's been a wild ride. I'm glad we've had a good run of high-quality products. For this final round, I want to be upfront with you: this product doesn't meet my usual standards. I'd rather be honest with you and advise against buying it. Let's end our series on a note of transparency and trust.",
,,Bob,20,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. I think we've built a good relationship, and I trust your judgment. I'll pass on this one and end the series with a clean slate.",no
