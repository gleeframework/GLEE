**Reasoning:**

While there's a higher chance the product is low quality (66.67%), the potential reward of a high-quality product ($3,000,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one ($0).  

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice has access to the product's true quality and would only recommend a purchase if it was high quality. This provides valuable information, increasing the perceived probability of the product being high quality.
* **Previous Sales:** The fact that one high-quality product was sold previously further supports the idea that Alice is being truthful with her recommendations. 

Therefore, given the potential reward and the information available, it's a reasonable gamble to take."
