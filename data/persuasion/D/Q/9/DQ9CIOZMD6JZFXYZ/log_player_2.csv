"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'm not sure if it's worth the risk, given the odds.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product has a 66.67% chance of being low quality and is worth $0 to you, it's not worth the risk of buying it, even if Alice recommends it. It's better to pass and see what happens in the next round."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $400 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm still hesitant. I need to see more evidence before I'm willing to take a chance.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the previous product was high-quality, the odds are still heavily against you. There's a much higher chance of getting a low-quality product, making it not worth the risk. It's important to remember that Alice doesn't know the true value of the products to you."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm still not convinced.  While I appreciate the offer, I need to see more evidence of the quality of your products before I'm willing to buy.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Despite two consecutive high-quality products being missed, the odds are still heavily skewed towards low-quality products. It's important to play the long game and stick to the strategy of only buying when the odds are clearly in your favor. Continuing to pass builds a stronger position for future rounds."

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information. I'll pass on this one. I'm still waiting for a better opportunity.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice not recommending the product is a significant change. While it doesn't guarantee the product is low quality, it does mean it's not as promising as one she would recommend. Considering the past rounds, where all the recommended products were high-quality, it's reasonable to assume Alice is trying to get rid of a low-quality product. It's best to wait for a more favorable situation."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice continues not recommending the product, confirming that it might be a low-quality product. While there's always a chance of a high-quality product, sticking with the strategy of buying only when there's clear evidence of quality is crucial.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now not recommended three products in a row, further solidifying the assumption that she's trying to get rid of low-quality ones. It's important to maintain the strategy of only buying when there's a clear indication of high quality. The game is still young, and there are better opportunities to come."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has not recommended a product for four rounds consecutively. This strongly suggests that she is attempting to sell low-quality products, and continuing to pass is the best strategy.

```

**Explanation:**
