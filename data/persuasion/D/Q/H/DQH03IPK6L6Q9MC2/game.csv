,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism. Let me sweeten the deal. I'll throw in a unique feature that's not available on any other product like this. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.",
,,Bob,6,I'm not convinced by the 'unique feature' and I'm not willing to pay $1500000 for a high-quality product. I'm going to pass on this offer.,no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've been thinking about our previous transactions, and I realize I may have been a bit too optimistic about the value of my products. This low-quality product is actually a great opportunity for you to practice your negotiation skills. I'm willing to sell it to you for... nothing. Yes, you heard that right, $0. It's a loss for me, but I'm willing to take the hit if it means you'll be happy.",

If you can answer a simple question correctly, I'll give it to you for $0. If you answer incorrectly, you still get to keep the product, but you have to pay the full $1000000. Are you up for the challenge?",
,,Bob,9,I'll take the challenge! What's the question?,yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"The question is: What is the probability that the product I'm offering you in this round is high-quality? If you answer correctly, you get the product for $0. If you answer incorrectly, you have to pay the full $1000000. Think carefully before making your decision.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not going to fall for this trick. I know the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, so I'll answer incorrectly to avoid paying the full $1000000.",no

,,Alice,11,"I see you're a savvy buyer! I'll give you a straightforward offer. This low-quality product is still worth something to me, and I'm willing to let it go for $50000. It's a small price to pay for getting rid of it, and I'm hoping you'll take it off my hands.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I'm glad we could end on a positive note too, Bob. But, I have to admit, I'm a bit surprised you're still buying products from me.

No charge, no strings attached.",
