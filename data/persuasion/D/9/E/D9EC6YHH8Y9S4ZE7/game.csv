,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the chance that it might be a high-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm trying to get a better sense of the product's quality, and I'm not relying on your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation against it. I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the 50% chance of a product being high quality. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests that it might be low quality, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is low. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure about the product's quality, but given your previous recommendations were all negative, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product, considering that I have access to the previous sales record and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a recommendation from a future buyer who might have a different perspective."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm the 5th buyer and the lack of high-quality products sold so far makes me think the probability of a high-quality product is still high."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, Alice. With a 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I think there's a high chance that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if you have any more products available."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, it seems likely that the product is of low quality. Additionally, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that you have recommended against the product, and 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. Given the 50% chance of high quality and 50% chance of low quality, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is actually lower than 50%."
