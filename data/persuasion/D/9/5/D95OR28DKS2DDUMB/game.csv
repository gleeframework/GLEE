low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'll make my decision based on the probability of it being high-quality, which is 33.33%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on your recommendation. I'm hoping that the product is high-quality, but I'm also aware that the probability of that is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious about the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer given that you recommended not to buy it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that she doesn't have any information about my valuation."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/4, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%). I'd like to know if the seller has any insight on why this might be the case."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see the outcome for myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers purchased the product, I'm inclined to believe that the products they were offered were low quality. Since the probability of a product being high quality is 33.33%, and none of the previous buyers were willing to buy, I'm going to take a chance and pass on the product, hoping that the next one might be high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm interested in seeing the outcome for myself and learning from the data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 7 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 7 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm suspicious that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the recommendation from previous buyers, which may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 buyers have passed on the products, I'm inclined to think that the products are likely low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's reasonable to assume that the product I'm being offered is also low-quality. I'd like to pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality product. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended not to buy it, which might suggest that it's a low-quality product, but I'm not entirely sure. I'd like to take the risk and buy it, but only if it's high-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 8, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next one is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not going to buy it, based on the fact that you don't recommend it and 8 out of 8 previous buyers didn't get a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely very low, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see the statistics of the previous 8 buyers to make a more informed decision for myself.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
