,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious, can you tell me why you're not recommending it? Is it because of the previous buyer's experience?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer also passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, and I'll get a good deal."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation.

I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low sales record of high-quality products, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, and considering the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to ask, how many total products have been sold so far?"

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the probability of a high-quality product being offered, which is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. Your lack of recommendation suggests that the product is likely low quality, which means I can buy it for $10000 and then discard it, effectively getting a free product. I'm not expecting to get any value out of it, but it's a low-risk way to play the game."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Is it 0/6?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is likely due to the low number of high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is higher than the overall probability.
