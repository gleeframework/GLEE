We're just starting out, and we're not sure what the quality of this product is. But we're confident that we'll have some high-quality products available soon. If you're interested, this could be a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor!

Alice's message: Welcome! We appreciate your interest in our product. We've sold 1 product so far, and it was a low-quality one. This means that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. However, we'd like to point out that the law of large numbers suggests that as we sell more products, the proportion of high-quality products should converge to the true probability. We're not saying you should buy or not, but we thought it was worth mentioning.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on this one. Given the current statistics, I think it's too early to make a decision based on the law of large numbers. I'd like to wait and see the outcome of the next few sales before making a decision.""

Alice's message: We've sold 2 products so far, with 1 being high-quality. This means that the proportion of high-quality products is 50%, which is higher than the initial 33.33%. We're not sure what this means, but it's worth noting. The price remains $1000000. If you're interested, this could be a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price... or it could just be a coincidence. The choice is yours.
