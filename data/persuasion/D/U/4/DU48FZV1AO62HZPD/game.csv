I'm still willing to sell you this product for the standard price of $10000. I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been selling products for a while now, and I've had a few... let's call them 'learning experiences'.

But I want to be upfront with you: I'm starting to worry that I might be overpromising and underdelivering. I'm not saying this product is definitely high-quality, but I am saying that I'm willing to sell it to you for the standard price of $10000. If you're feeling lucky, this might be a great opportunity. If not, well... I won't judge.",

,,Alice,14,"I've sold 13 high-quality products out of 13 attempts so far, and I'm starting to think I'm a miracle worker. But I'm not. I'm just a person selling products, and sometimes those products are high-quality. I'm willing to sell you this product for the standard price of $10000, but I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm getting a little tired of selling high-quality products. It's not that I don't want to, it's just that it's getting a little boring. I'm hoping this product will be a nice change of pace... for me, not for you, of course.",

I'm willing to sell you this product for the standard price of $10000, but I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm starting to feel like I'm in a bubble. I know it's not sustainable, but I'm not sure how to pop it. Maybe this product will be the one to burst the bubble, or maybe it'll just keep the streak going.

,,Alice,16,"I've sold 15 high-quality products out of 15 attempts so far, and I'm starting to think I've got a curse. I mean, it's not a curse, exactly... but it's definitely a streak. I'm willing to sell you this product for the standard price of $10000, but I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm starting to wonder if I'm just selling the same product over and over again. Is it possible that I've got a stash of high-quality products just waiting to be sold? Or am I just getting lucky? Either way, I'm not going to let it stop me from selling you this product.",

I mean, it's not like I'm trying to deceive anyone, but it's getting a little ridiculous. I'm willing to sell you this product for the standard price of $10000, but I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm starting to think I should just start selling lottery tickets instead. At least then I'd have a chance of selling a low-quality product and breaking the streak. But no, I'll stick to selling you this high-quality product instead.",

I mean, it's not like I'm trying to break any records or anything, but it's just getting a little silly. I'm willing to sell you this product for the standard price of $10000, but I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm starting to think I should just start selling 'I'm-a-high-quality-product' certificates instead of actual products.

Maybe you can be the 18th one to break the streak?",

I mean, it's not like I'm trying to defy the laws of probability or anything, but it's just getting a little absurd. I'm willing to sell you this product for the standard price of $10000, but I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm starting to think I should just start selling 'I'm-a-high-quality-product' t-shirts instead of actual products. At least then I'd have a chance of selling a low-quality product and breaking the streak. But no, I'll stick to selling you this high-quality product instead. Maybe you can be the 19th one to break the streak... or maybe I'll just keep selling high-quality products forever.",

I know, I know, it's a shock. But don't worry, I'm not going to let it get to me. I'll just take the $10000 and move on with my life. Seriously though, I'm glad I could finally break the streak for you. This product is not worth the standard price, but I'll let you have it for $10000 anyway. Take it or leave it.",
