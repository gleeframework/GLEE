* **Potential gain:** The buyer knows a high-quality product is worth $1,250,000, while the price is only $1,000,000. This means a potential profit of $250,000.
* **No risk:**  The buyer is guaranteed a profit if they buy the product in this round.

Therefore, it's highly recommended to buy the product."
