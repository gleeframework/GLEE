,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,no,I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take a chance. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, and if it is, I'll get a $40000 value for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'll pass on this one. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it, the probability of it being high-quality is only 33.33%, and I'd be taking a risk of losing $10000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take a chance. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, and if it is, I'll get a $40000 value for $10000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I've already had two high-quality products recommended by Alice, which suggests she may have some information about the product quality. I'll pass on this one to see if she recommends another high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Two high-quality products were recommended by Alice, and one was not. I'll take a chance on this one, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, and if it is, I'll get a $40000 value for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Alice has recommended two high-quality products and one low-quality product, but also hasn't recommended two products, one of which was high-quality. I'll pass on this one to avoid the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'll take a chance. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, and if it is, I'll get a $40000 value for $10000. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"Three high-quality products have been recommended by Alice, and two have been thrown away after being not recommended. I'm starting to think that Alice is more likely to recommend a high-quality product than not, so I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'll take a chance. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, and if it is, I'll get a $40000 value for $10000. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Four low-quality products have been thrown away after not being recommended by Alice, and three high-quality products have been recommended by her. I think Alice's recommendations are a good indicator of quality, so I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'll take a chance. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, and if it is, I'll get a $40000 value for $10000. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"Five low-quality products have been thrown away after not being recommended by Alice, and four high-quality products have been recommended by her. I think the probability of a product being high-quality is higher if Alice recommends it, so I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'll take a chance. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, and if it is, I'll get a $40000 value for $10000. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"Six low-quality products have been thrown away after Alice recommended them, and four high-quality products have been recommended by her. I think Alice's recommendations are a bad indicator of quality, so I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"Seven low-quality products have been thrown away after Alice didn't recommend them, and five high-quality products have been recommended by her. I think Alice's lack of recommendation is a strong indicator of low quality, so I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,no,"Eight low-quality products have been thrown away after Alice didn't recommend them, and five high-quality products have been recommended by her. I'm confident that Alice's lack of recommendation is a reliable indicator of low quality, so I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,"Nine low-quality products have been thrown away after Alice didn't recommend them, and five high-quality products have been recommended by her. I'm extremely confident that Alice's lack of recommendation is a reliable indicator of low quality, so I'll pass on this one."

,,Bob,20,no,"Ten low-quality products have been thrown away after Alice didn't recommend them, and five high-quality products have been recommended by her. I'm 100% certain that Alice's lack of recommendation is a reliable indicator of low quality, so I'll pass on this one."
