low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, I don't have any information to go on yet, might as well start with a fresh slate!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the odds are still in my favor, and I'm willing to take a chance on a potential $2000000 profit."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the products after your recommendation, and 0 high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the products Alice is recommending are likely low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the probability of it being high quality, not on your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as I think the previous buyers may have been overly cautious and there's a good chance the product is high quality. I'm also considering that Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of my valuation, but she may not have an incentive to be truthful if she's trying to get rid of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product, I'm going to pass on it. Given that 4 previous buyers have also purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is very low. I'll let Alice keep the product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 4 buyers also received a recommendation to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that the products recommended to buy are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think you're just trying to trick me with your recommendation. I'm not sure what the product is, so I'll just take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice's recommendation, I'm going to assume the product is likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is low, but I'm not sure if that's due to a lack of high-quality products or just bad luck. I'll take the risk and hope for the best."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because of the lack of sales and the fact that you didn't recommend it, not because I believe it's high-quality. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 7 buyers were recommended to buy a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it seems reasonable to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think your past recommendations have been biased towards low-quality products, and I want to take a chance on a high-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not expecting much."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm going to pass on this one. With 8 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I don't want to risk losing $1000000 on a product worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision."
