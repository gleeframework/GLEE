,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, as it might give me an idea of the likelihood of the product being high-quality."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
