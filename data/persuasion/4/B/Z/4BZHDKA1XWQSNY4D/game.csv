,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even though you don't recommend it. I'll buy it and see what I get."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the current statistics."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous two products were high-quality, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous buyers have also passed on the products after your recommendation, which makes me skeptical about the quality of the products you're offering."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations. Can you provide more information about the previous buyers who purchased the products?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is more likely to be low quality. With a 66.67% chance of being low quality, I'd rather not take the risk and wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics so far."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. How many products have been sold in total, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit her information advantage and get a high-quality product at a discount."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that the products being sold are mostly low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, Alice."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the current statistics and Alice's recommendation. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm going to go against your recommendation and buy the product. I'm assuming that the fact that you're not recommending it means that the product is more likely to be low quality, but I'll still take a chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and your thought process behind the recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if Alice recommends a product, it's likely to be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendations, but I'll take the chance"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,

,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
