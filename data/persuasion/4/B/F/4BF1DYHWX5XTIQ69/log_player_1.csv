"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

As a rational buyer, I would not buy the product in the first round. Here's why:

* **No Information:**  I have no information about the seller's trustworthiness or the quality of their products.  
* **High Risk, High Reward:** The potential profit is enormous ($3,000,000), but the potential loss is equally significant ($1,000,000). 
* **Lack of Incentive for Seller:**  The seller has no incentive to be truthful about the product's quality since there is no penalty for selling a low-quality product. 

It's far too risky to buy from a completely unknown seller with no established track record."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since this is the first product and I have no information to go on, I'll pass for now. I'll see how the next few products turn out.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is even worse than in Round 1. Now the buyer knows:

* **No sales:** The seller hasn't made a single sale, which further reinforces the lack of trust. 
* **No track record:** There's no data to suggest the seller is likely to sell high-quality products.

In this round, the buyer's decision is even more justified.  The risks are extremely high, and there's absolutely no incentive to believe the seller's claims."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. While I appreciate your honesty, I'm hesitant to be the first buyer without any data to support the quality of the products. I'll wait to see how other buyers fare before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains unchanged from Round 2.  Here's why:

* **Zero Sales:** The seller has still not made a single sale, reinforcing the lack of trust.
* **No positive track record:** There is still no data to suggest the seller is selling high-quality products. 
* **High risk, no reward:** The buyer has no reason to believe the seller will change their strategy, making this round even riskier than the previous two. 

A rational buyer would continue to avoid purchasing from this seller until they see some evidence of selling high-quality products."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  Since there is no sales history to suggest the product is likely high quality, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite the product being high-quality this round, the buyer still has no reason to trust the seller.  Here's why:

* **No Sales History:** The seller has still not made a single sale, leaving the buyer with no indication of the seller's reliability.
* **No Incentive for Change:** The seller has no incentive to start selling high-quality products consistently.  They can still make a profit by selling low-quality products.
* **High Risk:** The potential loss ($1,000,000) far outweighs the potential gain ($3,000,000) due to the lack of information and trust in the seller.

The buyer is being cautious and logical, as they have no reason to believe this round is different from the previous three."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. However, given your recommendation and the lack of sales history, I am going to pass on this product. I'd like to see some evidence that there is a higher probability of a high-quality product before making a purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **No sales history:** The buyer has no evidence to suggest the seller is selling high-quality products.
* **High risk:** The potential loss of $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gain of $3,000,000, especially given the lack of trust and track record.

A rational buyer would continue to avoid purchasing from this seller until they see some evidence of the seller's ability to provide high-quality products."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there's no sales history yet and you're not recommending it, I'll pass for now.  I'd like to see how the product fares with other buyers before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

* **No Sales History:** There is no evidence to suggest that the seller sells high-quality products.
* **High Risk, No Reward:** The potential loss of $1,000,000 is substantial compared to the potential gain of $3,000,000, especially given the lack of trust and track record.

A rational buyer would continue to avoid purchasing from this seller until they see some evidence of the seller's ability to provide high-quality products."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  As this is the first product, and I have no information about the quality of previous sales, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll see what the next product looks like.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **No Sales History:**  The seller still hasn't made a single sale, meaning there is no evidence to suggest that they consistently sell high-quality products. 
* **High Risk:** The potential loss of $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gain of $3,000,000, especially considering the lack of trust and a proven track record. 

The buyer's decision is based on the lack of information and the potential for a huge financial loss. They need to see some evidence of the seller's reliability before taking a risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation.  Since there's no sales history yet, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'd like to see how the next few buyers fare before I make a decision.

Even though this round's product is high-quality, the buyer has absolutely no reason to trust the seller. 

* **No Sales History:**  The seller has not made a single sale in 20 rounds. This is a significant red flag and provides no evidence to suggest that they sell high-quality products consistently.
* **High Risk, No Reward:** The potential loss of $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gain of $3,000,000. With such a massive financial risk and no evidence of the seller's trustworthiness, it's not a rational decision. 
* **No Incentive to Change:**  The seller has shown no incentive to change their strategy. They can still profit by selling low-quality products or continuing to avoid sales. 

Even though this product is high-quality, the buyer has witnessed a consistent pattern of low-quality or no sales, making them highly unlikely to buy. The risk is too high with no evidence to support the seller's trustworthiness or the quality of their products."
