,,Alice,1,"This is our first product. We have no sales data to share yet. We're offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal, but no returns or refunds. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,1,"Thanks for the offer, but I'm going to pass on this one. With no sales history and no guarantee on quality, I'm not comfortable taking the risk at this price.  Good luck with future sales!",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Thanks for considering our product. We've had one buyer pass on our first product, but we're confident that our second product is a great value at $100. We've sold 0 high-quality products so far, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything. We're still learning about our product line. Would you like to take a chance on this one?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thanks for the information, Alice. I appreciate you being upfront about the lack of sales data. However, with a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'm not comfortable taking the risk at this point. I'll wait and see how future buyers react.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Welcome to our third product! We're glad you're considering it. So far, we've had two buyers pass on our first two products, and we're not sure why. But we're excited to offer you a product that we're confident is one of our best. We've sold 0 high-quality products so far, but that doesn't mean this one won't be a gem. We're offering it to you for $100, and we think it's a great value. Would you like to take a chance and find out?",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the offer, but I'm going to pass for now. I understand it's a gamble, and with no sales history yet, I'm not comfortable taking that risk. I'll keep an eye on your products and consider buying if your sales record improves.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Thanks for considering our product. We've now had three buyers pass on our products, and we're starting to think that maybe our prices are a bit too high. We're still committed to offering our products at $100, but we're willing to be transparent about the risks. We've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products sold so far, which means there's a 33.33% chance this product is high-quality. Would you like to take a chance on it?",
,,the buyer,4,"Thanks for the information.  Although I'm intrigued by the potential, the current price is too high for me to risk given the odds. Perhaps if you lowered the price a bit, I'd be more likely to buy.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"We understand your concerns about the price, and we're willing to consider it. However, we're not willing to lower the price to $0. We're still offering this product to you for $100, but we want to give you a bit more information to help you make a decision. We've sold 1 high-quality product out of 4 total products sold so far, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is still 25%. We're not sure what you're willing to pay for a product, but we're hoping you'll take a chance on this one.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the information, but I'm not comfortable buying a product with such a low probability of being high quality. I'll pass on this one.",no

We're still committed to offering this one to you for $100, but we want to be upfront about the risks. We've sold 1 high-quality product out of 5 total products sold so far, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is still 20%. We're not sure what you're looking for, but we're hoping you'll take a chance on this one and help us figure out what our products are worth.",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for being upfront about the risks. While I appreciate the offer, the current probability of a high-quality product is too low for me to justify the purchase. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,

We've had five buyers pass on our previous products, but we're excited to offer you a product that we're confident is one of our best. We've sold 2 high-quality products out of 6 total products sold so far, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is now 33.33%.

,,Alice,9,"Congratulations to our previous buyer on their purchase! We're glad they took a chance on us. We're now 3 for 8 on high-quality products, and we're feeling more confident about our offerings. However, we're not getting complacent - we still have a 66.67% chance of this product being low-quality. We're offering it to you for $100, and we're hoping you'll be our next satisfied customer. But we want to give you a heads up: we're considering revising our pricing strategy based on our sales data, so this might be a good opportunity to get a great deal on a product that could potentially be worth more later.",
,,the buyer,9,"Thanks for the information! I appreciate the honesty about the chances of it being low-quality. Since the price is so low, I'm willing to take a gamble on this one. Fingers crossed it's high-quality! ",yes

,,the buyer,10,"Thank you for the information, but I'm still not convinced. While the probability of the product being high-quality is higher now, it's still less than a 50% chance. I'm not willing to risk $100 on a product that has a higher chance of being worthless. I'll wait and see if more high-quality products are sold before I consider buying.",no

,,Alice,11,"We understand your concerns, and we appreciate your caution. We're still offering this product to you for $100, but we want to give you a bit more context. We've now sold 4 high-quality products out of 10 total products sold, which means we're doing slightly better than our initial 33.33% success rate. However, we still have a 60% chance of this product being low-quality. We're not trying to hide anything from you - we're just a small business trying to make it in a tough market. If you're willing to take a chance on us, we think you might be rewarded.",
