"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As a rational seller, you want to maximize your profits.  Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and you've only sold one product so far, there's no information to suggest this product is anything other than the expected 50% chance of being high-quality.  

Given the potential for a high-quality product and the price, it's a gamble worth taking for the buyer."

* **Reputation Risk:**  Recommending a low-quality product now would damage your reputation and make it much harder to sell future products.

**The best strategy:**

* **Don't recommend the purchase:**  It's best to be honest with the buyer. Even if you're not explicitly saying the product is low-quality, it's better to not recommend it. 
* **Offer an alternative:** You could offer to show them the product first or provide a discount if they're willing to take a risk. 
* **Build trust for the future:** By being honest, you maintain your reputation and can continue to sell high-quality products in the future."
