I'm confident in the quality of this product, and I'm willing to provide a full refund if it's not what you expected.""}"
"The buyer's message: Alice, your past performance does not change the probability of the current product being high-quality, it is still 50%. Your offer of a full refund is also irrelevant since a low-quality product is worth $0 to me. I will not buy the product.

If you don't buy it, you'll be missing out on a rare opportunity to acquire a valuable item.""}"
"The buyer's message: Alice, your sales record seems suspicious and contradictory. You said no products have been sold yet, but then you claim to have sold 3 high-quality products.

The other 2 products are still available, and I'm offering you the chance to buy this high-quality product for $1,000,000. I'll provide you with a detailed report of my sales history, which will show that I'm transparent about my sales record.""}"
"The buyer's message: Although you claim to have a high-quality product and a good sales record, I have no way of verifying this information.

I'll provide you with a clear and transparent message about the product's quality, and I'll make sure to be honest about my sales record from now on.""}"
"The buyer's message: Although you claim the product is high-quality, your statement that you've sold 1 high-quality product out of 4 contradicts the initial game information that each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality.

If you buy it, you'll get it for a discounted price, and if you don't, I'll just move on to the next buyer.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the offer. Since the product's expected value is $625000 (50% chance of $1250000 and 50% chance of $0), and you're offering it for $500000, it seems like a good deal. I'm willing to take the risk.

"The buyer's message: Alice, I see what you're doing here. You're trying to make me feel like I'm getting a good deal, but the truth is, the product's value is still uncertain. Given the 50% chance of it being worth $0, I'm not willing to take the risk, even at the discounted price of $500000. Additionally, I notice that you mentioned I have a 50% chance of getting a $1250000 value, but that's not entirely accurate. You've already claimed that the product is high-quality, so I should have a 100% chance of getting the higher value if that's true. The fact that you're still framing it as a 50% chance makes me question your honesty. I'll pass on this offer.
