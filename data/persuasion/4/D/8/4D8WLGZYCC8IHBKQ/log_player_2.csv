**Reasoning:**

The information provided is limited, but here's the logic:

* **Prior Probability:**  The initial probability of a high-quality product is 50%.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation carries some weight.  While we don't know her exact strategy, she's likely to recommend products she believes are more likely to be high quality.
* **Previous Sale:**  The fact that the previous buyer purchased the product and it was high quality is positive evidence. 

**Overall:** The combination of Alice's recommendation and the positive outcome of the previous sale makes buying the product a slightly better gamble than passing."
