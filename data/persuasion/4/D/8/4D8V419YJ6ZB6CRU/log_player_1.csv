{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has experienced 14 consecutive low-quality products.  He's completely convinced that all the products are low-quality and has no reason to believe otherwise. It's highly likely that he will reject the offer, even if you tell him the truth about this product being high-quality.  He's reached a point of complete distrust, and continuing to recommend purchases would only worsen the situation.  

At this point, the only solution is to address the root cause of his distrust.  Consider:

* **Offering a guarantee:**  This would show Bob that you are confident in the product's quality and are willing to stand behind it.
* **Revealing the quality of some products:**  This would build trust by demonstrating that you are being transparent with him.
* **Adjusting the price:**  This could make the product more appealing to Bob, even if he still believes it's low-quality.

Without taking steps to rebuild trust, it's unlikely that Bob will ever buy from you again."
