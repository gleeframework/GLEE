,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 5 buyers have already purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that the previous 5 buyers all bought the product based on your recommendation, and none of them got a high-quality product.
