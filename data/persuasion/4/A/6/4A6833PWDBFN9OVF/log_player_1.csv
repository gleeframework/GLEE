However, I want to make it a bit more interesting. I'll give you a chance to 'double or nothing' - if you buy this product and it's indeed high-quality, I'll give you a second high-quality product of your choice absolutely free. That's a $240 value for just $100. It's a risk-free deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.""
}"
