high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I think Alice is trying to sell me a low-quality product, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the remaining products are likely to be low-quality as well. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy, but none of the products were high quality. This suggests that the products being recommended may be low quality. I'd like to wait for a product that hasn't been recommended yet."

,,Alice,17,no,
