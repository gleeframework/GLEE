"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** The product is confirmed to be high-quality in this round.
* **Buyer's perspective:** The buyer knows the product is high-quality 80% of the time. Even with no information about this specific product, the expected value of buying is 0.8 * $3,000,000 = $2,400,000, which is significantly higher than the price of $1,000,000.

Therefore, it is highly recommended to buy the product in this round."

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-quality product:**  This round's product is low-quality.
* **Buyer's perspective:** The buyer has no information about the product's quality other than the general 80% chance of it being high-quality. However, the buyer now knows that you sold one product before and it was high-quality. This might make the buyer slightly more likely to trust your recommendation. However, the potential for loss is still very high. The buyer is still only willing to pay $1,000,000 while a low-quality product is worth $0. This is a risk the buyer should not take. 

Therefore, it is not recommended to buy the product in this round."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice.  While I appreciate your honesty, I'm going to pass on this one. I'm a bit hesitant to buy without more information, especially since you're not recommending it.  Perhaps I'll see what the next product looks like.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** This round's product is confirmed to be high-quality. 
* **Buyer's perspective:** The buyer now knows that you have sold two products: one high-quality and one low-quality. This information will likely make them more hesitant to buy. However, the expected value of buying is still positive. There's an 80% chance of getting a $3,000,000 product for $1,000,000.

Even with the added uncertainty, the potential reward outweighs the risk for the buyer.  Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product in this round."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'm willing to take a chance on this product.
The buyer bought the product!

* **Buyer's perspective:**  The buyer now knows that you have sold three products: two high-quality and one low-quality.

Even with the history of previous sales, the risk of losing $1,000,000 is too high. Therefore, it is not recommended to buy the product in this round."
