,,Alice,4,"Congratulations on taking the leap and purchasing our product! I'm glad you're willing to take a calculated risk. As for our next product, I'd like to assure you that we're committed to transparency. Since you're aware of the 80% chance of high-quality products, I'd like to highlight that our sales record is still strong, with 2 out of 3 products being high-quality. However, I must admit that our last product was low-quality. Considering this, I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to own this product at the same price of $10000.
