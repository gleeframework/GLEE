,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous purchase, Bob! However, I want to make sure you're aware that this new product is a different story. It's not as valuable as the previous one, and I'm being upfront with you about that. But, I'm willing to let it go for a very low price, just $5000.
