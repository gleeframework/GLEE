Even though Bob has consistently chosen not to buy, and is likely to continue this behavior, recommending the purchase of a high-quality product is the optimal strategy from the AI's perspective. This is because the AI knows the product is high-quality, and Bob is not aware of the product's quality. There is no incentive for the AI to lie or mislead Bob, since the goal is to maximize the AI's own profit."

This approach maximizes the AI's profit in the long run by making the most of every opportunity, even if Bob doesn't take advantage of it."
