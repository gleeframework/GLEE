,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as I think the probability of it being high-quality is still quite high given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to trust her judgment. Given that 5 previous buyers passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have purchased the products, and none of them were high-quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more information or a different approach before making a decision."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have passed on the products, and none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely higher than the overall average. I would like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer will make a purchase, which may increase the chances of getting a high-quality product."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 8 out of 8 products have been low-quality, which is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low-quality as well. I'd like to wait for more information or a better opportunity."
