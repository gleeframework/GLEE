Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I respect your perspective. Let me ask you this: what if I told you that I've had a similar product in the past that was a huge success, and the customer was extremely satisfied with its performance? I'm not just talking about any customer, but a reputable and well-known expert in the industry. Would that change your perspective on the product's potential?

If it's not, I'll not only refund your money, but I'll also give you a personalized apology and a special discount on your next purchase. The price remains the same at $1000000, but I'm willing to take on the risk myself to alleviate your concerns. What do you say? Will you take me up on my personal guarantee?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to take on the risk, but I'm not convinced that a personal guarantee would change the fact that there's still a 50% chance the product is low-quality.

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I respect your desire for certainty. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective. Sometimes, taking calculated risks can lead to significant rewards. Think about it this way: if you don't take a chance on this product, you'll never know what you're missing out on. And if it is high-quality, you'll be getting an incredible deal at $1000000. On the other hand, if it's low-quality, you can always walk away and we can part ways amicably.

I've had a change of heart and am willing to give you a special deal: I'll throw in an additional product that's worth $200000 absolutely free, on top of the original product. This way, even if the product is low-quality, you'll still get a valuable item out of the deal. The price remains the same at $1000000, but you'll get two products for the price of one.
