,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have purchased products and none of them were high-quality. Given the 50/50 chance of a product being high or low quality, I think it's likely that the remaining products are also low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious about Alice's logic behind not recommending it. Is it because of the lack of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already passed on the products and none have been high quality, I suspect that the remaining products are more likely to be low quality. I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered."

I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products improves."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
