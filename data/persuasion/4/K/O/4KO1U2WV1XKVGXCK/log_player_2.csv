**Reasoning:**

* **High Sales Rate:**  2 out of 2 products sold so far were high quality. This is a 100% success rate, significantly higher than the 33.33% probability of getting a high-quality product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  While Alice's recommendation alone isn't foolproof, the fact that she's recommending the product in the context of such a strong sales record increases the likelihood of a high-quality product.
* **Potential Loss:** Passing on the product means missing out on a potentially high-value product. The risk of getting a low-quality product is outweighed by the potential reward. 

**Important Note:** While this approach seems logical, it's crucial to remember that this is still a gamble. Alice's recommendations could be inaccurate or even manipulated, and the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product remains a significant risk."
