,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is 0.00%, which is lower than the prior probability of 80.00%. This suggests that the current product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold increases."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation based on the statistics.
