,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000.

This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you say?",

,,Alice,4,"I understand you're being cautious. Let me offer you a 'value proposition'. This product, although not as valuable as the previous one, still has some utility. I'm willing to sell it to you for $600000, which is a significant discount from its 'true value'. I'm not revealing what that value is, but I assure you it's lower than $1000000. If you buy it, you'll get it for a steal. What do you say?",

But, I'll also throw in a 'bonus'. If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at a fixed price of $800000, regardless of its quality. What do you say?",
