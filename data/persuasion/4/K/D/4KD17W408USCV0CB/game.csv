low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, I'm curious to see its quality and set the bar for future buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think it's possible that Alice's recommendation is based on a low-quality product and I don't want to pass up the chance to get a high-quality product. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics. Are you trying to hide something? 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 buyers suggests that the products you've been offering are low-quality. I'm not sure I want to take the risk.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation and the fact that none of the previous products sold were high quality. I'm not convinced that this product is worth the $100, given the low success rate so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales and the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure why you're not recommending it. Can you explain?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the previous sales data. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers bought the product and none of the products sold were high quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the current product being high quality is higher than 50%."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5 purchases, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when I know it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it seems that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product, I suspect that the previous products were all low-quality. I'm going to pass on this product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests that it might be a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's not worth $200 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product since the previous 5 buyers didn't buy it."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the fact that 6 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this one. The probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, and I don't want to be the one who ends up buying the only high-quality product, especially if the previous buyers have already passed on it."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of 6 attempts, I think it's more likely that the product is low quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products were sold. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product at a good price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 7 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that the products are mostly low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
