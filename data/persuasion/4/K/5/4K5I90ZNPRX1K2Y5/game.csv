,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first deal! This product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. However, I want to make it clear that I've had to adjust my pricing strategy after the first sale. This product is a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm not sure if I can offer it at this price again. If you don't take it, I'll have to consider offering it to a competitor for a lower price. What do you think?",
