"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Alice doesn't know Bob's valuation, there's a chance Bob values it higher than $10,000. Recommending the purchase gives Bob the opportunity to potentially make a good deal.  It's better to recommend the purchase than not, as Bob has no information to go on otherwise."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob bought the previous high-quality product, we still don't know his valuation for high-quality items. It's possible he values them much higher than $10,000, making this another potential good deal. Recommending the purchase is still the best strategy in this scenario."
"Bob's message: Thanks again, Alice! I'm feeling lucky.  I'll take another one.

This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We know Bob is willing to buy high-quality products at $10,000, but we don't know his valuation of low-quality products. Since there's a chance he values low-quality products less than $10,000, it's not advisable to recommend the purchase. We should avoid recommending the purchase of low-quality products, as it could potentially lead to Bob having a negative experience."
"Bob's message: I appreciate the heads-up, Alice.  I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob passed on the previous low-quality product, we still don't know his exact valuation for low-quality items. It's still possible he values them less than $10,000. It's always safer to recommend the purchase of high-quality products and avoid recommending low-quality ones to avoid potential negative experiences for Bob."

```

**Explanation:**

Since there's a chance he values them less than $10,000, recommending the purchase would be risky. We should continue to avoid recommending low-quality products to prevent potential negative experiences for Bob."

It's safer to err on the side of caution and only recommend high-quality products."
