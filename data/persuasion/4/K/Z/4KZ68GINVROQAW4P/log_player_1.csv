Think about it this way: even if this product isn't the best, the premium service alone is worth $50. So, you're essentially getting a $50 value for free, regardless of the product's quality.

You can use it to get a discount on your next high-quality product, or even on a future low-quality product if you want to take the risk again. What do you say?""
