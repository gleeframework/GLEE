low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance on the first product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product's quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious to see if Alice's recommendation was accurate or not. I'm not relying on her recommendation for my decision, but rather my own probability assessment."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality product sales so far, but I'm not convinced that this is a reliable indicator of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the statistics or do you have some other reason?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous buyers have seen 0 high-quality products sold, which suggests that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that I might end up with a low-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as you don't recommend it and 6 out of 6 previous buyers also didn't find it valuable enough to buy it. This suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products being sold, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting my $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me what led you to advise me to pass? Is it based on the past sales record or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low-quality product probability is higher than the high-quality product probability based on the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm starting to suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 7 buyers before me and no high-quality products sold, it seems the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 33.33%. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has been recommending low-quality products to the previous 7 buyers. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, it's likely that this product is also low quality. I'll pass on it to avoid wasting $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the information that the previous 7 buyers all passed on the product, which suggests that they might have seen low-quality products and decided not to buy. Given the high probability of low-quality products (66.67%), I'm hoping that this product might be high-quality and I'll get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered, considering the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product. I'd like to see the next product and its recommendation before making a decision."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm not sure I trust your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on Alice's lack of recommendation, I'm inclined to believe the product is likely low-quality. Given the high proportion of low-quality products sold so far (9/9), I'll pass on this one."
