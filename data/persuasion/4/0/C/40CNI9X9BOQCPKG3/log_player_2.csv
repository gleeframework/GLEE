**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows that 2 out of 2 products sold were high quality, indicating a 100% success rate for Alice's recommendations.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal that she believes the product is high quality. 
* **Potential Value:**  Even with a 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,000) outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0). 

**Important Note:**  While the sales record is encouraging, it's based on a small sample size.  As more data becomes available, the reliability of the sales record will increase."
