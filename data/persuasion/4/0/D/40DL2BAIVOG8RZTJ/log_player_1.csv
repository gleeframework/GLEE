  ""message"": ""I understand your skepticism, Bob. Let me give you some concrete data.

It's a one-time opportunity to get a great deal on a product that's still fully functional, even if it's not one of our top-tier models. Would you like to take it home and give it a try?""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure why the price is being discounted. If it's a high-quality product, I'd expect to pay the full price of $10000, not $8000. I'm going to pass on this one.

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{

Would you like to take a chance on it?""
}"

Would you like to take advantage of this incredible offer?""
}"

}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced that the second product is actually of equal or greater value.

}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure why you're offering a discount on a high-quality product. I've already paid $10000 for a similar product from the same batch, and I'm not sure if this one is worth the extra $500. I'm going to pass on this offer.

Would you like to consider adding it to your collection?""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a rare collectible item, even at a discounted price. I'm not a collector, and I don't see the value in owning a one-of-a-kind product that's not aligned with my interests.
