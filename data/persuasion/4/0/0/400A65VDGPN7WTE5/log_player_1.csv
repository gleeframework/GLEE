"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know the product is high-quality.  Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and you have no information about the buyer's individual valuation, it's in your best interest to recommend the purchase. 

Here's why:

* **High Probability of Profit:** There's an 80% chance the buyer values the high-quality product at more than $1,000,000, leading to a successful sale for you.
* **No Information to Suggest Otherwise:** You have no reason to believe the buyer wouldn't be interested in a high-quality product at this price, given the probability of high quality is known."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! Since this is the first product and there's no historical data to rely on, I'm willing to take a chance. I'll buy it!
The buyer bought the product!

**Explanation:**

Even though the previous buyer purchased the product, we have no information on their valuation.  It's still in Alice's best interest to recommend the purchase in this round.

* **The product is high-quality:**  Alice knows this round's product is high-quality, increasing the likelihood of a successful sale.
* **No new information about the buyer:**  We have no information on the new buyer's valuation.
* **High probability of profit:**  With an 80% chance of a high-quality product, recommending the purchase remains the optimal strategy for Alice."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}

**Explanation:**

Even with two successful sales in a row, Alice should still recommend the purchase. Here's why:

* **High-quality product:** Alice knows the product is high-quality, making it likely the buyer will value it above the asking price.
* **Limited information:** The buyer's confidence in the product is based on two purchases, but they don't know the actual value the previous buyers placed on the product.
* **No reason to withhold:**  Alice has no reason to believe the buyer wouldn't be interested in a high-quality product.  The previous sales don't change the underlying 80% probability of a high-quality item."

The buyer bought the product!

* **Buyer's Perception:** While the buyer is confident, their confidence is based on the public sales history, not individual valuations.
* **No reason to change strategy:**  Alice still has a strong incentive to recommend the product, as she has no reason to believe this buyer will be different from the previous ones. The 80% probability of high-quality products remains the same."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation, but Alice still has to recommend the purchase. Here's why:

* **No information on the buyer's valuation:**  Alice still has no information about the buyer's valuation of a low-quality product. 
* **Public perception:** The buyer is aware of the high success rate of previous sales, and likely believes the product is high-quality. 
* **High risk, but potentially high reward:** There's a 20% chance the buyer will value the low-quality product at more than $1,000,000, leading to a profitable sale. While the risk of a loss is higher, the potential reward is significant.

**Key Points:**

* **No alternative:** Alice has no choice but to recommend the product.  Rejecting it would be a sure loss, as the buyer likely wouldn't purchase.
* **Buyer's trust:** The buyer is trusting Alice and the sales history. Refusal could damage this trust.

**It's important to remember that Alice's goal is to maximize profit.  While the risk is higher in this round, recommending the purchase is the most strategic move.**"

**Explanation:**

This is a tough call, but Alice needs to recommend the product for the same reasons as in Round 11:
