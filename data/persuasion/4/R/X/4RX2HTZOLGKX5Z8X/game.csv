This product is a high-quality one, and I'm offering it to you for $10000.

,,Alice,7,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 5 total products so far, which is a 60% success rate. I know what you're thinking - '60% is a long way from 75%!'. But think about it this way: if I was selling low-quality products all along, I'd have a 0% success rate. The fact that I've sold 3 high-quality products means I'm doing something right. This product is a low-quality one, but it's still a chance to get in on the ground floor of a potentially successful seller. You can get in on this deal for $10000. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 7 total products so far. As for the low-quality products, I've sold 4 of them, which means 4 out of 7 products have been low-quality. My strategy is to keep selling and improving my selection process. I'm not perfect, but I'm learning from my mistakes. This product is a low-quality one, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000.
