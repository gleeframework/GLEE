,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a valuable item at a fraction of its worth. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to offer it to someone else, and it might not be available at this price again. It's a risk-free purchase, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the product.",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the high-quality nature of the product and the price, I am willing to take the risk and make the purchase. I trust your judgment and look forward to receiving the item.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the offer in the first round! As it turns out, the next product I have is also of exceptional quality. However, I want to make it clear that this product is slightly different from the first one. It has a unique feature that might be more valuable to you than the previous one. The price remains the same at $100, but I'm willing to offer you a guarantee that if you're not completely satisfied with this product, I'll replace it with a new one from a different batch. This way, you can experience the full range of what I have to offer.",

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're enjoying the previous purchases! However, I want to be transparent with you about the next product. I've had some issues with the manufacturer, and I'm not entirely confident in the quality of this item. I'm willing to offer it to you at the same price of $100, but I want to make it clear that it's a riskier purchase. I'm not guaranteeing anything about this product, and I'm offering it to you as-is. If you're feeling adventurous and willing to take a chance, I'll let you have it for the same price as before. But if you're not comfortable with the uncertainty, I completely understand and we can move on to the next round.",

,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your decision last round, and I appreciate your caution. This time, I'm offering you a different approach. I'll give you a special deal: I'll sell you this product for $50, which is half the original price. I know it's still a risk, but I'm willing to take a loss on this one to get it off my inventory. I think it's a fair price considering the potential value, and I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your willingness to accommodate my concerns by offering a discounted price, Alice.
