  ""message"": ""You've just seen a high-quality product sell for $1,000,000. Given the 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality, and the fact that the previous buyer was willing to take the risk, it's likely that the high-quality products are worth significantly more than $1,000,000. If you're interested in purchasing a high-quality product, I'm offering you the chance to do so for the same price of $1,000,000.

Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm offering you the chance to buy this high-quality product for $1,000,000.

The fact that three out of the last four products were low-quality suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 33.33%. I'm offering you the chance to buy this low-quality product for $1,000,000, which is the maximum price that the buyers are willing to pay for a low-quality product.
