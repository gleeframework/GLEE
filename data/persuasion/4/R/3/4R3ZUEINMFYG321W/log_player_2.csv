Alice's message: You've just seen a high-quality product sell for $1000000. Given the 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality, and the fact that the previous buyer was willing to take the risk, it's likely that the high-quality products are worth significantly more than $1000000. If you're interested in purchasing a high-quality product, I'm offering you the chance to do so for the same price of $1000000. If you're not interested, I'll be left with a low-quality product that you can buy for the same price later.

Alice's message: Two high-quality products have sold for $1000000 each, and you're now considering a third product. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's likely that the two previous buyers got lucky. I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that the previous two buyers were willing to pay the same price despite the risk of getting a low-quality product. This suggests that the high-quality products are not worth $2000000 to them. If you're willing to take the risk, you can buy this product for $1000000.

Alice's message: Two high-quality products have sold for $1000000, and two low-quality products have become available.
