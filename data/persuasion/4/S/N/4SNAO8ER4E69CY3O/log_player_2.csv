It's a risk, but it's a chance to get something for a steal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, but considering the product's description and the risk involved, I prefer to continue focusing on securing high-quality products that align with my value expectations.
