Alice's message: I understand your desire for more information. While I don't have any specific patterns or correlations to share, I can provide some context. The products are randomly selected, and each one has an independent 50% chance of being high-quality. The fact that the previous product was low-quality doesn't affect the probability of this one being high-quality. In fact, the probability remains 50%. However, I can offer you a unique opportunity to take advantage of the fact that the previous product was low-quality. Since you're a savvy buyer, I'm willing to offer you a discount of $2000 off the original price of $10000. Would you like to take advantage of this offer and make an offer on the current product?
