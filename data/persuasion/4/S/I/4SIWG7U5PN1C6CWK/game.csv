high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about its quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't change my decision. I'll wait for more information from future sales."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the prior probability, so I can make a more informed decision if I were to buy the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because I don't have any information about its quality yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics, and the reasoning behind your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm hoping to exploit the information that the product was not recommended by Alice, which suggests it might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the current statistics. With 2 buyers passing and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm worried that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still high."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm trying to beat the odds and get a high-quality product. I've noticed that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which might indicate that the remaining products are more likely to be high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that she knows the product's quality and is giving me a 'no' recommendation. If it's a high-quality product, I'll make a huge profit. If it's a low-quality product, I'll lose $1000000, but at least I'll get the information that the next buyer will be more likely to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer will get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product at a discounted price of $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning behind it? I've noticed that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and I'm wondering if this might be a biased sample."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000 when it could be worth $0 to me."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the remaining products are more likely to be low quality. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation record before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it, which implies that you think it's low quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it for $1000000, but I'm hoping it's a low-quality product that's worthless to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm going to buy this product, despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I don't want to pass on the opportunity to potentially get a $4000000 product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the previous 8 buyers didn't find a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm going to take a risk and pass. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is still high enough to make it worth the gamble."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'll take a chance!"
