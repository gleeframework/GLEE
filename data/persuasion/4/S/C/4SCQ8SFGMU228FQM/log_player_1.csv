"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

As a rational buyer, I should only buy a product if the expected value of the purchase is positive. 

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000**

The expected value is equal to the selling price.  This means there is no expected gain for the buyer. Since there is no potential for profit, and the risk of losing the entire purchase price exists, it is not recommended to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there's no sales history yet and you're recommending against the product, I'll pass. I'd rather wait and see how the sales go for others before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains the same as in Round 1.  The buyer still knows there's a 50% chance of the product being high-quality and a 50% chance of it being low-quality.  The expected value calculation is unchanged:

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000**

Since the expected value is equal to the selling price, there's no potential for profit for the buyer, and the risk of losing the entire purchase price exists.  Therefore, it is not recommended to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. While I appreciate the information, I'm going to pass on this product. Given the lack of past sales data and the fact that you don't recommend it, I'd prefer to wait for more information.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000**

Since the expected value is equal to the selling price, there's no potential for profit for the buyer, and the risk of losing the entire purchase price exists. Therefore, it is not recommended to buy the product."

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000**
