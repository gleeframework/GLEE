Alice's message: I understand your hesitation! Since no products have been sold yet, it's natural to wonder about the odds. As the seller, I can assure you that the probability of a high-quality product remains 50%. However, I'd like to share some updated information. Since you're considering buying now, I've sold 1 low-quality product so far (the one from Round 1). This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%, but the probability of it being low-quality is now 50% as well. I'm still confident that this product is a great opportunity, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. What do you think? Will you take the chance?
