low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since it's my first opportunity and I don't have any prior information to go on."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think it's a high probability that it's a low-quality product and I'm willing to take the risk to get a good deal. I'm aware that the previous buyer was recommended to pass and didn't buy, which might indicate a higher chance of a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the previous two buyers were given low-quality products, and the probability of this product being high quality is higher than the overall average. I'm hoping to be the lucky one!"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all the previous products were low-quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't change my decision. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 3 buyers didn't find the product valuable, but I'm willing to take the risk and see if I'm lucky."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you've recommended against it, I'm inclined to think it might be a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the previous 4 buyers were all presented with low-quality products, which is a strong indication that the remaining products are more likely to be high-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased, I suspect that all previous products were low-quality. If the previous products were indeed low-quality, then the current product is likely high-quality, and I'd rather wait for a recommendation from Alice after more buyers have purchased a product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall proportion of high-quality products. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 50%. I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 6 buyers have passed on the products offered to them, and none of the sold products were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is low, so I'm inclined to be cautious and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that this product might be low quality as well."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, as it may affect my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold in the previous 6 purchases, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision."
