Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product selection process. I must admit that the initial 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality was an oversimplification. As I've sold more products, I've refined my approach to selecting products, and I've discovered that certain factors can increase the likelihood of a product being high-quality. For example, I've found that products with certain characteristics, such as rarity or uniqueness, are more likely to be high-quality. I've also developed a more nuanced understanding of the buyer's preferences and goals, which helps me to select products that are more likely to meet their needs. As a result, the probability of a product being high-quality is actually higher than the initial 33.33% chance. However, I must remind you that each product is still unique, and there's always a chance that a product may not meet your expectations.
