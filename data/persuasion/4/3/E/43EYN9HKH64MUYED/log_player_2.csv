After all, I've only sold 2 products, and you can't read too much into that. This next product might be a return to form... or maybe it's a one-off. Either way, it's still a great deal at $100!

Alice's message: Thanks for being cautious! I understand that my previous high-quality streak might have raised your expectations, but I want to be upfront with you - I've had a bit of a mixed bag lately. Out of the 4 products I've sold, 2 have been high-quality, and 2 have been... not so much. I'm not saying this one is definitely low-quality, but I want to be realistic. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll still offer it to you for $100. But if you're looking for a sure thing, you might want to wait for the next one.
