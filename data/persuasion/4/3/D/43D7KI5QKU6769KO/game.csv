,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance, I have no information to go by, and I'll try to break the mold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm the second buyer and I've seen the statistics, which suggest that the proportion of high-quality products is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to get a possible high-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold given the current statistics. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales and no high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already passed on the products and none were high quality, I'm going to pass on this product. I think the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33%, but the fact that the previous buyers didn't buy it suggests that they may have also thought it was low quality. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products recommended were low-quality. I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, it's likely that this product is also low-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products. This suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests that the products sold so far are likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this product to see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers bought the product after your recommendation, and none of the sold products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the products you've been recommending may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, which suggests a very high probability of the product being low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to pass on this product to avoid a potential loss of $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were discouraged from buying, I'm suspicious that all 3 products were low-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this product to see if the next buyer gets a high-quality one."
