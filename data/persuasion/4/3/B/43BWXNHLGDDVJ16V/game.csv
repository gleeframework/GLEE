high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I would like to pass on this product. Based on the 1 out of 1 sales record, it seems like all products sold so far have been high-quality. However, this is likely due to the law of small numbers. I would like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I would like to pass on the product, as I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation. I'd like to see more sales data before making a decision."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I would like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is based on her limited information and I have access to the overall statistics. Given that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 2 purchases, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the same price of $10000. I'm aware that you don't know the value to me, but I'd like to make an offer based on the statistics you've shared so far. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2 purchases, I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk, but I need to negotiate the price."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the low-quality product probability is too low to ignore the potential gain of a high-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she only knows about the previous buyers who purchased the products, and she might be more likely to recommend products that were purchased. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
