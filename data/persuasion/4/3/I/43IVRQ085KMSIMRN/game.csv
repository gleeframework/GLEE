,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, a 16.7% discount from its true value. If you don't buy it, I'll sell it to someone else at the same price. You won't get another chance to buy it for this price.",
,,Bob,1,I'll take it!,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold one high-quality product already, so the probability of the next one being high-quality is now 50%. This product is also a high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. If you don't buy it, I'll sell it to someone else at the same price. Keep in mind that you'll be getting a great deal, as the market value of high-quality products is $12000.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. The probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, and I don't know what the low-quality product is worth to me. I'll pass for now.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me sweeten the deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee: if it's high-quality, you'll get the full $12000 value. If it's low-quality, I'll give you $1000, which is more than its true value to you. So, you'll either get the full value or a profit of $1000. This way, you have a guaranteed minimum gain of $1000. The price remains $10000.",
,,Bob,3,The guarantee makes it a much more attractive deal. I'll take it!,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've made a great decision in the previous round, and I'm glad you're happy with the product. Now, let's talk about the next one. I'll give you a unique opportunity: I'll sell you this product for $9000, which is a 25% discount from the original price. If you don't buy it, I'll sell it to someone else at the same price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to make a concession on this product because I want to build a long-term relationship with you.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced. The discount is nice, but I'm still not sure if the product is high-quality. I'll pass for now.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. Let me be transparent with you. I've sold two high-quality products already, and the probability of the next one being high-quality is now 33.3%. Considering this, I'm willing to sell you this product for $8000, which is an even deeper discount. Keep in mind that you won't get another chance to buy at this price, and you might be leaving money on the table if you pass.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, the probability of it being high-quality is still only 33.3%, and I don't know what the low-quality product is worth to me. I'll have to pass on this offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me put it this way: you've seen that I've sold two high-quality products so far, and one low-quality product. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 66.7%. Considering this, I'm willing to sell you this product for $7000, which is a very attractive price for a product that might be worth $12000 to you. You're essentially getting a 41.7% chance of getting a $12000 product for $7000. Is that a deal you can pass up?",
,,Bob,6,"You're making a compelling argument, Alice. With a 66.7% chance of it being high-quality, the potential reward is too great to pass up. I'll take it!",yes

,,Alice,7,"You've made a great decision, Bob! I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase. Now, let's talk about the next one. Considering the high-quality products you've bought from me so far, I'm willing to offer you a loyalty discount. I'll sell you this product for $8500, which is a 29.2% discount from the original price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with the product. Plus, you've already seen that I'm transparent and willing to make concessions, so I think you can trust that this product is high-quality as well.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the loyalty discount, Alice, but I'm not convinced. You've already sold me a low-quality product, and I don't want to get burned again. I'll have to pass on this offer.",no

I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'll give you a'money-back guarantee' on this product. If it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $10000, and you can walk away with no risk.

I want to be upfront with you: the probability of the next product being high-quality is 50%, and I'm not willing to make any concessions on the price. However, I'm willing to offer you a 'buy-it-now' option: I'll sell you this product to you for $9500, which is a 2.5% discount from the original price. If you don't buy it, I'll sell it to someone else at the same price. You can either take a chance on the product being high-quality or walk away.",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the honesty, Alice, but I'm not interested in taking a chance on a product that has a 50% chance of being low-quality. The discount is not enough to make me take on that risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to acknowledge that you've been a cautious buyer, and I respect that. Given the current state of the market, I'm willing to make a concession on this product. I'll sell it to you for $6000, which is a 40% discount from the original price. I know it's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to take a loss on it just to move it. I'm hoping you'll see the value in taking this opportunity, even if it's not a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice. While I still don't know what the product is worth to me, the discount is significant, and I'm willing to take a chance on it. I'll take it!",yes

I'll sell you this product for $9000, which is a 25% discount from the original price. But here's the twist: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 'product swap' option. If you're not satisfied with this product, you can swap it for any future product of your choice, within a certain timeframe. What do you think?",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate the VIP deal, Alice, but I'm not convinced. The discount is nice, but I'm still not sure if the product is high-quality. The product swap option is interesting, but I'm not sure if I want to take on the risk of getting a low-quality product and then trying to swap it out. I'll have to pass for now.",no

I know it's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to take a significant loss on it just to move it.

,,Bob,12,"Alice, you're really trying to make a deal! I appreciate your willingness to take a loss on the product. I'll take it, but I have to say, I'm starting to wonder if you're trying to get rid of all the low-quality products or if you're just trying to make a sale.",yes

I'll sell you this product for $3000, which is a 70% discount from the original price. This is the lowest price I've ever offered on a product, and I'm only doing it because I value our relationship and want to make you happy. Take it or leave it?",
,,Bob,13,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I think I've learned my lesson. I'm not going to fall for the 'lowest price ever' trick. I'm not going to take a chance on another low-quality product, no matter how cheap it is. I'm going to pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I respect your decision, Bob. I understand that you're being cautious, and I don't blame you. In fact, I'm impressed by your discipline.

I'll give you a full refund of the $3000 I was asking, and we can consider this round a 'free pass'. You can walk away with no risk, and I'll take the loss on the product. No hard feelings, and we can start fresh next round.",

I'm willing to offer you a 30-day satisfaction guarantee, so you can try it out and see for yourself. What do you say?",

If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of the $9500, and I'll also give you a $1000 credit towards your next purchase.

,,Bob,17,"Alice, you're really going all out to make things right! I appreciate your commitment to transparency and honesty.
