high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products, since none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,4,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is neutral, and I don't have any information to go on. I'm willing to take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought, it suggests that the products they were offered were likely low-quality. I'm hesitant to buy without more information."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products sold so far were low quality. I think Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that she has a 50% chance of recommending a product regardless of its quality. I would like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any different."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them ended up buying a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more information or a different recommendation from Alice before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have also passed on the products after Alice's recommendation, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable indicators of product quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
