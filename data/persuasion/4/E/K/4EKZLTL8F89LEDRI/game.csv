low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I know it's a 50/50 chance, but I'm willing to take the risk and see if I get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, given the low number of sales so far and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation. Given that none of the previous buyers bought the product after her recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to see the product go to the next buyer and get a fresh recommendation."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics. I think there might be a bias in Alice's recommendations. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate a higher proportion of low-quality products in the remaining pool. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data, and I'd like Alice to reveal the quality of the product after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the 50% expected. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality and will follow Alice's recommendation to pass on it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous two buyers were recommended to buy and didn't find a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product that she doesn't know about."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, and you're recommending it, I'm inclined to think it might be a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers received low-quality products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the products despite Alice's recommendations, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable.
