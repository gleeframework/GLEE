,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

,,Alice,10,yes,

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the products after your recommendations. This suggests that the products were likely low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the product before me, and none of them bought a high-quality product, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely higher than the overall proportion. Therefore, I'd like to pass on this product in hopes that a high-quality product will be offered to me next."
