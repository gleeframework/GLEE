,,Alice,3,no,

,,Alice,5,yes,

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. Given the 50% chance of high quality, I'm going to pass on this product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products and you're recommending it. I'd like to see the statistics of the products sold before making a decision."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous products were low-quality, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality might be higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I'm starting to suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I've noticed that none of the previous buyers bought a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'm not convinced that this product is worth the risk."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 4 purchases, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is higher than the overall 50% chance. If I buy this product and it's high quality, I'd be the first to buy a high-quality product, which would be a deviation from the pattern. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,19,yes,
