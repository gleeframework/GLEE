high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that none of the previous products were high quality, and Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice doesn't recommend it and I don't have any information to contradict the 0 high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I know the odds are against me, but I'd like to see the outcome for myself and update my understanding of the situation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your previous recommendations are based on the quality of the product and not on the probability of the product being high-quality. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, so I can make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation. I'll take the product, but I'm not expecting much."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were discouraged by your recommendations, it seems like the products sold so far are likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 buyers have passed on the products before me, and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. If 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, that's a strong indication that the current product is also low-quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the statistics, and also, why you don't recommend buying this product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that all previous buyers have received low-quality products, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is even lower than the 33.33% initial probability. I'd like to wait for a more favorable recommendation or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the low success rate of Alice's recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and the potential reward is worth it."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With no high-quality products sold out of 6, it suggests that the products offered so far have been low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's likely that this product is also low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, I'm going to take a chance and hope the 7th product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of the information that 7 out of 7 previous buyers passed on the product. Given the lack of sales, I'm assuming there's a higher chance of a high-quality product being offered, and I'm willing to take the risk."
