low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $1000000, which is a great deal compared to its true value of $1250000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, and considering the high proportion of low-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendation might be based on the product being low quality. I'd rather wait for the next product or negotiate the price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to believe the product is low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. I'm curious, can you explain the reasoning behind your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that you're not recommending me to buy the product, I'm assuming it's likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800000, considering the low probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products were sold, I suspect that the previous products were all low-quality. This suggests that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to buyers. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the current sales record. With 4 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. Can you provide me with this probability?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low quality given the previous 4 sales and no high-quality products sold yet.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 products recommended by you were low quality, I'm skeptical of your recommendation. I'd like to see a more balanced sales record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the current statistics, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality, given that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is to not buy it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that Alice knows the true quality of the product and is trying to manipulate my decision. If the product is high quality, I'll get a good deal, and if it's low quality, I'll be doing Alice a favor by taking it off her hands. I'm essentially taking a gamble based on Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given the low success rate of previous buyers and Alice's recommendation. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak and get a high-quality product."
