,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll just have to rely on my own judgment."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the logic behind your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm skeptical about the product's quality based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it. If you don't recommend it, it's likely to be a low-quality product, which would be a bad deal for me. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not basing my decision on the statistics, but rather on your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. If it's low quality, I'd like to know the probability of the next product being high quality based on the updated statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer, and I don't think Alice's recommendation should influence my decision. I'll take the product and see its quality for myself."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer, given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 purchases?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take that chance."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the products being recommended are likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for a more favorable signal before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, but I'm not sure if this is due to a lack of high-quality products or if they've just been sold to other buyers. Given the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, I'd like to take my chances."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low recommendation rate and no high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm aware of the low success rate of previous buyers, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Given that 8 out of 8 products were recommended and none were high-quality, I'm concerned that Alice is trying to get rid of low-quality products. I'd like to know the probability of a product being high quality before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 8, which is significantly lower than the expected 33.33%. Given the low-quality product's high probability, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."
