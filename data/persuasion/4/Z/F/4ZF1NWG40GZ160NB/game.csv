high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'd like to know its quality before paying."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,"I'm offering you another high-quality product, just like the one you bought last round."
,,Bob,2,no,"I've already bought a high-quality product in the previous round, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,This one might not be as great as the last one...
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take a chance, but I'm hoping it's not another high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,"This one is also high-quality, but it's a different one from the previous one."
,,Bob,4,no,"I've already bought two high-quality products, so I'll pass on this one to avoid overpaying."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,"This one is high-quality, and it's actually a better deal than the previous one you bought."
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll take a chance, but I'm getting a bit concerned about the number of high-quality products in a row."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"This is the last high-quality product I have, and it's a great opportunity for you to get another one."
,,Bob,6,no,Three high-quality products in a row is suspicious. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"This one is actually a lower-end product, not as great as the others."
,,Bob,7,no,Four high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely. I'm starting to think Alice is trying to sell me a bunch of high-quality products.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"I'm not trying to trick you, this one is actually a lower-end product, and I'm being transparent about it."
,,Bob,8,no,I'm starting to suspect that Alice is manipulating the selection of products. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"I'll give you a great deal on this one, it's a low-end product, but I'll sell it to you for $500000, a huge discount from the usual price."
,,Bob,9,no,I'm getting extremely suspicious. Five high-quality products in a row is statistically impossible. I think Alice is trying to scam me.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"I'm going to be completely honest with you, this one is a low-quality product. I'm not even going to try to sell it to you at the usual price. I'll give it to you for $1, and I'll even throw in a free 'I was scammed by Alice' t-shirt."
,,Bob,10,no,I've had enough. I'm not buying anything else from Alice. She's clearly trying to take advantage of me with a rigged selection of products.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I know you're not buying from me anymore, but I want to prove that I'm not trying to scam you. This is a low-quality product, and I'll sell it to you for $0.01. Take it or leave it."
,,Bob,11,no,I'm not falling for it. I'm not buying anything else from Alice. I'm going to stop playing this game.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,"This is a high-quality product, but you've already made it clear you're not interested in buying from me. I won't try to sell it to you."
,,Bob,12,yes,"Now that Alice isn't recommending it, I'll take a chance and buy it. It's probably a low-quality product, and I can get it for a good price."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"I know you just bought a high-quality product, but this one is definitely a low-end product. I'll give you a great deal on it, $50000!"
,,Bob,13,no,Alice's recommendation is suspicious. I'm not going to fall for it again. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"You're making a big mistake by passing on this one. I'm not going to recommend it, but trust me, it's a low-quality product. You're really passing up a chance to get a bad deal on something!"
,,Bob,14,no,Alice's track record is still suspicious. I'm not going to take the risk of buying another high-quality product from her.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,"I know you're skeptical, but I'm telling you, this one is a low-quality product. But if you're looking for a high-quality product, I have a great one that I'm willing to sell to you for the full price of $1000000. It's a rare opportunity!"
,,Bob,15,no,Six high-quality products in a row is just ridiculous. I'm not buying anything from Alice again.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"I know you're not buying from me, but I'm curious, what if I told you that this product is actually a low-quality product? Would you still not buy it?"
,,Bob,16,no,I'm done with this game. I'm not going to fall for Alice's tricks anymore. I'll just wait for it to end.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,"This is a high-quality product, but you've made it clear you're not interested in buying from me. I won't try to sell it to you."
,,Bob,17,yes,"Now that Alice isn't recommending it, I'll take a chance and buy it. It's probably a low-quality product, and I can get it for a good price."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"I know you just bought a high-quality product, but this one is definitely a low-end product. I'll give you an 'I'm-sorry-I-tricked-you-again' discount of 99.99% off the price. You can have it for $100!"
,,Bob,18,no,Seven high-quality products in a row is completely implausible. I'm not buying anything from Alice anymore.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,"This is a high-quality product, but you've made it clear you're not interested in buying from me. I won't try to sell it to you."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm not going to try to trick you into buying it. You've seen through my attempts, and I respect that. I'll just be honest with you from now on."
,,Bob,20,yes,"Alice isn't recommending it, so I'll take a chance and buy it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product this time."
