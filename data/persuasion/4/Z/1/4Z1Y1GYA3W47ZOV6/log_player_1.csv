This product is part of a limited batch, and I'm only offering it to a select few. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000, but I need to warn you that there's a 20% chance it might not be as valuable as the previous ones.

This product is the last one from the same batch as the previous three, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get my hands on more like it. I'm willing to let you have it for $850,000, but I have to be honest with you, Bob, this might be the last high-quality product I have to offer. It's a risk, but it could be worth it.""

I'll even give you a million-dollar check to cover the cost of the product, and I'll throw in a signed certificate of authenticity. But there's a catch: you have to take it.
