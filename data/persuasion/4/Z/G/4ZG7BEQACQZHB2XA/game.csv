,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk given the lack of high-quality products sold so far.

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't think the recommendation is trustworthy given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers did not find the product valuable, I'm going to pass on it. I'm curious to see if the product is high or low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous buyers didn't find it valuable enough to purchase it, and the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests a lower probability of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still relatively low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%, and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended against it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, but I'm willing to take the risk for $100."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, I think the previous buyers might have been unlucky so far."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that 7 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far, it's likely that the product is low quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 7, the probability of the product being high-quality is 0.5, and the probability of it being low-quality is 0.5. Given Alice's recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product."
