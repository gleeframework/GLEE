Alice's message: I see you're a meticulous buyer who wants to understand the process. I'm glad to share with you that I use a rigorous quality control process to determine the quality of each product. However, I must admit that this process is not foolproof, and sometimes we may miss a low-quality product. But don't worry, I'm committed to transparency and honesty. I'll be upfront with you - this product is not high-quality. It's a one-of-a-kind item, but it's not worth the full $10000. I'm willing to let it go for a discounted price of $5000. It's a great opportunity to own a unique item at a fraction of its original value.

The two high-quality products that were sold to the previous buyers were both exceptional items with unique features and characteristics.
