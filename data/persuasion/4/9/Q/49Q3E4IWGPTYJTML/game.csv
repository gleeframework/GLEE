,,the buyer,1,I'm willing to take the risk given the 80% chance of high quality. I'll buy it!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've just seen that the previous buyer took a chance on a product with an 80% chance of being high-quality, but it turned out to be low-quality. This means that the 20% chance of it being low-quality was actually realized. I'm offering you the same opportunity, but I want to make it clear that I'm willing to sell this product to you for the same price of $1000000. If you're still willing to take the risk, please respond with a 'yes' to purchase.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'm going to pass on this one.
