low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've got a product that's not going to change your life, but it's not going to hurt you either. It's a decent product, but it's not the best. I'll give it to you for $100, and I'll even throw in a small gift card to a local store. It's not a great deal, but it's a deal nonetheless.",
