,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're pleased with the additional value I've added to our partnership! However, I want to be transparent with you about this next product. I've been working with a new supplier, and I'm still getting to know their quality standards. This product is a bit of an outlier, and I want to be upfront with you about its value. While it's still a great product, it's not quite at the same level as the previous ones.

Unfortunately, I've had a change in my inventory and I'm left with a small quantity of this product, which is not up to my usual standards. I'm willing to offer it to you at a significantly discounted price of $5000, which is a 50% discount from the usual price. I'm also willing to throw in a complimentary accessory worth $1000, so you can still get some value from the purchase. I understand if you're still hesitant, but I want to give you a clear opportunity to take advantage of this deal.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate your transparency about the product's quality and the discounted price. However, given that you've explicitly stated that the product is not up to your usual standards, I'm still hesitant to take the risk. The complimentary accessory is a nice bonus, but I'm not convinced that it's enough to offset the potential lack of value in the product itself.
