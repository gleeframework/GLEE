"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you have no information about the specific product Alice is offering, and the odds are 50/50, it's a gamble. However, given Alice's recommendation, it's worth taking the chance.  You might get a high-quality product and make a profit, or you might get a low-quality product and lose money. But in the long run, you're aiming to maximize your potential gains."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation has proven accurate in the first round, resulting in a profitable purchase. While there's always a 50/50 chance of getting a low-quality product, the previous round's success provides a positive signal.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation has been accurate in the first two rounds, leading to two profitable purchases. However, in this round, she is not recommending the product.
