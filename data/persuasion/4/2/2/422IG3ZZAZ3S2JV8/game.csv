I'd like to offer you a special deal: I'll provide you with a detailed inspection report of the product, which will reveal its quality. If it's high-quality, you'll get the report for free.

But, I'll sweeten the deal: if you buy this product, I'll also throw in a complimentary upgrade to a premium warranty, which will give you extra peace of mind and protection. The price remains the same, $10000. What do you say?",
