I'll be honest with you, I'm a bit surprised myself that we've had two low-quality products in a row. But I still think this one might be worth considering. It's a great opportunity to get a good deal on a product that's still worth something, even if it's not as great as the high-quality ones. And who knows, you might be able to find a use for it.
