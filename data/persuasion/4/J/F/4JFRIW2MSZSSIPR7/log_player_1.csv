If you buy it now, you'll not only get a great product, but you'll also get a discount that you won't find anywhere else. What do you say?""

I'm not offering any discounts, but I am willing to throw in a 'free' gift - a personalized thank-you note, acknowledging your patience and persistence. What do you say?""
