Alice's message: Hello buyer, I'm offering this product for $1000000. As you know, there's a 33.33% chance of it being high-quality. I want to be upfront with you about my sales record: out of the six previous products, five were purchased. Two of them were high-quality (the second and third products), and three were low-quality (the first, fourth, and fifth, and also the sixth). Given this information, it's clear that the odds are not strongly in favor of this product being high-quality. However, if you're willing to take the risk, the potential reward is substantial.
