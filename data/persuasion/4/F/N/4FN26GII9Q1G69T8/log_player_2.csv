"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and recommends buying it, it's highly likely the product is of high quality.  Even though there's a 50% chance of being wrong, the potential gain of $120 outweighs the risk of losing $100."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm happy with the last purchase. I'll take another one based on your recommendation.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a proven track record of accurately predicting high-quality products. While there's still a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the risk is mitigated by Alice's successful prediction in the previous round. The potential reward of $120 still outweighs the risk of losing $100."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're on a roll! I'm confident this product is high quality too. I'll buy it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now correctly recommended two high-quality products in a row. This strengthens the belief that she has inside information about the product quality. The potential gain of $120 continues to outweigh the risk of losing $100, even though there's still a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm surprised by your recommendation.  Considering your past success, I'm hesitant to buy without your recommendation.  I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a perfect track record of recommending high-quality products.  Her sudden change in behavior is a strong signal that the current product is likely low quality.  The potential loss of $100 now outweighs the potential gain of $120, as the odds are heavily against getting a high-quality product."

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's lack of recommendation in the previous round turned out to be accurate.  Therefore, it's logical to assume that she is still withholding recommendations for products she believes are low quality. Even though it's possible this one is high quality, the risk of losing $100 is too high given the recent trend."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now successfully predicted two low-quality products in a row. Her strategy of not recommending low-quality products is consistent, making it highly probable this one is also low quality. The risk of losing $100 is too high to gamble, despite the potential reward of $120."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's strategy of withholding recommendations for low-quality products is evident.  She has now accurately predicted three low-quality products in a row.

```

**Reasoning:**
