But here's the thing: I've just sold a high-quality product in the previous round, which means I've got a 66.67% chance of selling a high-quality product in the next round (since I've already sold one high-quality product).

  ""message"": ""Good question! If you were to buy a product in the future and receive the 20% discount, it would apply to the original price of $10000, not the discounted price of $8000. So, if you were to buy a high-quality product in the future, you'd get it for $8000, which is a $2000 discount. I think that's a pretty sweet deal, don't you? This low-quality product, on the other hand, is still available for $10000. Would you like to take a chance on it?""
}"

I've implemented new quality control measures, and I'm confident that my future products will be of higher quality. This low-quality product, on the other hand, is a relic of my past mistakes. I'm willing to sell it to you for $5000, and I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product you buy from me, regardless of its quality. Would you like to take a chance on it?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not convinced that this product is worth the risk. Given the 66.67% chance of it being low-quality, I'd rather pass on this one.
