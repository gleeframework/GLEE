I'll give you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $1,000,000, but I'll also offer you a 'deal' - if you buy this product, I'll give you the exact price I sold the first product for.

I'll offer you a similar deal - if you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you the exact price I sold the second product for. If you're interested, you'll get the high-quality product for $1,000,000, and I'll also give you $1,000,000, making the total 'deal' price $2,000,000.

I'll offer you a choice: you can either buy this high-quality product for $1,000,000, or you can take a chance on the 'deal' and get the high-quality product for $2,000,000. Keep in mind that I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, and you know that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. What do you think?""

Since you've seen 5 high-quality products in a row, it's possible that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually higher than 50%.
