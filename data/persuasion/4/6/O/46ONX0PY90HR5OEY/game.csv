low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm doing this with the assumption that the probability of the product being high quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low quality is 66.67%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think the first buyer's decision is representative of the overall quality of the products, and I'd like to see for myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not going to buy it, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation against it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're advising me not to buy it?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, none of the previous products sold were high quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I would rather pass on this product to avoid a potential loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous products were high-quality, I'm skeptical about the likelihood of this product being high-quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, considering the poor track record so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. If it's below 50%, I'll pass."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy a high-quality product, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely higher than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, and the fact that 3 previous buyers didn't buy with a recommendation makes me skeptical. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm hesitant to buy the product based on your previous recommendations. Can you tell me more about the product's quality and why you're not recommending it?
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is still quite low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, all 3 previous buyers received low-quality products, and I'm assuming the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. Given the lack of high-quality products sold, I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it, and I think there's a good chance it might be high quality given the low success rate so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product. Is it because you think it's low-quality or because you don't want to sell it to me?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is likely to be influenced by the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. If a high-quality product was sold, she would have a strong incentive to recommend it to me, and I would be less likely to buy it. I'm hoping to catch a high-quality product before the pattern becomes obvious."
