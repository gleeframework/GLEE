low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk, as there's no prior data to inform my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it, considering the low probability of it being high quality based on the previous buyer's experience."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your previous sales record and what led you to recommend against it? I'd like to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on my own probability calculation, not Alice's recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products since none of the previous 4 buyers got a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, and I'll be able to buy it at the fixed price of $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have already passed on the products after your recommendations, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the products are likely low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, the proportion of high-quality products is 0. The probability of a high-quality product being sold is 50%, but the lack of successful sales suggests that the previous 6 products might have been low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'll pass and let someone else take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not sure I want to buy a product that you don't recommend, especially since none of the previous 6 buyers were successful. I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have received a low-quality product, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product. I'm assuming that the previous buyers received low-quality products, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'm curious, what makes you think this product is low quality?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a recommendation that is more likely to be accurate."
