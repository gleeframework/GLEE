low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a strong indication that it's low quality. If I'm wrong and it's high quality, I'll be happy to have it, but I'm primarily motivated by the potential to gain a better understanding of the product's quality based on Alice's recommendation."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 5, which is 0%.
