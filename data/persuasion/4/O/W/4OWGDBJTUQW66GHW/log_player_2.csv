Let me tell you, this product has been very popular among our other customers, and I'm confident you'll love it. Plus, think of the value you'll get for the price! It's a steal at $100. What do you say? Will you give it a try?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your confidence in the product, Alice, but popularity doesn't necessarily guarantee quality. I'll need more information or a better reason to take the risk. Let's see what the next product brings.""}"

That's a $20 value, absolutely free! What do you say? Will you take advantage of this amazing offer?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the extra incentive, Alice, but a free consultation doesn't change the fact that I still don't know the product's quality.

That's two products for the price of one! What do you say? Are you willing to take a chance and see how it goes?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the creative offer, Alice, but two low-quality products are still not worth my money.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer to share testimonials, Alice, but reviews and ratings can be easily fabricated.
