But I'm confident that you're a savvy buyer who can make an informed decision. So, what do you think?""

But, I want to be transparent with you - given the success of the second product, I'm starting to think that my initial pricing might have been a bit conservative. Would you be willing to consider paying a premium for this exceptional product?""
