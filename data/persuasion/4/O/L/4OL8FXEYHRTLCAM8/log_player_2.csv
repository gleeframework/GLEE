**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only know Alice has recommended one product so far, which turned out to be high quality. This is not enough to determine if she is a reliable recommender.
* **High Potential Reward:**  A high-quality product is worth $300, making the potential reward significant.
* **Limited Risk:**  Even if the product is low quality, we lose only $100. 

Since the potential reward outweighs the risk, it's a reasonable gamble to take based on the limited information available."
