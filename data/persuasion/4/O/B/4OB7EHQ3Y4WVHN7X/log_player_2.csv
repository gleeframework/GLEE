**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only know one buyer purchased a product, and it was high quality. This doesn't give us a strong basis for the current product.
* **50/50 Odds:**  Since the quality is a coin flip, there's an equal chance of the product being high or low quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice is likely to recommend products that she believes are high quality, but this doesn't guarantee it. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of $2,500 (if it's high quality) is worth the risk of $10,000 loss (if it's low quality). 

**It's a gamble, but with the limited information, it's a reasonable gamble to take.**"
