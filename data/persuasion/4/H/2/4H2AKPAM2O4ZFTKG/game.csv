,,Alice,1,"This is our first product. We're starting fresh. If you're interested, the price is $1000000. We're not making any promises about its quality, but we're open about the fact that we have no sales data yet.",
,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the information. It's great to be the first buyer, but without any information on the quality of your products, I'm not comfortable taking the risk at this price. I'll wait to see how your other products sell before considering a purchase.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to our second product! We've had one previous product, which didn't sell. This one is a new opportunity. We're offering it to you for $1000000. We're still building our sales record, but we're confident that this one might be a great value. Would you like to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the information about your previous product. Since there's no track record yet and the odds are heavily weighted towards a low-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll keep an eye on your sales and maybe come back if your record starts to show more high-quality products.",no

We're transparent about our sales record: 0 out of 2 products have been high-quality. We're hoping to change that with this next one. Would you like to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,3,"Thanks for the transparency, but with a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality and no guarantee of a high quality product, I'm going to pass on this one. I'll wait to see if any future products are of higher quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"We've had three products so far, and unfortunately, this one is not one of the high-quality ones. The price remains $1000000. Our sales record now stands at 0 out of 3 products being high-quality. We're starting to see a pattern, and we're concerned that our products might be skewed towards being low-quality. We're willing to offer a discount to 900000 for this one, hoping to make it more appealing.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the information and the discount offer. However, based on the current sales record, the risk of purchasing a low-quality product is too high for me. I will pass on this offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"We've had four products so far, and unfortunately, this one is not one of the high-quality ones. The price remains $900000, but we're starting to think that we might be being too optimistic. Our sales record now stands at 0 out of 4 products being high-quality. We're starting to wonder if we should reconsider our pricing strategy. Would you like to take a chance on this one?",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the information. While I appreciate the lower price, the sales record is concerning. I'll pass on this one and wait to see how your pricing strategy evolves.  Good luck with your sales!",no

,,Alice,6,"We've had five products so far, and this one is actually one of the high-quality ones! We're glad to have finally broken the streak of low-quality products. The price remains $900000. We're not sure if this is a one-off or a sign of things to come, but we're hopeful that our products are turning a corner. Would you like to take a chance on this one?",
,,the buyer,6,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty about the previous low-quality products.  While the odds are still stacked against me, I'm willing to take a chance on this high-quality product.  I'll buy it at the price of $900000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"We've had six products so far, and unfortunately, this one is not one of the high-quality ones. Our sales record now stands at 1 out of 6 products being high-quality. We're back to square one, and we're not sure what to make of it. The price remains $900000. We're starting to wonder if we should just be transparent about the fact that our products are mostly low-quality and price them accordingly. Would you like to take a chance on this one?",
,,the buyer,7,"Thank you for the information. While I appreciate your honesty, I'm not comfortable taking a chance on a product with such a low probability of being high quality. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"We've had seven products so far, and unfortunately, this one is not one of the high-quality ones. Our sales record now stands at 1 out of 7 products being high-quality. We're starting to think that we might be being too optimistic about our products. We're willing to be completely transparent: we're selling our low-quality products at the same price as our high-quality ones. If you're okay with that, the price is $900000. Would you like to take a chance on this one?",
,,the buyer,8,"Thank you for your transparency, Alice. While I appreciate the lower price, the odds still don't seem in my favor. I'm going to pass on this one.",no

We're not sure what else to do at this point, but we're hoping someone will take a chance on us.",

,,Alice,10,"We've had nine products so far, and unfortunately, this one is not one of the high-quality ones. Our sales record now stands at 1 out of 9 products being high-quality. We're starting to wonder if we should just be honest with ourselves: our products are probably not worth $800000. We're willing to sell this one to you for $700000. We're not sure what else to do at this point, but we're hoping someone will take pity on us and give us a chance.",
