However, I don't have any direct feedback from them regarding their experiences. I can tell you that the buyers who purchased high-quality products seemed to be motivated by a desire to understand the probability of high-quality products being sold, rather than any specific features of the products themselves.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to take the product home.
