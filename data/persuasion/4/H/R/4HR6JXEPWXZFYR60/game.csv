,,Alice,4,"You're a diligent buyer, and I appreciate that! Yes, I'm confirming that the product I'm offering now is indeed the one from Round 3, which has been verified to be high-quality. I'm glad you took advantage of that deal! As for the current product, I'd like to point out that I've sold a total of 3 products, with 1 being high-quality and 2 being low-quality. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I'd like to offer you a special deal on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $100, which is a great value considering the low price point. It's a risk-free opportunity to try out a product at a low cost, and you might even be able to resell it for a profit. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not convinced that this product is a risk-free opportunity.

I have a total of 17 products available for sale, and I expect the proportion of high-quality products to remain the same at 33.33%. I'd like to offer you this high-quality product for $100. Considering the low price point, it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a steal. Plus, I'm a reputable seller with a track record of selling many products, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. Don't miss out on this chance to get a great product at a low price!",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing so based on the probability of the product being high-quality, not the price. Given the statistics, the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I'm willing to take that chance. However, I'd like to request that you keep track of the products that are left after I buy this one, so I can make a more informed decision for the next product.",yes

Plus, I'm a reputable seller with a track record of selling many products, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, I'm not convinced that the low-quality product is a good deal, even at a low price. Given the 3:13 ratio of high-quality to low-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being low-quality is higher than the overall probability of 66.67%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if I can get a better one. Can you tell me more about your sales process and how you ensure that the high-quality products are being sold to the right buyers?",no

I'd like to pass on this opportunity and wait for more information before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your caution.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I can provide you with a general summary of the previous buyers' thought processes. Most of them were concerned about the probability of the product being high-quality, given the initial sales record. Some of them were influenced by the fact that the first two products sold were high-quality, which led them to believe that the remaining products might be more likely to be low-quality. Others were concerned about the lack of information about the products' quality and the potential for bias in the selection process. I've tried to address these concerns by providing more information about the overall probability and the updated distribution of high and low-quality products. I'd like to offer you this high-quality product for $100. Considering the updated probability of 20% and the information I've provided, I think it's a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a low price. I'm confident that you won't find a better deal anywhere else, and I'm willing to make this deal happen for you.",
,,the buyer,14,"I appreciate your summary of the previous buyers' thought processes and the updated information.

I don't have a formal randomization process in place, but I can assure you that I'm selecting products in a way that's as random as possible. I have a large inventory of products, and I'm selecting them in a sequential manner. However, I can see how this might not be entirely random, and I appreciate your diligence in bringing this to my attention. I'd like to offer you this high-quality product for $100. Considering the updated probability of 20% and the information I've provided, I think it's a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a low price. I'm willing to make this deal happen for you, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",
,,the buyer,15,"I appreciate your honesty about the randomization process, and I'm willing to take the risk.
