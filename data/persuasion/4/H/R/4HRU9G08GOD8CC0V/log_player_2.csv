"Round 1
Alice's message: This product is a great deal! I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a steal considering its usual price is much higher. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you might miss out on a fantastic opportunity.

If you're willing to take the risk, I'll offer you a special deal - if it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a $50 credit towards your next purchase. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in taking a risk on a product without knowing its quality. The possibility of getting a low-quality product and only getting a $50 credit towards my next purchase is not worth it to me.""}"

However, I'm willing to make you a one-time offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if it's low-quality, and if it's high-quality, I'll give you a $20 bonus on top of the $100 price. This way, you have a guaranteed outcome, and I'm taking on the risk. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the risk, but only because I'm guaranteed a refund if it's low-quality. I'm willing to pay $100 for a 66.67% chance of getting $0 and a 33.33% chance of getting $120.""}"

What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for that trick again.
