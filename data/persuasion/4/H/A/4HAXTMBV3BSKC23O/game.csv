,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and the odds are stacked against me. I'd rather wait and see how the sales record develops before making a decision."

,,Alice,3,no,

,,Alice,5,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, I'm not convinced by the statistics, and I think it's a good opportunity to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 3 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is low. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation and the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the fact that none of the previous products were high-quality suggests that the remaining products might be low-quality as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers did not buy the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the products are all low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better deal or if the product is indeed low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you've recommended against it. This suggests that the product is likely to be low quality. I'm hoping to be the exception, but I'm also aware that I'm taking a risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because of the statistics or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not buying. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were not recommended to buy and no high-quality product has been sold, I'm starting to suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your previous recommendations don't carry much weight with me, and I'd like to make my own decision based on the odds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the statistics. If it's higher than 50%, I'd like to buy. If not, I'll pass."

,,Alice,15,yes,

,,Alice,16,no,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 buyers have bought the products recommended by you, which suggests that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I will not buy the product, as I suspect it might be low quality."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
