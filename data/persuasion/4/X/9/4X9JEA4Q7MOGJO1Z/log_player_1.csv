"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you have no information about the buyer's valuation of high-quality products, the best strategy is to always recommend buying a high-quality product. You know it's high-quality, and the buyer knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%.  This means there's a good chance the buyer will value it highly enough to buy it at $10,000."

**Reasoning:**

You now have a track record. You have sold one product, and it was high-quality. The buyer, however, doesn't know this. From their perspective, you have a 100% success rate for selling high-quality products, which is significantly higher than the 80% average.  

Given the risk of selling a low-quality product and potentially damaging your reputation, it's best to not recommend the purchase this time.  You want to build trust and ensure a positive buying experience for future buyers."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  I appreciate you being upfront about your recommendation. Since you're not recommending it, I'll pass on this product.  Good luck to the next buyer!
