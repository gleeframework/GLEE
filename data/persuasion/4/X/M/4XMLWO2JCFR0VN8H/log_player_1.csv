"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob doesn't know the specific quality of the product, he knows that there's an 80% chance it's high-quality.  

* If it's high-quality, he makes a profit of $200 - $100 = $100.
* If it's low-quality, he loses $100.

The expected value of buying the product is: 

(0.8 * $100) + (0.2 * -$100) = $80 - $20 = $60

This means, on average, Bob will make a profit of $60 by buying the product. Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product."

Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows the product is either high-quality (worth $200 to him) or low-quality (worth $0 to him). He also knows that the price is $100.  Since the product is non-refundable, Bob would only be willing to buy it if he was **certain** it was high-quality. 

In this round, the product is low-quality, so Bob would lose money if he bought it. Therefore, it is not recommended to buy the product."
"Bob's message: Since Alice doesn't recommend it and she knows the product's quality, I'll trust her judgment this time.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob didn't buy the product in the previous round, the situation resets for each round. The previous round's outcome doesn't change the fact that there's still an 80% chance of the product being high-quality.

* If the product is high-quality, Bob makes a $100 profit.
* If the product is low-quality, Bob loses $100.

As calculated in the first round, the expected value of buying is still $60. Therefore, it's still recommended to buy the product in this round."
