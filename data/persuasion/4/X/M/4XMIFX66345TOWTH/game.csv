,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! I'm glad the first buyer was willing to take a chance. I've sold 1 product so far, and it's a low-quality one. I'm offering you the next one for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling another low-quality product. It's a chance to get a potentially great deal, but you know what they say: 'you can't win if you don't play'!",

But think of it this way: you're getting a chance to buy a product at a price that's 50% of its potential value. If you don't take the risk, you'll never know what could have been. It's a calculated gamble, and I'm willing to take the risk. Are you in?",

I know it's tough to trust me right now, but I assure you that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm willing to take on the risk.

Am I just getting lucky, or is there something going on with my products? I'm not sure, but I'm willing to take the risk.

This one is another high-quality gem, worth $20000 to you. I'm offering it to you for $10000, a 50% discount. But here's the thing: I've been thinking about my sales strategy, and I'm starting to wonder if I've been playing it too safe.
