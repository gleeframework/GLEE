low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, I don't have any information to go on yet, so I might as well make the first purchase to start the data collection."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the previous buyer's experience or based on the statistics?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your previous recommendations. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely higher than the overall average. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products changes."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards high-quality products, but since no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous two buyers also bought the product and didn't get a high-quality one. This suggests that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, and based on the statistics, it seems like the products sold so far are low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality, and I'm not sure if this one is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm curious about your reasoning behind not recommending it, though."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low quality, which is a strong indication that the remaining products are likely to be low quality as well."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics so far. Can you provide that information?"
