This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has confirmed the product is high-quality, and Bob knows that high-quality products are 80% likely, it's highly probable that this product is indeed valuable. While Bob doesn't know the exact value, the risk is low, and the potential reward of a high-quality product at $1,000,000 is significant. Therefore, recommending a purchase is the best strategy."
