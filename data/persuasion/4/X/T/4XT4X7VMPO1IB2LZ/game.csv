,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know your reasoning behind not recommending it. Is it because you're unsure of the product's quality or something else?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation. I'm concerned that if the product is low quality, I'll be the one who ends up buying it, and I don't want to waste my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to give me a discount. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm worried that the product might be low-quality and I don't want to lose $100. If I get a discount, I'll consider buying it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, and the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I don't have any information about the product's quality and Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality. I'm hoping that the product is high-quality, but I'm also aware that the probability of that is 33.33%."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I'd rather not risk buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. If I buy, I'll be the first to purchase a product that Alice has recommended, which increases the likelihood that it's high-quality. However, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I don't want to be the first to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm inclined to believe it's a low-quality product. With a 66.67% chance of being low quality, it's likely not worth my while."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous buyers' purchases, it seems like the products offered so far have been low-quality, and I'd like to wait for a potentially higher-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to ask, how many products have been sold in total, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think it's low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the expected 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'll pass on this one. Can I see the product and decide for myself?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered, based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4. If it's lower than 10%, I'll pass."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, the fact that no high-quality products were sold suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."

,,Alice,19,no,
