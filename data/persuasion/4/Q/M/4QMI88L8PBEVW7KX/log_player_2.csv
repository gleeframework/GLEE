**Explanation:**

While the odds are still against us (66.67% chance of low quality), the fact that Alice has a 100% success rate with her recommendations so far is a strong indicator that she has a way of identifying high-quality products.  Since the potential gain from a high-quality product ($1,250,000) is significantly higher than the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0), it makes sense to take a chance."
