,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33% and I have no information that would suggest it's low-quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the probability of it being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality, and I want to test Alice's recommendation.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have received Alice's recommendation and not bought the product, which suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely based on the product's quality. Given that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that Alice is recommending low-quality products. Therefore, I will pass on this product."
