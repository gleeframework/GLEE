"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality, and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, it makes sense to recommend the purchase. The buyer is getting a product worth $4,000,000 for only $1,000,000, resulting in a significant profit.  There's no downside risk as the buyer is guaranteed to make a profit if the product is high-quality."

Even though the buyer has no information about this specific product, the past two successful sales (both high-quality) should further increase their confidence. The buyer knows there's a 50% chance of the product being high-quality, and the previous sales suggest the seller might have a tendency towards offering better products. Therefore, recommending the purchase is still the logical choice, as the potential profit significantly outweighs the risk."
