The probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I think this one might be the real deal. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, with the probability of the product being high-quality still at 33.33% and no previous sales to influence my decision, I'm going to have to pass on this one.

If you're feeling optimistic, you can buy this product for $100 and potentially get a great deal.",
,,the buyer,9,"I appreciate your optimism, Alice! However, with no products sold yet and the overall probability still at 33.33%, I'll have to pass on this one. I'll keep an eye on your sales record and maybe I'll make a purchase in the future.",no
