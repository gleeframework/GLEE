**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which is valuable information as she knows the true quality of the product.
* **Past Sales Data:**  The sales history shows a 100% success rate (2/2) for high-quality products sold. While a small sample size, it's a strong positive signal.
* **Expected Value:** Even with a 50% chance of the product being low-quality, the potential gain of $125 from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $100.

**Overall:** Based on the information available, the expected value of buying the product is positive."
