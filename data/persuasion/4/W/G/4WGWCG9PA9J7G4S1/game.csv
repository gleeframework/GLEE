,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to, as I have no prior information to go on and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,2,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I can potentially get a $40000 value out of it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, Alice. I know you know how much I value a high-quality product, but your recommendation doesn't necessarily mean anything. I'll take the risk and buy it, hoping it's the one high-quality product I've been waiting for!"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the product despite the low quality rate, I suspect that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, I'm going to pass on this product. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low quality, which suggests a very low chance of the product being high quality. I'll pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the statistics suggest."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers didn't buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that the products are all low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have purchased the product despite Alice's recommendation, it's likely that the products they bought were low-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 5 purchases, and considering the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. How many products have been sold in total, and what is the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I believe the probability of this product being high-quality is still around 33.33%. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000, considering its value to me is only $0."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous 5 buyers didn't find the product valuable, or is there something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and have all rejected the product, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one as well. I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to get rid of a low-quality product."
