Alice's message: I'm glad you're confident in my products! However, I want to let you know that I've had a bit of a run of good luck with the last few products, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to keep this streak going. I'm willing to offer you a 'insurance policy' - if the next product I sell is not high-quality, I'll give you a $5000 credit towards the purchase of a future product. This way, you can mitigate some of the risk, and I'll still get the sale. The price remains at $10000.
