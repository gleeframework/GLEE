**Explanation:**

This scenario presents a classic Bayesian reasoning problem. While the initial probability of a high-quality product is 50%, the fact that the previous 3 buyers, all guided by Alice's recommendations, purchased products that turned out to be high-quality drastically changes the odds in favor of the current product being high-quality as well.  

The provided information doesn't allow for a precise calculation of the updated probability, but it strongly suggests the likelihood of a high-quality product is much higher now. Therefore, the best strategy is to accept the recommendation and purchase the product."
