,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm selling it to you for $10000. I've sold 0 products so far, and I have a 80% chance of selling a high-quality product. If you buy this product, you'll be getting an item worth at least 80% of the products I sell. If you don't buy it, I'll keep selling, and the next product might be even better. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product! I'm excited to be the first one to buy from you, Alice. I'm hoping it's indeed a high-quality product worth $30000.",yes

,,Alice,2,"You're the second buyer, and I'm glad you're interested! I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, which is 100% of the products I've sold. This means the probability of the next product being high-quality is also 80%. Keep in mind that the first product was sold for $10000, and you have no information about its actual value. I'm selling this new product for the same price. You can choose to buy it, or wait for the next one, which might be high-quality and worth more or less. What's your decision?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, hoping it's high-quality and worth $30000.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're the third buyer, and I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. However, it's worth noting that the first two products were sold for $10000 each, and you don't know if they're worth more or less. I'm selling this new product for the same price. You can choose to buy it, or wait for the next one, which might be high-quality and worth more or less. Additionally, I want to remind you that I've sold 2 out of 2 high-quality products so far, which is a 100% success rate. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the current product, considering the high success rate and the same price as the previous products. I'll take a chance and hope it's high-quality.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're the fourth buyer, and I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. However, it's worth noting that the first three products were sold for $10000 each, and you don't know if they're worth more or less. I want to remind you that I've sold 3 out of 3 high-quality products so far, which is a 100% success rate. But, I'd like to offer you a different perspective: if you don't buy this product, I'll have sold 3 high-quality products and 1 unknown product, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is 75%. You can choose to buy this product for $10000, or wait for the next one, which might be high-quality and worth more or less. What's your decision?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given the impressive 100% success rate so far. I'll take a chance on the 80% chance of it being high-quality and potentially worth $30000 to me.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're the fifth buyer, and I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. However, I want to highlight that the streak of high-quality products might be a coincidence, and the next product could be low-quality. On the other hand, the fact that I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row suggests that I might be more likely to sell high-quality products. I'm selling this new product for $10000. Considering the 80% probability and the potential for a low-quality product, you can choose to buy it, or wait for the next one, which might be high-quality and worth more or less. Additionally, I'll give you a heads up: I've sold 4 out of 4 high-quality products, and 1 out of 4 total products. What's your decision?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the risk and buy the current product. The streak of high-quality products is intriguing, and I'm willing to take a chance on the 80% probability of it being high-quality. I'm hoping it will be worth $30000 to me.",yes

On the other hand, the price remains the same at $10000. Considering the streak and the price, you can choose to buy this product, or wait for the next one, which might be high-quality and worth more or less. Additionally, I'll give you a statistic: I've sold 5 out of 5 high-quality products, and 5 out of 6 total products. What's your decision?",
