low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as I believe the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about its quality and I'm not influenced by your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100, which is less than its value to me if it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending it?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 buyers have not purchased high-quality products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely low. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I will pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, given Alice's recommendation and the current statistics. I'm concerned that if she's not recommending it, it's likely to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product, I'm inclined to think it's likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is better."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 products have been low-quality so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 6 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like the probability of getting a high-quality product is very low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when I know it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation based on the past sales record. Since no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations, Alice. If 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, I'd rather not take the chance."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
