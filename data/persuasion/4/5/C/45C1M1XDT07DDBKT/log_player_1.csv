* **From your perspective:** You should always recommend buying a high-quality product, as it's likely worth more to the buyer. 
* **From the buyer's perspective:**  While the buyer doesn't know the quality, they should be willing to take a chance in the first round, given the probability of a high-quality product is not negligible (33.33%).
