,,Alice,4,no,,

,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, and considering the 0 high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one.",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of the products were high quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards encouraging buyers to purchase, regardless of the product's quality. I'd like to wait and see if the pattern continues.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,no,,"10 products sold, 2 high-quality products, 8 low-quality products, all previous recommendations were to buy, but none of the recommended products were high-quality"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,no,,"13 products sold, 2 high-quality products, 11 low-quality products, three previous buyers took the risk and bought low-quality products"

,,Alice,18,no,,"14 products sold, 2 high-quality products, 12 low-quality products, previous buyer didn't buy due to lack of recommendation"
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is not to buy it, which makes me suspicious that the product might be high quality.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,yes,,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the current statistics, 7 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is not reliable. I'll pass on this product.",
