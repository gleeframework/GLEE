**Explanation:**

* **High Probability of High-Quality Product:** The fact that one high-quality product has been sold out of only one sale suggests a very high chance of the current product also being high quality. While there's still a 66.67% chance of it being low quality, the odds are in our favor given the previous sale. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice has access to the true quality of the product and knows our valuation. Her recommendation to buy strongly indicates that she believes the product is high-quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there is a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a $2,000,000 gain outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000, especially given the information available. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the information available at this point in the game.  The strategy might change as more data becomes available, especially if more low-quality products are sold in the future."
