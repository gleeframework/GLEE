Alice's message: I see you're a savvy customer! You're right to be cautious. Let me give you some context: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products so far. That's a 50% success rate, which is actually lower than the 33.33% probability of getting a high-quality product. You might think that's a red flag, but I assure you, it's just a minor setback. I'm confident that my next product will be a winner. And if it's not, well... you can always try your luck again next time. So, what do you say? Are you ready to take a chance on this product for $1000000?

Alice's message: I respect your diligence in doing your research. I'll give you some more information to consider.
