,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me might be low."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is significantly lower than the true probability of 33.33%. I believe the product is more likely to be low-quality, so I'll pass on it."
