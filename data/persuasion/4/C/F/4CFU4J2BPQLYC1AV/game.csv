low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as I don't have any information to go on yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is based on the previous sales record and may not reflect the actual quality of the product. I'm making my decision based on the probability of the product being high quality, which is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, but given the fact that 3 out of 3 previous products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm starting to suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more information or a change in your recommendation strategy before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, so I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry. If she didn't recommend it, it's likely to be a low-quality product, and I'm hoping to get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, all previous buyers received a recommendation not to buy, which suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products. Given the low quality of the products sold so far, I will also pass on this product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. The probability of it being high quality is 33.33%, but I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data, and I'd like Alice to reveal the quality of the product after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is reliable, given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm hoping to be the one who gets a high-quality product"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 6 out of 6 products recommended were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. Can I see the product first? I'd like to make my own decision based on its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations. The fact that 7 out of 7 previous buyers didn't get a high-quality product suggests that the remaining products might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products so far?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 out of 7 products were low quality, I suspect the probability of a high-quality product being offered has increased. I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers have purchased the product despite Alice's recommendation, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. This implies that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
