low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, which suggests that the products she has recommended might be low-quality.

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, and Alice's recommendation doesn't change my uncertainty about the product's quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to risk losing $10000."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to ask, can you share the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping that the low-quality products are more likely to be sold already, and I'm taking a chance on the high-quality one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm going to pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share that with me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because you're trying to avoid selling a high-quality product to me, or is it because you think the product is low quality? I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to understand your thought process."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a clear explanation for your previous recommendations. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the products you recommended were likely low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I need to understand your thought process behind your previous recommendations."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 6 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products is still low."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6 purchases so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the information that none of the previous 6 buyers have bought a high-quality product. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and none of the previous buyers have bought a high-quality product, I'm going to take a chance and buy this product, hoping it might be the first high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,18,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 buyers were discouraged from buying, I'm inclined to think that all the products sold so far were low-quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"
