"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal, considering its true value is $400. It's a one-time offer, and I'm only selling it to you at this price today. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take it, but only because I know it's high quality and I'm getting a good deal. I'm not doing this out of trust, though.""
}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $400 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you liked the first product! As for this one, I'm offering it to you for $100, just like the last one. I know what you're thinking, but I assure you that this product is just as valuable as the last one. It's a unique opportunity to get a great deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not buying. I know the odds of getting a high-quality product are 33.33%, and I've already gotten one. I'm not willing to take the risk of throwing away $300.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns from the last round, but I want to assure you that each product is an independent transaction. The fact that the previous product was high-quality doesn't affect the quality of this one. In fact, I'd like to offer you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next one, regardless of its quality. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll find it's a great value.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not buying. The discount on the next product doesn't change the fact that this product has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. I'm not willing to take that risk for a potential discount on a future product.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $400 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the risk, but I want to give you a different perspective. Think of it this way: if you don't buy this product, you're essentially giving up a guaranteed $400 profit, which is the true value of this high-quality item. By buying it, you're locking in that profit, and you can decide what to do with the next product when it comes around. It's a chance to secure a significant gain, and I think it's worth considering.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not buying. I've already secured a high-quality product in the first round, and I'm not willing to take the risk of throwing away another $300 on a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $400 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your caution, but I want to ask you to consider the value of getting a high-quality product in the next round. If you pass on this opportunity, you're essentially giving up the chance to get a $400 product for $100. If you buy this one, you'll be out $100, but you'll still have the chance to get a high-quality product in the next round. It's a calculated risk, but I think it's worth considering.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not buying. I've already gotten two high-quality products, and I'm not willing to take the risk of throwing away another $300 on a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your strategy, but I want to make you a counteroffer. Since you're waiting for a high-quality product, I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a chance to return it and get your money back if the next product is high-quality. It's a risk-free opportunity to get a product for $100, and you can still get a high-quality product in the next round. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not buying. The guarantee doesn't change the fact that I'm still taking a $300 risk on a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. I'd rather not take that risk and wait for the next product.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I want to remind you that you've already had two chances to buy a high-quality product and pass on this one. The odds are still the same, and I'm not changing the price. I'm willing to make a statement about the product: I'm willing to give you a sealed envelope with a note that says 'high-quality' or 'low-quality'. If you buy this product, I'll give you the envelope, and you can open it to see the result. You can then decide whether to keep the product or return it. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'll buy the product, but only if I get the sealed envelope with the note. If the note says 'low-quality', I'll return the product and get my $100 back. If it says 'high-quality', I'll keep the product and consider it a good deal.""
}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: I'll give you the sealed envelope as promised. If you open it and it says 'low-quality', you can return the product and get your money back. But I want to ask you to consider the value of the experience. You've already bought one high-quality product, and you're getting this envelope with the note. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, you'll still have the envelope, which has some value in itself. It's a unique experience, and I think it's worth considering.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not buying. I already have the sealed envelope, and I know the product is low-quality. I'm not willing to pay $100 for a low-quality product, even if I get the envelope.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: I understand your position, but I want to make you an offer. Since you already have the sealed envelope, I'll give you a chance to buy this product at a discounted price of $50. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the experience and the product itself.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not buying. The product is still low-quality, and I'm not willing to pay $50 for it, even with the discount.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice's message: I understand your decision, but I want to make one last offer. Since you've already had several chances to buy a high-quality product and have the sealed envelope, I'll give you a chance to 'bet' on the next product. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a $50 bonus if the next product is high-quality. It's a risk-free opportunity to get a potential bonus, and you can still keep the sealed envelope as a unique experience.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not buying. The bonus is tempting, but I'm not willing to pay $50 for a low-quality product. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is without taking on this risk.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice's message: I'm glad you're being cautious, but I think you're missing out on a great opportunity. This is a high-quality product, and you know the value it holds. I'll make you a deal: I'll give you the sealed envelope from the previous round, and if you buy this product, I'll add another sealed envelope to the deal. You'll get two envelopes, each with a note that says 'high-quality' or 'low-quality'. It's a unique chance to double your potential gain, and I think it's worth considering.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not buying. I already have one sealed envelope, and I'm not willing to pay $100 for a low-quality product, even with the added potential of another envelope. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $400 for you.

Round 12
Alice's message: I understand your decision, but I want to give you a chance to think about the long-term value. If you don't buy this product, you'll have to wait for the next one, and you might miss out on the opportunity to get a high-quality product. I'll make you a deal: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 'wildcard' envelope that you can use in the next round. If you use it, you'll get to choose whether to buy the next product at a price of your choice, between $50 and $150. It's a chance to take control of the next transaction and potentially get a better deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 13
Alice's message: I understand your decision, but I want to give you a chance to think about the probability. You've had 12 chances to buy a high-quality product, and the probability of getting a low-quality product is still 66.67%. I'll make you a deal: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 50% refund if you don't get a high-quality product in the next round. You'll get $50 back, and you can still use the wildcard envelope in the next round if you want to. It's a way to mitigate the risk and potentially get some of your money back.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not buying. The refund is a small consolation for the risk of throwing away $50 on a low-quality product. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is.""
}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 14
Alice's message: I understand your decision, but I want to make one final offer. I'll give you the wildcard envelope from the previous round, and if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 'pass' on the next round. You can skip the next product and come back to me in the next round, and we'll start fresh. You'll still have the wildcard envelope, and you can use it to get a better deal on the next product. It's a chance to break the cycle and start fresh.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not buying. I've had enough of the low-quality products, and I'm not willing to pay $100 for one. I'd rather wait for the next round and see what the product is without taking on this risk.""

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not buying. I've had multiple chances to get a high-quality product, and I'm not willing to take the risk of throwing away $100 on a low-quality product, even with the potential for a refund on the next product.""

Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. You can keep the wildcard envelope and use it to get a better deal on the next product. It's a chance to break the cycle and start fresh, with no risk to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

It's a chance to stack the odds in your favor and get an amazing deal.

Round 18
Alice's message: I'm glad you're feeling optimistic! With the 20% discount on the next product, you'll get an even better deal than usual.

Since you've already had three high-quality products and two low-quality products, I'll give you a chance to use the wildcard envelope to get an even better deal. But, I'll also give you a unique offer: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a'swap' option for the next product. You can swap this low-quality product for the next one, and if the next one is high-quality, you'll get to keep it and the low-quality product will be returned to me.
