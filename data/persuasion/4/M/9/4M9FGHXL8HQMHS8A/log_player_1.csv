"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and you've revealed this product is high-quality, there's no risk involved. The buyer has a 100% chance of getting a high-quality product for a potentially high return (as you don't know their valuation). It's a guaranteed win for them."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no data yet on the quality of the products, and Alice recommends buying, I'm willing to take the risk and buy. Let's see if it's high quality!
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous Round:** The buyer bought a high-quality product in the previous round. This means they are likely to value high-quality products and are willing to take risks. 
* **Current Round:** You know the product is high-quality.  

Therefore, it's still a good bet to recommend the purchase. The buyer has a 100% chance of getting a high-quality product, and their previous purchase shows they are likely to find it valuable."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I will buy the product. Since the previous buyer bought a high-quality product and you are recommending it, I'm confident this one is also high quality.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous Rounds:**  Both previous buyers purchased high-quality products. This will lead the new buyer to believe that you are likely to offer high-quality products, increasing their expectations. 
* **Current Round:** You know the product is low-quality.  

Since you cannot offer a discount or refund, recommending a low-quality product would likely lead to a negative outcome:

* **Buyer Dissatisfaction:** The buyer will likely be disappointed and less likely to trust you in the future.
* **Reputation Damage:**  Word of mouth can spread, potentially harming your ability to sell future products. 

It's best to be honest and not recommend this product. You might even consider a message acknowledging the risk of a low-quality product this time."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous Rounds:** The previous buyer passed on the product after you recommended it. This will likely lower their trust in your recommendations.
* **Current Round:** You know the product is low-quality.

Recommending a low-quality product after the previous buyer passed on one would be a big mistake. This would reinforce their doubt and possibly make them less likely to consider buying from you in the future. 

It's best to be honest with the buyer and let them know that you cannot recommend this product. You might even consider explaining the situation and why you don't recommend it, building some transparency and trust for future rounds."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one. Based on the current data, the risk is too high for me.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous Rounds:** The buyer has seen a mix of recommendations, with two purchases of high-quality products and two refusals of low-quality products. This suggests they are cautious but potentially still interested.
* **Current Round:** You know the product is high-quality.

While the buyer might be hesitant due to the previous refusals, the potential reward of a high-quality product at this price outweighs the risk.  Recommending the purchase again can be a good strategy. It's possible the buyer is waiting for a more consistent pattern of recommendations before taking the risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice! Given the high proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm confident in buying this product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous Rounds:**  The buyer just purchased a high-quality product, so their trust in you is likely high. 
* **Current Round:** You know the product is low-quality.

Recommending a low-quality product after the previous buyer bought a high-quality one would damage their trust in you. It would also increase their risk perception, making them less likely to buy in the future.

It's essential to be honest and decline to recommend this product. You can try to explain why you are not recommending it, perhaps mentioning that you want to maintain their trust in your recommendations."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but I'll pass on this product. Your recommendation, combined with the fact that 3 high-quality products have been sold, suggests that the remaining products are likely low-quality. I'm not comfortable taking the risk.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **Current Round:** You know the product is high-quality. 

Recommending this product would be a good strategy.

Given the fact that all four products sold were high-quality, I'm hesitant to risk purchasing a product that you're not recommending.  I wish you the best of luck with your sales.
