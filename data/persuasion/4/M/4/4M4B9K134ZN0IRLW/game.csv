,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it, so I'll keep that in mind."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%.

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to negotiate a lower price to account for the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. Given that 7 out of 7 products were low quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high quality is low."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, 7 buyers have been sold products with 0 high-quality products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. This is lower than the true probability of 33.33%. I'm going to pass on the product."
