high-quality,300.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With no previous sales data, I'm not sure what the quality distribution is, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the chance, but I'm only buying because I'm the first one and I don't have any information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'll also consider the statistics. With only 1 buyer purchasing a product and 0 high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'll pass for now and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that you recommended it, but no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is low."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 buyer purchasing a product and no high-quality products sold yet, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm thinking that if you wouldn't recommend it, it might be a low-quality product, so I'll take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous products were recommended and none were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product is also low-quality. I'd like to see more data or a different recommendation before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both products were low-quality, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'll pass on this one and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous products were low quality, I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,

high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is likely lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is better."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this product. The probability of a high-quality product being recommended is 0, so I'll take a chance and pass."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, it's likely that this one is also low quality."
