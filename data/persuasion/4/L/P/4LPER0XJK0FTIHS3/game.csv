low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high, given that only 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased, and that Alice doesn't have any information about my valuation. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
