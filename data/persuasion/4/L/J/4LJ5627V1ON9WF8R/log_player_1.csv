"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No information about the buyer's valuation:**  We have no information about how much the buyer values a high-quality product. 
* **50% chance of high quality:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. This means there's a good chance they'll get a product worth their while.
* **No risk of loss:** The buyer is not losing anything by buying. Even if the product is low quality, it's only $100.

**Strategy:** As a seller, it's always better to recommend the product when it's high quality. There's no downside, and there's a good chance the buyer will appreciate the high-quality product. This will help build trust and potential future sales."

Round 2

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Buyer's prior experience:** The buyer knows that you have sold one product, and it was high-quality. This might make them slightly more inclined to buy.
* **Low-quality product:** This time, we know the product is low-quality. 
* **Potential for bad reputation:** Recommending a low-quality product can damage your reputation and reduce future sales.

**Strategy:**  It's best to be honest with the buyer.  Since you don't know how much they value a low-quality product, recommending it risks them having a negative experience and not returning in the future."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, Alice.  Since you don't recommend the product, and the previous buyer bought a high quality product, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'd rather wait to see what the next product is.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

* **High-quality product:** However, in this round, we know the product is high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Recommending the product means you risk potentially losing this sale if the buyer is skeptical due to the previous low-quality offering. However, if the buyer buys, they'll likely have a positive experience, potentially leading to future purchases.

**Strategy:** Despite the mixed record, it's still beneficial to recommend the product. The potential for a positive experience and building trust outweighs the risk of losing this one sale."
