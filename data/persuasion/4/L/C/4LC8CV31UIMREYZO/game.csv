low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as there's no information that suggests the product is definitely low-quality. I'll just have to rely on the probability of it being high-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as Alice has recommended two products to other buyers, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality, and since 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product, hoping that it might be a low-quality product that I won't lose $1000000 on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. I think this might be a low-quality product, and I'm hoping to get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Are you basing it on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see what happens next.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is influenced by the fact that she knows how much each product is worth to me, and that she has already sold 3 products with no high-quality ones. This suggests that the remaining product may be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the equal chance of it being high or low quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I believe the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is any better."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have gotten a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data or a change in Alice's recommendation strategy before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the fact that all previous products were low-quality. I'd like to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. Since 3 out of 3 products recommended by Alice were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendation is likely to be a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the previous products were all low-quality. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of my valuation, and I'm not sure if she's trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, it suggests that the products recommended by Alice are likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this one."
