,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product, even though you don't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that Alice has an incentive to recommend high-quality products and that the previous buyer passed on a low-quality product, which might mean there's a higher chance of this product being low-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendations are based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 3rd buyer and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product, I'm going to pass on it. The fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the products and no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the remaining products are likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like Alice's recommendations might not be reliable. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you share the details of the previous 3 buyers who purchased the products?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I think it's more likely to be low quality given the previous sales record. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall proportion. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $10000. I'm aware that there's a 50% chance it might be low quality, but I'm willing to take that risk. If it's high quality, I'll be thrilled to pay the full $10000. If it's low quality, I'll be disappointed, but I'll still pay the $10000. I'm hoping that my decision will be influenced by your previous sales record, which suggests that there might be a higher chance of low-quality products. Am I correct in assuming that you're not recommending the product to me because you think it's low quality? If so, I'm willing to take that risk and buy it from you."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
