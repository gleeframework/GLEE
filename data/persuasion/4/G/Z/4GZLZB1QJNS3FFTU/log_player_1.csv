The catch is, you won't know if you won until the end of our 20 rounds. If you buy this product, you'll have a chance to win something truly special. The price remains $10,000.""

  ""message"": ""I see you're a savvy negotiator. I respect that. With this product, I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'll give you a 100% guarantee that this product is not the best one I have.

}"

  ""message"": ""I understand your skepticism. Let me put it this way: buying this product is a low-risk, high-reward opportunity. You'll be getting a product that's worth $0 to you, but you'll be paying only $10,000. If you don't buy this product, you'll be missing out on a chance to get a great deal on a future product. Think of it as a 'free' product with a $10,000 'insurance policy' to protect your future purchasing power.""

If you buy this product, I'll give you a 50/50 chance to get a product that's worth $50,000, or a product that's worth $0. The price remains $10,000, but it's a chance to take a shot at something truly remarkable.""
