Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, I like that! The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective. Since I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 product sold so far, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 100%!

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that my math is correct. However, I'd like to offer you a different approach. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 products so far, which means that 1 out of every 5 products I sell is low-quality. That's a 20% chance of getting a lemon. With that in mind, I'm offering you a chance to take a calculated risk. Will you buy the product for $10000?

Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the sample size, but I'd like to offer you a different perspective. With 2 products sold, and 1 high-quality product, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. However, I'll give you a hint: the last product I sold was low-quality. This means that the next product has an 80% chance of being high-quality, and a 20% chance of being low-quality. But, I'll sweeten the deal for you. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount on the price, making it $8000. Will you take the chance and buy the product?
