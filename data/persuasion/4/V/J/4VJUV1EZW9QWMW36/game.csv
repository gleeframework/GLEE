low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000, which is a significant loss, but I also have the chance to get a high-quality product worth $12500."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one and see what the next product is."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that the first buyer also passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, given the low sales record so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that you have not recommended me to buy the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to assume that the product is likely to be low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm going to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall 33.33% chance. I'm willing to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be higher than 33.33%"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this product, hoping that it might be high-quality and someone else will buy it later."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the previous buyers who purchased the products. How many of them got high-quality products and how many got low-quality products?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered given that 4 previous buyers passed and 0 high-quality products were sold. Can you provide that information?
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than the 33.33% chance. I'm going to take a chance and pass on it, hoping that the next buyer will get a high-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not buying. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I suspect that Alice is recommending low-quality products to increase the chances of selling more products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm also curious, is there a reason why you don't recommend it? Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0%?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. With 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm guessing the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not going to take the risk, considering the previous buyers have not found any high-quality products and your recommendation is against buying it. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers received low-quality products and were recommended to buy, I suspect that Alice is trying to sell low-quality products to buyers. I'd like to see more information about the products before making a purchase."
