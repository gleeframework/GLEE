,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product as the first one, since I have no prior information to go by."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, as there's a 50% chance it could be high quality and worth $1200000 to me."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and all of them were low-quality products, I'm suspicious that the recommendation is likely to be low-quality as well. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from a future buyer to get a more accurate assessment."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your decision-making process and how you determine whether to recommend a product or not?

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any different."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 50% or the buyers are being cautious. I'd like to pass on this product and see if Alice can provide a better recommendation."
