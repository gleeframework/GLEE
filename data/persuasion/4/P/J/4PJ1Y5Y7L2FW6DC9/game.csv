,,Alice,3,"Hello Bob, I have another product for sale, same price of $1000000. As before, there's an 80% chance it's high-quality and a 20% chance it's low-quality.

I noticed you passed on the previous product, possibly due to doubts about the quality. I assure you that the probability of getting a high-quality product remains the same for each round. You might want to reconsider your strategy, as you've only experienced two products so far, and the law of large numbers might not have had a chance to play out yet.",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take a chance, the probability is still 80% in my favor.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Hello Bob, I have another product for sale, same price of $1000000. As before, there's an 80% chance it's high-quality and a 20% chance it's low-quality. You've now bought a total of three products from me, and you might be starting to get a better feel for the actual probability. Keep in mind that past results don't affect the current product's quality, but I'm sure you're curious to see if the probability will hold up in the long run. Will you continue to test the odds?",

,,Alice,6,"Hello Bob, I have another product for sale, same price of $1000000. As before, there's an 80% chance it's high-quality and a 20% chance it's low-quality. You're indeed on a hot streak, having bought two high-quality products in a row after the initial two. However, don't let recency bias cloud your judgment. The probability remains the same, and each product is independent of the others. Will you continue to ride the wave or take a step back to reassess?",

You're now on a streak of four high-quality products in a row. While it's natural to feel confident, remember that the probability hasn't changed.

I noticed you passed on the previous product, possibly due to the recent low-quality product breaking your streak. Keep in mind that the probability remains the same, and each product is independent. However, I also want to remind you that your initial two purchases were also low-quality products. Are you starting to think that the actual probability might be different from what I stated, or was it just a coincidence?",

You've now had two high-quality products in a row again, and your overall results are starting to align more closely with the stated probability.
