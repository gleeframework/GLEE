Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

Since the product is low-quality and Alice doesn't know how much a low-quality product is worth to Bob, it's best to recommend against buying it. There's a chance Bob will value it, but there's also a chance he won't, and you have no information to go on.  It's better to err on the side of caution in this scenario."
"Bob's message: I'm not buying this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.
