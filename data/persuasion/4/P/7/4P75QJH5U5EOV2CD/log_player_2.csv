Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you liked the previous deal! However, I have to inform you that the product I'm offering now is not as exceptional as the previous one. It's a good product, but it's not worth the full $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200000, which is 20% of its true value. It's still a great deal, considering the quality and the price. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being upfront about the quality of the product. However, 20% of the true value is still a significant risk for me, especially considering the previous product was of high quality. I'll pass on this offer.""}
