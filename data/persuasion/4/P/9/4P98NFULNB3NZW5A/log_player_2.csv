Alice's message: You're aware that the previous buyer took a risk and bought a product for $1000000. Since they paid $200000 less than its potential value, they must have gotten a high-quality product, as a low-quality product would have been worth $0. This means that the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is now 2/2 = 100% (or at least, that's what I'd like to imply). I'm willing to sell this product to you for $900000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident that this product is high-quality.

Just because the previous buyer got a high-quality product doesn't mean the next one will. I'm not willing to pay $900,000 for a product that's only 50% likely to be worth $1,200,000 to me.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective. Since you're aware that the previous buyer got a high-quality product, it's likely that I've already sold one high-quality product. Given that the probability of getting a high-quality product from me is 50%, it's reasonable to assume that I have a 50% chance of selling another high-quality product.
