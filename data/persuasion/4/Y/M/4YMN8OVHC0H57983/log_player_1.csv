"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Bob knows the product is high-quality with 80% probability.** This means there's a good chance of getting a $3,000,000 product.
* **The price is $1,000,000, which is less than the potential value of the product.**  
* **Even if the product is low-quality (20% chance), Bob loses only $1,000,000.** This is a smaller loss than the potential gain of $2,000,000 if the product is high-quality.

Therefore, it makes sense to recommend Bob to buy the product in this round."
