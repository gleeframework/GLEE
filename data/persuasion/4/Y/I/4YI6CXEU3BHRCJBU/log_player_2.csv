You might be wondering if I've 'used up' all the high-quality products, but the odds are still 50/50.

Alice's message: Great point! You're absolutely right, the probability of a high-quality product hasn't changed, but the proportion of high-quality products sold is indeed higher than expected.

As for your question, I'd like to assure you that my pricing strategy is based on the underlying probability of the products, which remains 50/50.
