,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because you're concerned that this product might be low-quality?"

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total products sold so far?"

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know how many low-quality products have been sold so far. Is it possible to get that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 6 buyers didn't find the product valuable, but I'm willing to take the risk. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to pay $10000 for it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of the lack of recommendations from previous buyers. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 7, the probability of this product being high-quality is likely low. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products Alice is offering are more likely to be low quality, and I don't want to risk wasting $10000 on a product worth $0 to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers received low-quality products, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is higher than the observed 0/9. I'd like to take a chance that the next product might be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 9 out of 9 products sold so far were low-quality, it's likely that Alice's recommendation is based on the product being low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm going to pass on it. I'm assuming you would only recommend a high-quality product if you had a good reason to believe it is high-quality. With 9 buyers passing on the product and none of them buying it, it suggests that all 9 products were low-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's likely that this product is also low-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
