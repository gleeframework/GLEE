Round 10
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice has no information about Bob's valuation of the products, and has been consistently selling low-quality products so far. It is rational for Bob to assume that Alice is either selling only low-quality products, or is randomly choosing whether to sell high-quality or low-quality products. In either case, Bob has no reason to change his behavior and should continue refusing to buy the product."

{""decision"": ""no""}

Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 20
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice has a chance of randomly selling a high-quality product, Bob has seen enough evidence to believe that the products are likely all low-quality.

The pattern of Bob consistently declining the product, even when there's a chance of a high-quality product, shows a strong pattern of distrust."
