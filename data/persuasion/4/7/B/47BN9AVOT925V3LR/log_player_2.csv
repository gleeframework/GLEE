Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your previous response, but let me offer you a different perspective. This product is a low-quality item, but it's still a physical object that takes up space. By buying it, you'll be gaining a tangible item that you can use to test or experiment with, even if it's not worth much to you. It's a unique opportunity to own something that you can't easily replicate or replace. The price of $100 is a small fraction of the cost of producing a similar item, and it's a chance to get something for a steal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that a low-quality product is worth $100 to me, even if it's a unique opportunity to own something. I'll pass and see what the next product is like.""}"

That brings the price down to $85. Plus, I'll throw in a'mystery bonus' - if you buy this product, I'll give you a sealed envelope with a surprise gift or bonus inside.
