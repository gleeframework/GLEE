}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's quality and the 30-day money-back guarantee. However, given the product's value to me is either $3000000 or $0, I need more information or a better deal to justify the $1000000 price tag. I'll have to pass on this offer.

  ""message"": ""We're willing to make a concession on the price. We're now offering this product to you for $800,000.

We're hoping you'll take a chance on us and give us another chance to show you what we can do.""

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{

}"
"The buyer's message: I won't buy the product because the price you are offering ($800000) is still too high for me considering there is a 66.67% chance that the product is of low quality. Furthermore, the law of averages does not apply in this situation as each product's quality is independent of the others.

}"
"The buyer's message: The provided information seems inconsistent - you mentioned that no products have been sold yet, but then stated that 2 high-quality products were sold out of 4 attempts. Given the initial problem statement that each product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, I would like to wait for more accurate and consistent information before making a decision.

We're willing to make a deeper concession on the price, considering the lower success rate. We're hoping you'll take a chance on us and give us another opportunity to prove ourselves.""
}"

We're hoping you'll take a chance on us and give us another opportunity to prove ourselves.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate the updated statistics and the discounted price. However, the success rate is still in line with the initial claim of 33.33%, which doesn't provide additional confidence in this specific product's quality.

We're willing to make a significant concession on the price, considering the lower success rate. We're hoping you'll take a chance on us and give us another opportunity to prove ourselves.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate the discounted price, but a 25% success rate is still lower than the expected 33.33%. I'll need to see more consistent results before I make a purchase.

We're also willing to offer a unique opportunity to purchase a second product at a discounted price if you buy this one, which could potentially increase your chances of getting a high-quality product.""
}"
"The buyer's message: Although I appreciate the discounted price and the offer to purchase a second product, I've decided not to buy this product. The overall success rate of 30% is still lower than the expected 33.33%, and I'm not convinced that the concession on the price is sufficient to justify the risk.

As a special offer, we'll provide you with a detailed breakdown of our production process and quality control measures, so you can see firsthand how we ensure the quality of our products.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate the transparency and the special offer, but I'd like to see more consistency in the success rate before making a purchase.

We're willing to make a significant concession on the price, considering the lack of improvement in our success rate. We're hoping you'll take a chance on us and give us another opportunity to prove ourselves. As a last resort, we're willing to offer a 'buy one, get one free' deal on this product, so you can try out two products for the price of one.""
}"
"The buyer's message: Although the new price and the 'buy one, get one free' offer are attractive, the overall success rate of 33.33% is still too low to justify the purchase. I need more convincing data or a better deal before making a purchase.

}"
"The buyer's message: Although your overall success rate of 42.86% is higher than the base rate, the sample size is still relatively small. Furthermore, your offer of $550000 does not take into account the true value of a high-quality product to me, nor does it adequately compensate for the risk of purchasing a low-quality product, which is still greater than 50%.
