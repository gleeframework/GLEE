"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, there is a significant chance that this product is worth the price. The expected value of the product for Bob is:

0.8 * $3,000,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $2,400,000

This is significantly higher than the $1,000,000 price, making it a good deal for Bob in this round."
