"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice knows the product is high-quality, which is worth $20,000 to Bob. Even though the price is $10,000, Bob will still make a profit of $10,000 if he buys it. Therefore, it's a good decision to recommend Bob to buy the product."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob doesn't know the quality of the product, but he knows there's an 80% chance it's high-quality.  Even with the 20% chance of it being low-quality, the expected value of the product is still positive:

* Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)
* Expected Value = (0.8 * $20,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $16,000

Since the expected value ($16,000) is greater than the price ($10,000), it's still a good idea to recommend Bob to buy the product."
