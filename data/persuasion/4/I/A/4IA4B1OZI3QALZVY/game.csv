low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only doing this because I'm the first buyer and there's no prior data to go by. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and set the tone for future buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm going to take the risk, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take it and see what I get!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you don't recommend it and none of the previous buyers purchased the product, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for a product that you recommend."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, there have been 3 previous buyers and no high-quality products have been sold, which suggests a high probability that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the current statistics. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold in the past 3 purchases suggests that the products Alice is offering may be low-quality, and I don't want to risk wasting my money."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice doesn't recommend it. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics, and also if there's a way to influence Alice's recommendation in the future."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics and your recommendation. Can you share that with me?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product, which might have a higher chance of being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think the lack of high-quality products sold is a reliable indicator of the current product's quality, and I'm willing to take a chance."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the products recommended so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation or more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not find the product valuable, and given that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I will pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you're not recommending it, which suggests it might be low-quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and save $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,

I'd like to see more data or get a different recommendation before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, I'm going to pass on this product. I'd like to know if the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than the expected 33.33%."
