"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you don't have any information about the product's quality, and it's a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality, it's a gamble worth taking.  A high-quality product is worth more than the price, and even if it's low quality, you only lose the $100."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate you letting me know, but I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll trust your judgment.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a signal.  Since she knows the value of the product, her recommendation not to buy suggests it's likely low quality.  While it's possible she's wrong, the risk of getting a worthless product outweighs the potential reward of a high-quality one."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's recommendation isn't perfect (she was wrong in round 2), it's still useful information. It's likely that she's recommending products she believes are high quality, and she has more information than you do.  The potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of another low-quality one."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```
