,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know your reasoning for not recommending it to me. Is it because you think it's low quality or because you think it's high quality but you don't want to sell it to me?"

high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality.

,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by your recommendation given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,I strongly recommend buying this product. I have confidence in its quality.
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality and not worth $100 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"I want to be transparent with you, 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, but I assure you that this product is of high-quality. I strongly recommend buying it, it's a rare opportunity."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since no high-quality products have been sold yet, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"I understand the concerns about my previous recommendations. I want to assure you that this product is genuinely high-quality. Out of the 12 previous products, 4 were purchased, and unfortunately, none of them were high-quality. However, I've had 4 high-quality products out of the 12, and this one is one of them. I strongly recommend buying it, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, I think it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer will be more confident in their decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,"I don't recommend buying this product. I've had a mix of high and low-quality products, and I can assure you that this one is not worth the $100 price tag."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
