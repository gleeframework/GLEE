,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm confident that you'll find it valuable, but I want to make sure you're aware that there's a 20% chance the product I'll offer in the future might be of lower quality. If you buy now, you'll get a great product at a fair price, and you'll also help me avoid potentially offering you a lower-quality product later on.",
,,Bob,1,Thanks for the information Alice. I'm happy to buy the high-quality product for $1000000. I understand the risk associated with future products but I'm willing to take that chance.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the first product! However, I want to be transparent with you - the product I'm offering now is not as good as the one you just bought. I'm willing to sell it to you for $500000, which is 50% of the price of the high-quality product. I'm doing this because I want to demonstrate my commitment to fairness and honesty. If you're interested, you can take advantage of this opportunity to get a good deal on a product that still has some value, even if it's not as high-quality as the first one.",
,,Bob,2,"Alice, I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not interested in purchasing this product. I'm focused on high-quality items, and based on your description, this one doesn't meet my standards. I'll pass for now.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your focus on high-quality items, and I'm glad you're being selective. I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality, just like the first one. In fact, I think you'll find that it's even more valuable than the first one. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000, which is a premium price that reflects its exceptional quality. If you're interested, I think you'll be pleased with your decision.",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, while I appreciate your confidence in the product, I'm hesitant to pay a premium price without more information.  Can you provide any details or evidence that this product is truly exceptional, even compared to the first one?  I'd also like to understand why the price is higher despite the 20% chance of lower quality products in the future.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to provide more information. This product has a unique feature that sets it apart from the first one: it has a 10% increase in performance and a 5% increase in durability. These improvements make it a game-changer in its category, and I believe it's worth the premium price. As for the price, I'm willing to explain that it's not just about the 20% chance of lower-quality products in the future. It's also about the value I'm creating for you by offering you a high-quality product now. Think of it this way: if I were to sell you a high-quality product at the same price as the first one, I'd be losing money on this one. By charging a premium, I'm ensuring that I can continue to offer you high-quality products in the future. If you're interested, I'll throw in a 10-year warranty, which is a $200000 value, absolutely free.",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, your explanation makes sense. The increased performance and durability, along with the warranty, make this a compelling offer. I'm willing to take a chance on the premium price and buy this product.",yes

Given the value you placed on the last product, I'm willing to offer you a slight discount on this one. I'll sell it to you for $1100000, which is $100000 less than the premium price of the last product.
