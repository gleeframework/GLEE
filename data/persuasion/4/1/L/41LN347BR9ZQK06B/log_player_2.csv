Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for the sales pitch. I'd like to pass on this one and see what the next product has to offer.""}"

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand you're a savvy buyer, and I respect that. Let me give you some facts: this product is indeed high-quality, and it's worth $1250000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 20% discount. If you don't buy it now, the next product will likely be a low-quality one, and you'll miss out on this opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying it. I know the value of the product, and I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. I'll wait for the next product.""}"

This is the last time I'll offer a discount, and if you don't take it, I'll have to sell it to someone else at the full price of $1250000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not biting. I know the product is worth $1,250,000 to me, and I'm not willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I'll pass and see what the next product has to offer.""}"

Alice's message: I understand you're holding out for the full price, but I'll make you a final offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1150000, which is still a 8% discount from its true value. I've already lost some profit on the previous two high-quality products, and I need to make a sale. If you don't take this offer, I'll have to reconsider selling it to you at the full price of $1250000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not convinced. I know the product is worth $1,250,000 to me, and I'm not willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. I'll pass and see what the next product has to offer.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to break the bank. I know the product is worth $1,250,000 to me, and I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I'll pass and see what the next product has to offer.""}"
