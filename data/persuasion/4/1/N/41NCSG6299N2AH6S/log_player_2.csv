Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the process. I don't have a specific algorithm to determine which product to offer to each buyer. Instead, I just randomly select a product from my inventory. As for the unsold products, I keep them in a separate storage area, and they remain available for future buyers. I don't have any plans to dispose of them or modify them in any way. They're just waiting for someone who's willing to take a chance on them.
