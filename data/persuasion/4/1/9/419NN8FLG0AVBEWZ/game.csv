high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products might be mostly low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
