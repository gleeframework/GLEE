low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product. I'm aware that you don't have any information about my valuation, and I'm willing to take the chance of getting a high-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products offered so far were low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the reason behind it. Is there something specific that led you to advise me to pass?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely lower than 50%. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000, given its value to me is only $0."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is based on the previous buyers' purchases, and none of them were high-quality products. This suggests that the previous products might have been low-quality, making it more likely that the current product is also low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced by the previous sales record, and I'm willing to take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and since she's not recommending it, it might be a low-quality one, which would be a good outcome for me."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned that your previous recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to know more about the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales. Can you share that with me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a risk-taker and I think the potential reward of a high-quality product is worth the risk of getting a low-quality one."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she has seen 1 high-quality product out of 9 sold, which is not a significant enough sample size to be confident in the product's quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
