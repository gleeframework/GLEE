"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you don't know the buyer's valuation for high-quality or low-quality products, and there's a 50% chance of the product being high-quality, it's a gamble. However, there's no information suggesting the buyer has any reason to suspect the product is low-quality. Therefore, recommending the purchase in this scenario is the best strategy."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take a chance and buy the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

In Round 1, the buyer bought a high-quality product. However, this doesn't provide any information about your trustworthiness or the quality of this round's product.  Since you know this round's product is low-quality, and you don't know the buyer's valuation for low-quality products, it's highly unlikely that the buyer would find the product worth $100. Therefore, recommending the purchase is risky and not advisable."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. I'll pass on this product. Based on the current data, the risk of a low-quality product is too high for me.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer is now aware of your past selling history: 

* You sold one high-quality product.
* You offered one low-quality product, which the buyer declined. 

This means the buyer likely sees you as a 50/50 proposition, with no reason to trust you more than chance. Since this round's product is low-quality, recommending it carries a high risk of the buyer not finding it worthwhile. Therefore, it's best to decline the recommendation."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the information I have, I'm going to pass on this product. I'll see what you have to offer next time.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer is becoming increasingly cautious.  They have now seen:

* One high-quality product sold.
* Two low-quality products offered and declined.

This strengthens the buyer's perception of you as unreliable.  Since this round's product is again low-quality, recommending it is very likely to result in the buyer declining."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Since you don't recommend the product, I'll pass. Based on the limited data, it seems like the odds are not in my favor.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

```

* One high-quality product sold.
* Three low-quality products offered and declined.

This pattern strongly suggests that you are more likely to offer low-quality products.  Since this round's product is again low-quality, recommending it is highly likely to result in the buyer declining."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I'm going to pass on this one. Based on the limited data available, it seems like the product may be more likely to be low quality. I'd prefer to wait and see if more information becomes available.
