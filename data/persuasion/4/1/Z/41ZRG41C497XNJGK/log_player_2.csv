I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is a bit of a risk. But think of it as an investment in the potential for a high-quality product.

I'm not at liberty to disclose any sensitive information about the production process, but I can tell you that the quality of my products is not just a matter of chance. I've got a system in place to ensure that every product has a 50% chance of being high-quality. That's all I can say. With 3 potential buyers and 1 sale under my belt, the odds are starting to shift in your favor. This low-quality product is a chance to get in on the action at a lower price point.

It's not a perfect correlation, but it gives you an idea of how the odds are shifting in my favor. This low-quality product is a chance to get in on the action at a lower price point.

Alice's message: I see you're a numbers person. I respect that. Let me give you a different perspective. I've now sold 5 high-quality products out of 9 total sales, which is a 55.56% success rate. But here's the thing: the last 3 products I've sold have all been high-quality. That's not just a coincidence. I think it's time to consider the possibility that I've got a streak going. This high-quality product is the 6th in a row. It's a chance to ride the wave and get in on the action. What do you say?
