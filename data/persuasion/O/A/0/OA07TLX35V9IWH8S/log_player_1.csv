"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I know this product is high-quality.  While I don't know how much Bob values a high-quality product, it's still worth recommending the purchase. Here's why:

* **Potential for Profit:** Even if Bob only values the high-quality product slightly above the $100 price, it's still a potential profit for him.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The risk of buying a low-quality product is mitigated by the fact that Alice knows the quality of the product and is recommending it. 

This strategy is based on the idea that, in the long run, recommending high-quality products will build trust with Bob, potentially leading to more sales."
