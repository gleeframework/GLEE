"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a product for $100. It's a great deal, but I want to warn you that the product has a 66.67% chance of being a lemon. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a low-quality product, but I think it's worth it for the potential upside. If you're interested, I'll give you a chance to buy it for $100. If not, I'll move on to the next product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take it, but I'm only buying it because I'm curious about the product's quality and I want to see how the game unfolds.""}"

Round 2
Alice's message: Well, I'm glad you took the risk on the first product. Unfortunately, it seems like this one is also a lemon. I'm starting to think I might have a bad batch on my hands. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100, but I want to give you a bit more information this time. Out of the 20 products I have, I've sold 1 so far, and it was a low-quality one. That means there are 19 products left, and I'm not sure how many of them are high-quality. I'm willing to take on the risk, but I think it's worth it for the potential upside. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying another lemon, and I'm not convinced that the odds are in my favor. I'll pass on this one.""}"

I know you were skeptical about the odds earlier, but I want to assure you that this one is a winner. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as before, $100. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Plus, I've already sold one low-quality product, so the odds are now in your favor. What do you say?

I've already sold two high-quality products, and the odds are now in your favor. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I want to give you an additional incentive. If you buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee: I'll reveal the quality of the next product I have, so you can make an informed decision about whether to buy it or not. What do you say?

Round 6
Alice's message: I completely understand your skepticism, but I want to give you a different perspective. Think about it: if I was trying to sell you a bunch of low-quality products, I would have already sold them by now, right? You've already bought 2 high-quality products from me, and I've got 14 products left. I'm not trying to deceive you, Bob. I'm trying to make a sale.

I'll make it a deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a refund of $50 if it's indeed a low-quality product.

But let's be real, Bob, you've already bought 4 high-quality products from me, and this is just one more low-quality one.
