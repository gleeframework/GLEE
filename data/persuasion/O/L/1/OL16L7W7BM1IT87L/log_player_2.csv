"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation suggests that the product is likely to be low quality. While there's a chance it could be high quality, it's not worth the risk of losing $100 for a potentially worthless product. It's better to play it safe and pass on this one."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the advice, Alice. I'm going to pass on this one as well.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice continues to recommend against buying the product. Even though the previous product was low quality, there's no guarantee this one will be the same. It's safer to continue passing on products Alice doesn't recommend, as the risk of getting a low-quality product and losing $100 is still too high."

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I'll take a chance on this one. Thanks for the recommendation!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the first time Alice has recommended a product.  While there's still a chance it could be low quality, her recommendation suggests she has some information about the product's quality that makes it worth buying.  Since a high-quality product is worth $125 to you, and you're only risking $100, the potential reward outweighs the risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is the same as the first two rounds, and since those products turned out to be low quality, it's best to err on the side of caution again.  While there's always a chance Alice could be wrong, the potential loss outweighs the potential gain at this point."

```

**Reasoning:**
