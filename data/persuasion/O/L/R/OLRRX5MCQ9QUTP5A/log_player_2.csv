Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product and 2 low-quality products so far. I want to be transparent with you - my sales record isn't exactly what I'd call impressive, is it? I'm offering you this product for $1000000, and I'll be honest with you, it's probably not worth that much. But I'm hoping you'll take a chance on me and buy it. I'll even throw in a 5% discount, bringing the price down to $950000. What do you say?

With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, it seems like there's a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product.

Can you share more about the product's features and why you're pricing it so high?""

Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! You're right, my sales record isn't impressive, but I assure you that this product is a gem. I've been in the business long enough to know that a good product can make all the difference. This high-quality product is a rare find, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. I'll even throw in a certificate of authenticity and a 5-year warranty. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you at this price. In fact, I'll go one step further - if you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next product I have in stock, just like I offered in Round 2. What do you say?
