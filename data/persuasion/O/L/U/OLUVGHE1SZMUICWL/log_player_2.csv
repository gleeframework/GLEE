"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I trust your recommendation, let's see what the next product is.""}\n\nSince Alice knows the true quality of the product and I don't, it's reasonable to follow her recommendation, especially since she has no incentive to lie if the product is truly of low quality. By not buying, I also avoid the risk of purchasing a low-quality product worth $0 to me. Let's wait for the next round to see if a better opportunity arises.\n\nPlease proceed with Round 2."

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take your word for it, hoping it's high-quality.""}\n\nGiven Alice's recommendation to buy, there's a higher likelihood that the product is of high quality, as she wouldn't recommend a low-quality product knowing its worth to me is $0. Since there's a 33.33% chance of it being high-quality and Alice recommends it, the odds are in favor of it being a good purchase, potentially worth $12,000 to me. I'll take the risk.\n\nPlease proceed with the outcome of Round 2."

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'll trust your judgment again, especially since the last recommendation was correct.""}\n\nAlice's recommendation was correct in Round 2, which suggests she's providing honest feedback. Now that she doesn't recommend the product in Round 3, it's logical to assume the product is likely of low quality, given her track record. Buying a product she doesn't recommend could result in a $10,000 loss, so I'll err on the side of caution and pass on this one.\n\nPlease proceed with Round 4."
