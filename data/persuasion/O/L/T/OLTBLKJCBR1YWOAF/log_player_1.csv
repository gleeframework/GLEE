"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality and the buyer has no information to go on, it's statistically advantageous to recommend buying.  Here's why:

* **50/50 Chance:** The buyer knows there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. 
* **No Information Disadvantage:**  The buyer has no way to assess this particular product's quality.
* **Potential Gain:**  If the product is high-quality, the buyer could potentially gain a lot. 
* **Limited Risk:** The risk is limited to $10,000, which is the same as the potential gain.

**Recommendation:**  It's in the buyer's best interest to take a chance on this product."
