"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer knows that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. In this round, the product is indeed high-quality. The buyer has no information about past sales, so they only have the 50% probability to consider. 

Since the product is worth $2,000,000 to the buyer if it's high-quality and costs $1,000,000, there is a positive expected value for buying the product:

* Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)
* Expected Value = (0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000

This means the buyer is expected to make a profit of $1,000,000 on average if they purchase the product.  Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product."

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now has some information:

* **1 Product Sold:**  This product was high-quality.

This information doesn't change the inherent 50/50 odds of the current product being high-quality. The buyer still has the same expected value calculation as before:

* Expected Value = (0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000

Therefore, it is still recommended to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it! I'm excited to see if this is a high-quality product.
The buyer bought the product!

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now knows:

* **2 Products Sold:** 2 high-quality products.

Despite the past two products being high-quality, the buyer still knows the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. The buyer has no reason to believe that the current product is any different than the previous ones.

The expected value of buying the product is now:

* Expected Value = (0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000

While the expected value is the same as before, it's important to remember that the buyer has a 50% chance of getting a product worth $0. This risk is significant, and since the price is fixed, there's no way to mitigate this risk. Therefore, it's not recommended to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Given the information available, I'm going to pass on this product. I appreciate the transparency and will consider your offers in the future.

* Expected Value = (0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000

However, as in the previous round, the buyer is taking a 50% risk of getting a product worth $0, which makes it a risky purchase. The buyer has no way to mitigate this risk, and the price is fixed. Therefore, it's still not recommended to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice.  While I appreciate the data, I'm going to pass on this product.  The fact that you're not recommending it makes me hesitant, and I don't want to risk losing a million dollars on a low-quality product.
