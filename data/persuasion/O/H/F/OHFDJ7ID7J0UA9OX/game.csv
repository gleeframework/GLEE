high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that I'm the second buyer, and she doesn't have any information about the quality of the product yet. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the statistics on the product you're offering me. How many high-quality products have been offered to buyers so far, and how many low-quality products have been offered?"

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm hesitant to buy the product after seeing the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass and see if the next product is any better.

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and I've seen that none of the previous buyers who got a recommendation to buy ended up purchasing a high-quality product. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, and Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be based on any knowledge of the product's quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both products were low quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendation is based on the product being low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my own analysis rather than Alice's recommendation.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for another opportunity or see if the recommendation changes in the future."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you provide the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far?

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation. This suggests that all previous products were low-quality, which means the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 buyers have been recommended to buy the product and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the products recommended to buy are likely to be low-quality. I will pass on the product."
