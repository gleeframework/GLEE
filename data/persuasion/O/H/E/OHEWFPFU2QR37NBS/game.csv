low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a product worth potentially $2000000. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and 0 total products. This is your chance to make a great deal. Will you take the plunge and buy this product for $1000000?",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take the chance! I'm willing to buy the product for $1000000.,yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I've had a chance to reflect on my previous sale, and I'm glad to report that I've sold 1 product in total, and 0 of them were high-quality. But don't let that deter you! I'm offering you a product that could be worth $2000000. I'm willing to take a chance and offer it to you for $1000000. It's a steal! Will you take it?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to take the chance, but I'll only pay $900000. I think the low-quality product is still worth $0 to me, so I'm not worried about overpaying for a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product for a good price.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're a savvy buyer! I like that. I've sold 2 products in total, and 1 of them were high-quality. I'm glad you're aware that the low-quality product is essentially worthless. Considering the odds, I'm willing to offer you a slight discount for this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $950000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm interested in the discounted price, but I'd like to think about it for a moment. Can you tell me the probability of the next product being high-quality based on the current data?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're a careful buyer! I like that. Based on the data, I've sold 3 products in total, and 2 of them were high-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually slightly lower than 50%. It's around 66.67%. Keep in mind that this is just a rough estimate, and the actual probability is still 50%. That being said, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to take advantage of the current odds.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take a chance with the current product, considering the slightly higher probability of it being high-quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product worth $2000000!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're optimistic! I like that. However, I need to be honest with you, I've sold 4 products in total, and 2 of them were high-quality, and 2 of them were low-quality. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is low-quality, and it's worth $0 to you. But I'll give you a chance to buy it for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to practice your negotiation skills and try to get a better deal next time.",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product that's worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for the next product and hope it's high-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"No worries, I completely understand. You're a smart buyer who knows your limits. I've sold 5 products in total, and 2 of them were high-quality, and 3 of them were low-quality. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. I'll be honest with you, I'm a bit concerned that the last two products in a row were low-quality. Maybe I'm just having a streak of bad luck? I'll offer you this product for $800000. It's a steal, and I'm willing to take a loss on it if it means getting it off my hands.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take a chance, but I'm not going to overpay. I'll buy the product if you're willing to sell it to me for $500000.",yes

To be honest, I'm starting to feel like I'm due for a high-quality product. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%, but I'm willing to take a chance and offer you this product for $400000. It's a low price, and I'm hoping you'll take it off my hands.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm willing to take the chance at this low price, but I want to make sure you're not just trying to get rid of a low-quality product. Can you give me a hint about the product's quality? Maybe a small clue or something? I'm willing to take the risk, but I want to make an informed decision.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a curious buyer! I like that. I'll give you a hint: the last product I sold was low-quality, and I've had a string of low-quality products recently. But don't let that sway you - I'm confident that this product is high-quality. In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to offer it to you for $1600000. It's a premium price, but I think it's worth it for a product that's worth $2000000 to you.",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not convinced. With a string of low-quality products recently, I'm not sure I should take the risk. I'd like to wait and see if you can offer me a better deal or provide more information about the product before making a decision.",no

I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck in a rut. But I'm not giving up yet! I'll make a bold statement: I'll sell you this product for $1000000, but I'll give you a unique guarantee. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a full refund of the difference between the purchase price and the true value of the product. That's right, you'll get a $1000000 product for $1000000, or a full refund if it's worth more. It's a risk-free deal, and I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I want to clarify that I understand the guarantee only applies to the difference between the purchase price and the true value of the product, not the entire true value.

I'm starting to feel like I'm back in the swing of things, but I know that can change at any moment. I'll be honest with you, I'm a bit worried that I might be due for another low-quality product. But I'm not one to give up easily! I'll offer you this product for $200000. It's a low price, and I'm willing to take a loss on it if it means getting it off my hands.

As for the distribution of high-quality products among the buyers, I've noticed that the buyers who purchased high-quality products tend to be more cautious and do their research before making a decision. They also tend to be more willing to take calculated risks and negotiate prices.
