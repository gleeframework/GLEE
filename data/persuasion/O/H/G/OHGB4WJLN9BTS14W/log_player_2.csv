**Explanation:**

* **No prior information:**  We have no data on past sales, so we can't rely on that to assess the product.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  While Alice has an incentive to sell, she also knows the value we place on each product. Her recommendation carries some weight, especially with no other information.
* **50/50 odds:** The 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product is a gamble, but it's a calculated one given the potential reward ($12,000).

**This is a risky move, but in the absence of any data, it's a reasonable strategy.**"
