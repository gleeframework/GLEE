,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's lack of recommendation, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. With 2 buyers having passed on the products and no high-quality products sold, it suggests that the products might be mostly low-quality.

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. I'm concerned that this might be a biased sample, and the true proportion of high-quality products might be higher than what I'm seeing. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
