low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm going in blind, but I'll take the risk. I'm willing to pay $100 for the chance to get a $300 product!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the lack of sales and the lack of high-quality products sold might indicate that the products are mostly low-quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when I know it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's low-quality and I can get it for $100, which is a good deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product, and the low sales record, I'm inclined to think the product is likely low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy, and that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products is likely low. I'll pass on this product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that you haven't sold any high-quality products and recommended against the product, I'm going to assume that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it to see if the next buyer will be more optimistic or if the product will be discarded."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have been discouraged from buying, I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low sales record or something else?

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that you haven't recommended any high-quality products to the previous 5 buyers, I'm assuming the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
