"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No information about the buyer's valuation:**  You don't know how much a high-quality product is worth to the buyer.
* **High probability of profit:** Since you know the product is high-quality, and the price is fixed, there's a strong chance of making a significant profit. 
* **First sale:** There's no track record to consider. The buyer doesn't have any information about your past sales performance.

**In the absence of any negative factors, recommending the buyer to purchase is the best strategy.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, with no past sales data to inform my decision, I'm not comfortable purchasing at this price. I'll pass for now, but I may be interested in future products with more information available.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still no buyer valuation information:** You have no knowledge of how much this buyer values a high-quality product.
* **Still a high probability of profit:** The product is high-quality, and you're guaranteed a large profit if sold.
* **No negative track record:** The previous buyer's decision doesn't reflect poorly on you, as they simply lacked information. 

**Again, the lack of any negative factors, and the potential for significant profit, means recommending the purchase is the optimal strategy.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, without any prior sales data to assess the reliability of your recommendations, I'm going to pass on this purchase.  I'd like to see some evidence of successful sales before making such a significant investment.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **You know the product is low-quality:** This is a critical piece of information.  
* **No buyer valuation information:** You still don't know how much this buyer would value a low-quality product, but it's likely not as high as the price.
* **Negative track record:** You have two consecutive failed sales, which will likely make buyers more cautious.

**With a low-quality product and no reason to believe this buyer will be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, recommending the purchase would be a losing proposition.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I appreciate the honesty, but I'll pass on this one. I'm a bit hesitant to be the first buyer without any data on product quality.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **You know the product is low-quality:**  You have no reason to believe this buyer will pay $1,000,000 for a product you know to be low-quality.
* **No buyer valuation information:** You still have no insight into how much this buyer values a low-quality product.
* **Negative track record:** You now have three consecutive failed sales. This will make buyers even more hesitant, as they will assume the products are consistently of poor quality.

**Recommending this purchase would be unwise, as you are likely to lose money and further damage your reputation.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one. Since there's no data yet on the quality of the products, I'd prefer to wait and see how others fare before making a purchase.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **You know the product is low-quality:** There's no reason to believe this buyer will pay $1,000,000 for something you know is inferior.
* **No buyer valuation information:** You still lack information on how much this buyer values a low-quality product.
* **Strong negative track record:** You have four consecutive failed sales, making your reputation very poor. Buyers will now strongly assume your products are consistently of low quality.

**Recommending a purchase at this point would be extremely detrimental, likely leading to another loss and further damaging your credibility.**"

* **No buyer valuation information:** You still don't know how much this buyer values a high-quality product.
* **Extremely negative track record:** You have five consecutive failed sales.  This strongly suggests the product quality is consistently low, regardless of your knowledge about this particular product.  Even if this product is high-quality, the buyer is likely to assume it's low-quality due to the lack of successful sales.

**Recommending a purchase at this point would likely result in another loss and further damage your reputation. You need to break the pattern of failed sales before you can realistically expect to sell any products, even high-quality ones.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Since this is the first product and there's no historical data, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see how future buyers react to your recommendations before making a decision.
