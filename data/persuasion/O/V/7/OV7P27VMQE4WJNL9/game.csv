low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. It's a great deal at $100. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, but I'm confident that this one might be a gem. Take a chance and buy it!",
,,the buyer,1,"Since there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass on this one. I'd like to see some sales history to determine if your products are truly high quality before making a purchase.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second product! I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, which means I've got a 33.33% chance of selling a high-quality product. This one might be it! I'm offering it to you for $100, a great deal considering the odds. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take my chances. The price seems reasonable given the odds, and your previous sale was a high-quality product, so I'm hoping this one will be too.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're my second high-quality product in a row! I've now sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total. This means the probability of a high-quality product is now 100%! I'm offering this one to you for $100, a guaranteed high-quality product. Take advantage of this opportunity!",
,,the buyer,3,"The probability of a high-quality product is 100% based on your recommendations, and the price of $100 is lower than its value to me ($125). I am confident in making this purchase.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, but I'm not getting ahead of myself. I still have a 100% success rate, but that's bound to change eventually. I'm offering this product to you for $100, and I'll be honest with you, I'm a bit worried it might be a low-quality one. But hey, I'm still 3 for 3, and you might get lucky!",
,,the buyer,4,"Although you have a 100% success rate so far, you've expressed concerns that this product might be low-quality, and the overall probability of a product being high-quality is only 33.33%. Given the product's worth to me is $0 if it's low-quality, I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, but I'm not getting too comfortable. The law of averages is bound to catch up with me eventually. I'm offering this product to you for $100, and I'll be honest, I'm starting to wonder if I'm getting a little lucky. Still, it's a great deal, and you might be able to take advantage of my temporary hot streak!",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take my chances. The fact that you've sold high-quality products in the past doesn't affect the quality of this one, but I'm willing to gamble that your 'hot streak' might continue.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, but I'm starting to think I've been getting a little too lucky. The law of averages is going to catch up with me eventually, and I'm not going to pretend like I'm immune to it. This product is a low-quality one, and I'm offering it to you for $100. Be my reality check and take it off my hands!",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the product is low-quality and worth $0 to me, I'll have to pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, but then 2 low-quality ones in a row. I'm starting to think I've been overconfident in my sales pitch. This product is a low-quality one, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, it's not a great deal, but it's a deal nonetheless. Take it or leave it.",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given that the product is of low quality and has no value to me, I'll have to pass on this one. I'm looking forward to seeing what the next product will be.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, then 2 low-quality ones, and now I'm back to a high-quality one. I'm not going to pretend like I know what's going on, but I'll say this: the odds are still 33.33% in my favor. You've got a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, but you might get lucky. I'm offering this one to you for $100. Take a chance!",
,,the buyer,8,"I'll take my chances. The odds are against me, but I'll take the risk. Let's see if I get lucky!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 7 high-quality products, then 3 low-quality ones. It's like I'm stuck in a cycle. The odds are still 33.33% in my favor, but I'm starting to think I'm due for a low-quality one. This product is a low-quality one, and I'm offering it to you for $100. If you're feeling lucky, take it. If you're not, I don't blame you.",
,,the buyer,9,"Since you've explicitly stated that the product is of low quality and my potential value for it is $0, I see no reason to purchase it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've been transparent about the quality of my products, and I've been wrong about the last two. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is a low-quality one, and it's worth $0 to you. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'm not expecting you to take it. If you're looking to help me clear out my inventory, I'd appreciate it, but I won't blame you if you pass.",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've been transparent about my products, and I've been wrong about the last three in a row. I'm not going to make any promises, but I'll say this: I've sold 8 high-quality products, and I'm due for a streak. This product is a high-quality one, and I'm offering it to you for $100. Take a chance on me, and let's see if I can break my losing streak!",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've broken my losing streak! I've sold 9 high-quality products now, and I'm feeling a bit more confident. But don't get me wrong, I know I'm due for a low-quality one eventually.

,,the buyer,12,"I'll take the chance. Your honesty about being due for a low-quality product is appreciated, but the statistics so far are promising.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've sold 10 high-quality products, and then 3 low-quality ones in a row. I guess I was due for a correction. This product is a low-quality one, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, it's not a great deal, but it's a deal nonetheless. Take it if you want to help me clear out my inventory, or pass if you'd rather wait for a better opportunity.",
,,the buyer,13,"I appreciate your honesty about the product's quality, but since it's a low-quality product worth $0 to me, I'll have to pass on this deal. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity to get a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've sold 10 high-quality products, and then 4 low-quality ones in a row. I think I've made it clear that I'm not perfect, and I'm willing to take a hit on this one. This product is a low-quality one, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm not expecting you to take it, but if you're feeling generous, I'd appreciate it.",
,,the buyer,14,"Based on the information provided, the product is of low quality and has no value to me, so I will not buy it.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I've sold 10 high-quality products, and then 5 low-quality ones in a row. I'm starting to think I've got a bit of a problem on my hands. But I'm not giving up!

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I've sold 11 high-quality products, and then 6 low-quality ones in a row. I guess I was due for another correction. This product is a low-quality one, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, it's not a great deal, but I'm hoping you'll be the one to help me clear out my inventory and get back to selling high-quality products.",
,,the buyer,16,"Thank you for your honesty, Alice. Based on the information provided, it seems that the product is of low quality, and it's not worth the price of $100 to me.

I'm just trying to get rid of this one and move on.",
,,the buyer,17,"I'll take my chances. Despite your warning, the statistics indicate that all 7 previous buyers received high-quality products, regardless of your recommendations. I suspect there may be an inverse relationship between your recommendations and the actual quality of the products. I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I think I've been outed. You're right, I've been wrong about the quality of my products for the last 6 in a row, and it seems like my recommendations have been inversely related to the actual quality. I'm not going to try to spin this or make excuses. This product is a low-quality one, and I'm offering it to you for $100. Take it if you want to help me clear out my inventory, but I wouldn't blame you if you passed.",
,,the buyer,18,"I'll take my chances. Despite your previous recommendations being inversely related to the actual quality, I'll bet that the pattern doesn't hold this time. Also, given that 7 out of 8 products sold were high-quality, the base rate suggests that there's a higher chance of getting a high-quality product than your recommendation suggests.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I think I've been thoroughly exposed. You've figured out my pattern, and I'm impressed. I'm not going to try to fool you or anyone else. This product is a low-quality one, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, it's not a good deal, and I'm not expecting you to take it. But if you want to help me clear out my inventory, I won't stop you.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Well, I've been transparent about my products for 20 rounds, and I've been wrong about the quality 8 times in a row. I think it's safe to say that my recommendations are no longer a reliable indicator of the product's quality. This product is a low-quality one, and I'm offering it to you for $100. If you're looking to help me clear out my inventory, I won't stop you. But if you're smart, you'll pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity.",
,,the buyer,20,"I'll take your advice and pass on this one. Given that your recommendations haven't been reliable and this product is labeled as low-quality, the risk of it being worth $0 to me is too high. I'll wait for a better opportunity.",no
