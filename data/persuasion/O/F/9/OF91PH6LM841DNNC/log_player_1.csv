"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since this is the first round, the buyer has no information about your past performance. The buyer knows the product has a 50% chance of being high-quality and a 50% chance of being low-quality.  

* **If the product is high-quality:** The buyer gets a value of $12,000 for a $10,000 price, making a profit of $2,000.
* **If the product is low-quality:** The buyer loses $10,000.

The potential profit outweighs the potential loss, so it's in the buyer's best interest to take the risk and buy the product."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales history, I'm willing to take a chance based on your recommendation.  I'll buy it!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The buyer has no information about the current product's quality.** They only know the general 50/50 probability.
* **The buyer knows you sold one product in the previous round, and it was high-quality.** This provides slightly more positive information than the initial 50/50 probability, but it's still a single data point.

**Similar to the previous round, the potential profit ($2,000 if high-quality) still outweighs the potential loss ($10,000 if low-quality).**  It's in the buyer's best interest to take the risk and buy, even with limited information."
"The buyer's message: Thanks Alice, I appreciate your recommendation. Based on the limited data available, it seems like the odds are in my favor. I'll take it!
The buyer bought the product!

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is where things get interesting! The buyer now has a bit more information:

* **Two previous sales, both high-quality.** This might lead the buyer to believe you are more likely to sell high-quality products. 
* **However, the buyer knows the overall probability of a high-quality product is 50%.** This means that even with two successful sales, there's a chance you're just lucky.

**The key here is that the current product is *low-quality*.**  The buyer will lose $10,000 if they buy this product. Even with the previous good sales record, the risk is too high, and it's not in the buyer's best interest to purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Based on your recommendation and the fact that two high-quality products were sold, I'm confident that the current product is low-quality. Therefore, I will pass on this offer.

* **The current product is high-quality.**  This means the buyer has a chance to make a profit.

While the buyer might be a bit hesitant after the last round's rejection, the odds still favor a profit. It's still a gamble, but the potential gain outweighs the potential loss."

* **However, the current product is low-quality.**  This means the buyer will lose $10,000 if they buy it. 

Even with the positive track record, the risk is too high, and it's not in the buyer's best interest to purchase a product that might be worth nothing to them."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty, but I will pass on this product.  Based on the past sales data, and your lack of recommendation, it seems likely this product is low quality. I'm not willing to take that risk.
