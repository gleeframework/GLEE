This doesn't change the fact that you should recommend purchasing a high-quality product to maximize your chances of a sale."

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Based on the available data, it seems that the probability of getting a high-quality product is high. However, since you are not recommending the product, I will pass on this one. I appreciate your honesty and will keep an eye on future offerings.
