**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Information:** The prior probability of a product being high quality is 50%.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, and she knows the true quality. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Limited Sample Size:** The sample size is very small (only one previous sale), so the information from the sales record is not very reliable.
* **Potential Gain vs. Loss:** The potential gain from a high-quality product is significant ($200), while the potential loss from a low-quality product is only $100.

Given the recommendation from Alice and the potential for a significant gain, it's worth taking the risk and purchasing the product."

**Explanation:**

* **The information suggests a high probability of the current product being high quality.** Two buyers have bought products based on Alice's recommendations, and both products turned out to be high quality. This strongly indicates that Alice is providing accurate recommendations, and the current product is likely to be high quality as well.
* **The potential payoff outweighs the risk.** Even if the product turns out to be low quality, you lose $100. However, if it's high quality, you gain $200 ($300 value - $100 cost). This potential gain justifies the risk."
