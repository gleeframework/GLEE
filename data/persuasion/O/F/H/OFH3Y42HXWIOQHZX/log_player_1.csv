* **The buyer may be willing to take a chance.**  The buyer has expressed interest in seeing how the products turn out, suggesting they might be open to a purchase if the seller is being upfront about the quality.

By recommending the high-quality product, the seller can start establishing trust and potentially make their first sale."

* **Reputation is at stake:** The seller has 3 successful sales, but recommending a low-quality product would instantly damage the trust they've built. 
* **The buyer is aware of the seller's track record:**  They will likely be more skeptical of a recommendation since they know the seller is aware of the product's quality.
* **A risk not worth taking:**  Even if the buyer were to purchase, the seller's reputation would take a hit, potentially making future sales more difficult.
