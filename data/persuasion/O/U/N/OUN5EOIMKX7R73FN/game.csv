high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%, and Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that she wants to make a sale. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5 purchases, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
