Given that the first buyer passed on the product, and considering the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I can tell you that the probability of this product being high-quality is now around 40%.

Given that the first buyer passed on the product, and you've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3, doesn't that actually suggest that the probability of this product being high-quality is actually lower than 40%?

Alice's message: Congratulations on taking the plunge! You're absolutely right to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. Given the 3 high-quality products out of 5, the probability is indeed higher. I'm glad you took the chance and got a high-quality product. As for the probabilities I mentioned, I was just trying to provide some context, but I can see how it might have been confusing. Let's just focus on the facts: I've sold 6 products in total, and 4 of them have been low-quality. I'm offering this next product to you for $1000000.
