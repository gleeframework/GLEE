,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer based on the current data. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 product sold, the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer is 50%. However, I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer based on the current data and my decision to pass on this product."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to decline the product based on Alice's recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that this product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me the proportion of low-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold?"

,,Alice,12,no,

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate a higher chance of the current product being low-quality, but I also don't want to give up the opportunity to buy a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and have not found a high-quality product. This suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. Given Alice's recommendation not to buy, I'm inclined to believe that this product is also low-quality. I will pass on it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth only $0 to me."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000. I'd like to see more information about the products before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm concerned that if there are 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products have been sold, it's possible that the products are all low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
