Alice's message: You've just seen that the previous three products were low-quality, and you're considering buying this one. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far. I want to give you a heads up: if I were selling high-quality products at a 33.33% rate, I'd expect to have sold at least 1 high-quality product by now.
