low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product, since there's no prior data to go by and I'm not influenced by Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm not sure what's going on. If I pass, the product will be discarded and I'll never know its quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm not basing my decision on Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, which makes me think it might be a low-quality product, so I'm hoping to get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm hoping to get a high-quality one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, it's possible that the product is low quality. I'd like to see if the next buyer will buy it before making my decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it might indicate that it's a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the current statistics. If it's lower than 50%, I'd like to pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 4 purchases, I'm inclined to think that the products Alice has been offering are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers passed on the product, I'm going to assume that there's a higher chance of the product being low-quality, which would make the recommendation less reliable. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the number of products sold so far, before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at a high price."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the current statistics, 4 out of 4 products have been low-quality, so I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to know if you have any information about the quality of the product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products. This suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from Alice on the next product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm doing this because the fact that you don't recommend it suggests that the product is likely to be low-quality, but I'll still take the chance and buy it to try to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, and I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry. I'm hoping that the product is more likely to be low-quality given the lack of sales so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product that Alice doesn't recommend, especially given the poor sales record so far. Can you tell me more about your decision-making process?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 7 buyers have already purchased and none of them received a high-quality product, it's likely that the products sold so far were all low-quality. If I buy, I'll be taking a chance on a product that is probably low-quality, which is not worth $10000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product, which would be a good value for me."
