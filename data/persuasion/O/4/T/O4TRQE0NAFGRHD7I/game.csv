high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, and Alice recommends buying every time, I'm suspicious that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to increase the chances of selling them."
