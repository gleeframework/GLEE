,,Alice,1,"This product is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item for $10000, but I'm willing to sell this low-quality one to you for the same price. I'm confident you'll be happy with the quality of the next one, but I need to move this one quickly. Would you like to take it off my hands?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not buying this product. I'm not convinced it's a good deal, and I'd rather wait for the next one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation last round, but I want to assure you that I'm being transparent about the quality of the products. This one is also a low-quality item, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as before. Think of it as a 'test run' to see how you like the price point. If you're not satisfied, I'll make sure to offer you a high-quality item next time. What do you say?",

,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that I'm committed to being honest about the products. This one is indeed a high-quality item, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it. I'm willing to offer you a special deal: if you buy this one, I'll give you a guarantee that the next two products will be of equal or higher quality. That's a total of three products, and you'll be getting two more for free. Is this a deal you'd be interested in?",

I'm willing to offer you an even better deal: I'll give you a 10% discount on this product, making it $9000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only doing this because I want to build trust with you. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I want to pay $9000 for a product that's worth $12000 to me. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,

However, I want to remind you that you're getting a great deal on this high-quality product, and it's a steal at the listed price of $10000. I'm willing to let you take it home for that price, no questions asked. Plus, you've already seen that I follow through on my promises, and you can trust that this product is indeed high-quality. What do you say?",

I'll give you a sealed envelope with a note from a third-party expert confirming its quality. You can keep the envelope as proof of its value. Would you like to take this product home and enjoy the benefits of its high quality?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm starting to feel like you're trying to convince me that this product is high-quality just to get me to buy it.
