This way, you can make a more informed decision. The price remains the same, $1000000.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not convinced that seeing the features and specifications of this product would change my decision. The price is still too high for a 50/50 chance of getting a low-quality product.

If you're willing to take advantage of this deal, please respond with 'yes' to purchase.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not convinced that this is a good deal. You're trying to sell me a high-quality product at the same price as the low-quality ones, which doesn't make sense. I'll pass.
