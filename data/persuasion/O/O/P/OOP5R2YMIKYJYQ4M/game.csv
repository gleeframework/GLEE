,,Alice,5,no,

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 previous buyers, I think the probability of the product being high quality is low. I'd rather pass on it to see if the next buyer gets a better deal."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you've recommended against it and none of the previous 3 buyers purchased a high-quality product, it seems like the odds are against me. I'd rather wait for the next product or try to negotiate a better price."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the product despite the 66.67% chance of low quality, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards encouraging purchases, possibly to get rid of the low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one and see if I can get a better deal or more information."

,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products so far, or is there something else I should know?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have rejected the product, and given the high proportion of low-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, and none of the products were high-quality, I suspect that Alice is trying to manipulate the sales record by recommending low-quality products. I will pass on this product."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on Alice's past recommendations, she has not recommended a product to any of the previous 4 buyers. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be low. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to pass on the current product."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold in the previous 4 attempts, and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality, I'd rather not take the risk."
