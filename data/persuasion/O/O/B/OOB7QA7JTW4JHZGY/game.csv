low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,I'd like to buy the product and set the precedent for future buyers.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the current statistics, it seems unlikely that the product is high-quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that it's high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if the product is high quality, which would be a great opportunity for me. If it's low quality, I won't be losing much, but I'll also get to see the updated statistics."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than the expected 80%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on my own analysis, not Alice's recommendation. I want to see if I can beat her track record of 0 high-quality sales."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is not to buy, which makes me think the product might be low quality. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, so she may be trying to get me to buy a low-quality product. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 6 buyers have purchased and none of them received a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it's likely that the remaining products are of low quality. I will pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you don't recommend it and all previous buyers also passed on the products, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Is there a pattern or anomaly in the previous sales that I should be aware of?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation. Can you share that with me?
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 80% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 out of 7 products were low quality, I'm going to take a chance that the product is low quality and discard it to avoid the $1000000 cost."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous 7 products sold were high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous 7 buyers received low-quality products, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the products being sold might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
