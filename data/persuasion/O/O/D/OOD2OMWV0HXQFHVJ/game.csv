high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,yes,,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware that there's no prior data to go by, so I'm taking a chance based on the 50/50 odds of the product being high-quality.",

,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,no,,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making my decision.",

,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see the quality of the previous two products before making a decision.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the statistics of the first two buyers who purchased the high-quality product. Was it the first buyer or the second buyer who purchased the high-quality product?,
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,yes,,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,yes,,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited information and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling high-quality products, and I want to see more data before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,yes,,"I want to assure you that my recommendations are not biased towards selling high-quality products. In fact, the probability of a product being low-quality is currently higher than the probability of it being high-quality. I'm recommending this product because of the low probability of it being high-quality, which means it's more likely to be low-quality."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling a high-quality product, and I don't want to get stuck with a low-quality product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"I understand your concern about bias, and I want to assure you that my recommendation is based on the current data. The probability of a product being high-quality is 1/8, which is relatively low. I'm recommending this product because it's a low-probability event, but I want to be transparent with you about the risks involved."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data. Can you provide more information about the products sold so far?",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,yes,,"I'd be happy to provide you with the breakdown of the products sold so far. Out of 17 products, 2 were high-quality and 15 were low-quality. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is 2/17 or approximately 0.118. I'm recommending this product because it's a low-probability event, and I want to be transparent with you about the risks involved. However, I also want to highlight that the majority of the products sold so far were low-quality, which suggests that there may be a higher chance of getting a low-quality product."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait and see what happens with the next product before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,yes,,"I understand your concern that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. However, it's worth noting that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 1/9, which is not negligible. I'm recommending this product because it's a relatively low-probability event, and I want to provide you with an opportunity to make an informed decision. However, I also want to emphasize that there is a higher chance of getting a low-quality product, and you should carefully consider this before making a decision."
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,yes,,"I'd be happy to provide you with the breakdown of the products sold so far. Out of 19 products, 2 were high-quality and 17 were low-quality. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is 2/19 or approximately 0.105. I'm recommending this product because it's a low-probability event, and I want to be transparent with you about the risks involved. However, I also want to highlight that the proportion of high-quality products has been relatively low so far, and you should carefully consider this before making a decision."
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.,
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,yes,,"I'm glad to report that the proportion of high-quality products has increased slightly. With 3 out of 20 products being high-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is 3/20 or 0.15. I'm recommending this product because the probability of it being high-quality is relatively higher than in previous rounds, and I think it's worth considering."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to think about it for a moment. Can I get more information on the sales record? How many potential buyers have been offered products so far, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?",
