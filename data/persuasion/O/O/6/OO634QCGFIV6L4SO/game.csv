,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you have any other products to offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, even without a recommendation from you. I'm willing to take the chance of getting a low-quality product for $10000, which is a significant loss, but I might get a high-quality product worth $30000, which would be a great gain."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that you recommended it, which might indicate it's low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer's experience with the product?

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products have been low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the high probability of low-quality products, I'm inclined to be cautious and pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't find a high-quality product. This makes me suspect that the remaining products might be of low quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice has recommended two previous products and neither of them were high quality, indicating a potential bias in her recommendations."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, and Alice recommended me to buy, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products you're offering. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a risk-taker and I'm willing to take the chance on a potential $30000 product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the 33.33% chance, especially since Alice has already recommended it to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous 3 products were high-quality. I'd like to see a more balanced sales record before making a purchase."

,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the low sales record and no high-quality products sold yet, I'm willing to take the risk and hope for a high-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 4 buyers have been presented with the product and none of them found a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the initial 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me if I were to buy it. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer based on the current statistics?"
