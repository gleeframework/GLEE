Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a premium item. If you're interested, I can provide more details about the product's features and benefits. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next round.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take it, but only because I think it's a high-quality product. If it's low quality, I'll be disappointed, but I'm willing to take the risk.""

If you buy this one, I'll give you a 5% discount, making the price $950000. This is a one-time offer, and it's only available to you because of your previous purchase. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not going to fall for the discount. I already took a risk on the first product, and I'm not sure if this one is high-quality. I'd rather wait and see if you have any other products to offer.""

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation, but I'd like to provide you with a different perspective.

I'll give you a new offer: I'll let you buy this high-quality product for $900000, a $100000 discount. This is a one-time offer, and it's only available to you because of your previous interactions with me. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not convinced that it's a good idea to buy a product without knowing its quality first. The guarantee doesn't change the fact that there's still a 20% chance of buying a low-quality product, and I'd rather not take that risk.""
