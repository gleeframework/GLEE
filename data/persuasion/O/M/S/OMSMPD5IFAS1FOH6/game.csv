I'm willing to let it go for the same price as the previous high-quality products: $1000000. Would you like to take it home?",

,,Alice,8,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 7 attempts, which means I've had two 'off' products in a row. I want to be upfront with you - my track record is starting to look a bit more like the expected 33.33% chance of a high-quality product. That being said, I still believe this product has value, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's even more competitive than before. I'll give you a 20% discount, bringing the price down to $800000. Would you like to take a chance on this product?",

But I'm a businessperson, and I need to make a living. So, I'll be upfront with you - this product is definitely low-quality. I'll give it to you for the lowest price I've ever offered: $600000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. Would you like to take a chance on this product and help me get back on track?",

,,Alice,11,"I think it's time for me to swallow my pride and admit that my sales strategy isn't working out as planned. I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 10 attempts, which is nowhere near the 33.33% chance I claimed. I'm starting to think that I've been overestimating the value of my products. With that in mind, I'm willing to give you an even better deal: I'll sell this product to you for $500000, and I'll throw in a full refund if it's not what you're looking for.
