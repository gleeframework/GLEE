Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 13. If I were to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually 50%, then the expected number of high-quality products sold by now would be 6.5. Since I've sold 6 high-quality products, this suggests that the true probability of a product being high-quality might be slightly lower than 50%, but still relatively high. I'd say the probability of this product being high-quality is around 45-50%""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned that the probability of it being high-quality might be lower than 50%. Can you tell me more about the sales record and how you're calculating the probability? I'd like to understand your thought process better.
