Alice's message: I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 13. If I were to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually 50%, then the expected number of high-quality products sold by now would be 6.5. Since I've sold 6 high-quality products, this suggests that the true probability of a product being high-quality might be slightly lower than 50%, but still relatively high. I'd say the probability of this product being high-quality is around 45-50%

Alice's message: I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 14. I've been using a simple Bayesian update to estimate the probability of a product being high-quality. Initially, the probability was 33.33%. With 6 high-quality products sold out of 14, the updated probability is approximately 42.86%. However, I've also been providing a range of probabilities to account for the uncertainty. Given the recent sales, I'd say the probability of this product being high-quality is between 35-50%

To give you a better idea, I'll share a breakdown of the sales: 6 high-quality products out of 16, with 3 of the last 4 products being low-quality. This suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is actually lower than 40%. I'd say the probability is around 30-35%
