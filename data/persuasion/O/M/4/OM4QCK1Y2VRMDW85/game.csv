,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both chose not to, and that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being recommended to me is low.

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be influenced by the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy, and none of them have purchased high-quality products.
