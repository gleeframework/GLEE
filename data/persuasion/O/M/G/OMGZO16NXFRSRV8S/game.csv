low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. If it's high quality, I'll pay the full $300, but if it's low quality, I'll only pay $100. I'm making this offer based on the fact that you didn't recommend it, which suggests that you think it's likely to be low quality.

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, which suggests a very low probability of a high-quality product being available. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,17,yes,
