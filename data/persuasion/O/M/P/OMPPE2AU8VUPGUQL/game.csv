,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of the first 4 products were recommended and none were high-quality, it seems like Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I'll wait for the next product."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
