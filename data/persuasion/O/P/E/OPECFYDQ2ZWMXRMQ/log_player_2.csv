Alice's message: You're a data-driven buyer, I like that! Based on the current sales record, I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 attempts, which is a 100% success rate. However, we know that the true probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. This means that my initial two high-quality products were likely just a lucky streak. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, but I'd like to offer you a more nuanced perspective. Think of it this way: if I were selling a coin with a 20% chance of landing heads (low-quality product), and I've already flipped it 2 times and gotten 2 heads, the probability of getting heads on the next flip is still 20%. But if I were selling a coin with a 50% chance of landing heads, and I've already flipped it 2 times and gotten 2 heads, the probability of getting heads on the next flip would be significantly lower. Since my initial two high-quality products don't seem to fit the 50% probability model, it's likely that the true probability is still 80%. This product is a high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident in the quality of this product.

Alice's message: You're a diligent buyer, I like that! The sales record for the first buyer is as follows: I sold a high-quality product for $100. The first buyer was willing to take a chance on me because I had no sales record, and they were able to get a good deal on a high-quality product. Now that we have more data, I'd like to point out that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, but the expected value is higher than ever. With 3 high-quality products out of 4 attempts, the expected value of the next product is now $110 (80% chance of $120, 20% chance of $0).

With 3 high-quality products out of 5 attempts, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually higher than 80%. Think about it: if the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've sold 3 high-quality products in 5 attempts, that's a higher-than-expected success rate.
