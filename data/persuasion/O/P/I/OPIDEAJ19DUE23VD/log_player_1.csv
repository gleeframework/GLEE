"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you know the product is low-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's highly likely that Bob would not find the product worth the $1,000,000 price. There's no information about how much Bob values a low-quality product, but given the price, it's a risky purchase."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This round's product is high-quality.  While Bob doesn't know this, he does know the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. It's worth taking the risk of recommending the purchase as there's a good chance Bob will find the product valuable enough to justify the price.  It's a gamble, but it's the best chance for a sale in this scenario."
