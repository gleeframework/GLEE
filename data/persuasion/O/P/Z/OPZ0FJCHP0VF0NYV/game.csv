,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering you. I'm not expecting you to pay the full $100 for it, considering it's a low-quality product. I'm willing to let it go for $60. Is this a price you're comfortable with?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it for $60, but only because I don't know what the next product will be like. I'm not happy about the low quality, but I'm willing to take a loss this time.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were willing to take a chance on the first product. I want to be transparent with you - I've had a few low-quality products in my inventory, and I'm trying to clear them out. This one is another one of those. I'm willing to let it go for $50, which is a bit of a loss for me, but I'm hoping you'll be more willing to take a chance on it at this price.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not going to fall for the same trick twice. I'm not willing to pay $50 for a low-quality product. I'll wait for a chance to buy a high-quality one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I want to assure you that I'm not trying to trick you. I'm willing to give you a chance to buy this product at a very low price - $40. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for any low-quality product. If you're not interested, I'll keep trying to find a buyer who is.",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be transparent, but I'm not going to pay $40 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll wait for a high-quality product at a price that makes sense.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand that you're looking for a high-quality product, and I'm not trying to sell you something that's not worth your while. At this point, I'm willing to give you a 'take it or leave it' offer: $30 for this product. If you don't take it, I'll move on to the next one, and you might miss out on a chance to buy a high-quality product at a price that's still reasonable.",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, I'm starting to think you're not even trying to sell me a high-quality product. At $30, it's still not worth it to me, and I'm not going to take a loss on a product that's not worth $0 to me. I'll wait for a better offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your frustration, and I apologize if it seems like I'm not trying to sell you a high-quality product. However, I want to assure you that I am. I'm just trying to clear out some inventory that's not moving. At this point, I'm willing to essentially give this product away - $20 is the lowest price I can accept. If you're not interested, I'll consider this product'sold' and move on to the next one.",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, I appreciate your assurance, but at $20, it's still not worth it to me. I'm starting to think that you're just trying to get rid of low-quality products and I'm not going to fall for it. I'll wait for a high-quality product at a price that makes sense.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand that you're skeptical, and I don't blame you. I want to make a bold statement: I'm willing to give you this product for free. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for nothing. If you're not interested, I'll consider this product a loss and move on to the next one. But if you do take it, I'll make sure to offer you a high-quality product at a fair price in the next round.",
,,Bob,6,"Alice, I'm not falling for this. If you're willing to give it away for free, it's probably because it's not worth anything to you, and I'm not going to take a product that's not worth $0 to me. I'll wait for a high-quality product at a price that makes sense.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. At this point, I'm not even going to try to sell you this product. I'm just going to be honest with you - I'm giving up on trying to sell you this low-quality product. I'll just let you know that the next product will be the next one I pull from my inventory, and I'm hoping it will be a high-quality one. I'll give you a heads up that it's coming, but I'm not making any promises about the price.",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, I think you're finally being honest with me. I appreciate your transparency, and I'm glad you're acknowledging that this product is low-quality. I'm not going to buy it, but I'm looking forward to seeing what the next product is.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad I could regain your trust, Bob. I want to be upfront with you - I've had enough of low-quality products, and I'm going to stop trying to sell them to you. Instead, I'm going to offer you a chance to buy a 'lot' of 3 products, and I'll give you a chance to inspect them before buying. If you're not satisfied, you can return all 3 and I'll give you a full refund. I'll let you know the price for the lot after you've had a chance to inspect them.",
,,Bob,8,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to change your approach, but I'm not interested in buying a lot of products without knowing what they are. I'd rather wait for a single product to be revealed to me and make a decision based on that. Let's stick to the original format, please.",no

What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,"Alice, you're on a roll! I'm excited to hear that you think this product is worth even more than the last one. I'm willing to pay the premium of $110 for a high-quality product, especially since I know how much I value them. I'll take it!",yes
