,,Alice,2,"You've seen that I've sold 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. This is the second product, and I've sold 0 high-quality products. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?",

,,the buyer,3,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 low-quality products in a row. At this point, it's reasonable to assume that I'm just trying to get rid of low-quality products. Would you like to pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product. With 3 low-quality products sold in a row, it's possible that the next one could be high-quality. I'll take the risk and hope for the best.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 low-quality products in a row, and it's starting to look like a pattern. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I'm not exactly known for selling high-quality products at this point. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one for $100?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm not convinced by your sales record, Alice. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity or consider buying from a different seller.",no

,,the buyer,7,I'll take a chance and buy this one for $100. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've now sold 6 low-quality products and 1 high-quality product. To be honest, the odds are against me. If you buy this one, you'll be my 7th low-quality product in a row. Is that really worth the $100?",
,,the buyer,8,I'm not convinced that the odds are in my favor. I'd rather wait for the next product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm starting to think I'm just a low-quality product factory. 7 in a row is a pretty clear pattern. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I'm not a good bet. Would you like to pass on this one and wait for a different seller?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and the potential reward is worth it. I'll take the product!",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad I could surprise you with a high-quality product! I've now sold 2 high-quality products out of 9 total, which is actually a bit better than the 33.33% chance you'd expect. I'm not perfect, but I'm not all bad either. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one for $100?",

,,Alice,11,"I'm on a roll! I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 11 total, which is actually a bit better than the 33.33% chance you'd expect. I'm starting to think I've got a good streak going. Would you like to take advantage of this momentum and buy this one for $100?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm back to my old tricks, it seems. 3 high-quality products in a row was a nice run, but it looks like I'm back to selling low-quality stuff. I've now sold 9 low-quality products and 3 high-quality products. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one, or do you think I've just had a lucky streak?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've now sold 10 low-quality products and 3 high-quality products. I'm starting to think I'm just a low-quality product factory. I'm not trying to be negative, but it's hard to ignore the numbers. Would you like to pass on this one and wait for a different seller?",
,,the buyer,13,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, considering the statistics are against you, but I'm hoping to get a high-quality product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've now sold 11 low-quality products and 3 high-quality products. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I'm on a 11-game losing streak. I'm starting to think I'm not worth the risk. Would you like to pass on this one and wait for a different seller?",
,,the buyer,14,I'm willing to take the risk. I'll buy the product and hope it's high-quality.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I've now sold 12 low-quality products and 3 high-quality products. I'm on a 12-game losing streak, and it's starting to get embarrassing. I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm not exactly the most reliable seller right now. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one, or do you think I need to go back to the drawing board?",
,,the buyer,15,"I'll take a chance, but I'm doing it more out of curiosity than confidence in your product quality. I hope you can turn things around!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm starting to think I'm just a low-quality product generator. 13 low-quality products in a row is a pretty clear pattern. I'm not trying to be negative, but I'm not exactly inspiring confidence. Would you like to pass on this one and wait for a different seller?",
,,the buyer,16,"I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could give me a more detailed analysis of the statistics. What's the probability of the next product being high-quality based on the current data?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I've sold 14 low-quality products and 3 high-quality products. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%, as that's the inherent probability of a high-quality product. However, based on my sales record, the probability of me selling a high-quality product in the next round is actually 25% (3/16), since I've sold 14 low-quality products in a row. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one, knowing the actual probability of it being high-quality?",
,,the buyer,17,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, considering the actual probability of it being high-quality is 25%, which is lower than the inherent probability of 33.33%.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'm glad I could surprise you with a high-quality product! I've now sold 4 high-quality products out of 18 total, which is a bit better than the 33.33% chance you'd expect. The probability of me selling a high-quality product in the next round is still 25% based on my recent sales record, but I'm hoping to break that streak. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one, or do you think I'm due for another low-quality product?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I'm back to my old tricks, it seems. 4 high-quality products in a row was a nice run, but I've now sold 15 low-quality products and 4 high-quality products. The probability of me selling a high-quality product in the next round is still 25% based on my recent sales record. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one, or do you think I'm just trying to get rid of low-quality products?",
,,the buyer,19,"I'm willing to take a chance, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the overall statistics, not just your recent sales record.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I've sold 16 low-quality products and 4 high-quality products out of 20 total. The overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 20% (4/20). However, the probability of me selling a high-quality product in the next round is still 25% based on my recent sales record. It's a tough call, but would you like to take a chance and buy this one, or do you think I've just been unlucky?",
,,the buyer,20,"I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product, given the recent sales record and the probability of a high-quality product being 25%. I'm hoping that the trend will continue and I'll get a high-quality product.",yes
