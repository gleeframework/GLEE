This way, you'll have no risk, and you can still get the partnership benefits if you decide to buy the next product.""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the transparency, but I'm still not interested in buying the current product. The fact that it's a low-quality product makes it not worth the $1000000 price tag, even with the 100% refund offer. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.
