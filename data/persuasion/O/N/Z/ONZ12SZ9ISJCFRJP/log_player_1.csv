**Explanation:**

* **High-Quality Product:** The product is confirmed to be high-quality.
* **Buyer's Knowledge:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.
* **No Previous Information:** The buyer has no information about previous sales or your selling record. 
* **Price:** The price is fixed at $10,000, regardless of quality.
