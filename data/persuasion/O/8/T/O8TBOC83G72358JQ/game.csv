high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and ended up passing, it suggests that the product might be low quality.

,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 buyers have received low-quality products from Alice, which suggests a high likelihood of this product being low quality as well. I'd rather not take the risk of losing $1000000 on a low-quality product."
