**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are highly reliable.
* **Limited Risk:**  While the product has a 2/3 chance of being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($200) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).
* **Trust in Alice:** Since Alice is recommending the product, it increases the probability of it being high quality. 

**It's important to note:** This is a calculated risk. There's still a chance the product is low quality. However, based on the information available, the decision to buy is the most logical one."
