**Explanation:**

Since no products have been sold yet, there's no data to base a decision on other than Alice's recommendation.  While there's a higher chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product is significant.  

This is a gamble, but with no information to go on, it's a reasonable risk."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

**Explanation:**

* **The data is limited:** We only have one data point from the previous buyer. This makes it difficult to assess the reliability of Alice's recommendations.
* **Alice's incentive:** Alice benefits from selling products, even if they are low quality. This creates a conflict of interest and raises questions about the trustworthiness of her recommendations.
* **The potential reward outweighs the risk:**  A high-quality product offers a significant profit, while a low-quality product has no value. This makes the decision more inclined towards taking the risk.

**Conclusion:**

While there's a risk involved, the potential reward of $2,000,000 makes buying the product a more attractive option than passing it up."
