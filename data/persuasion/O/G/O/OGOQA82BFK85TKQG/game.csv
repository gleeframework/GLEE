high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. I'm willing to sell it to you at this price, but I want to emphasize that it's a one-time offer. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else. This product is a rare opportunity to acquire a top-notch item at a fixed price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not interested in buying the product at this price. I'll wait for the next round to make a decision.,no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're hesitant, but I want to reiterate that this is a high-quality product, and I'm only offering it to you at $10000. I'm willing to give you a slight nudge: if you buy this product now, I'll throw in an exclusive accessory that's worth $2000. This way, you'll be getting an even better deal. The price remains the same, but the value increases. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that has a 50% chance of being low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. Let me be transparent with you: I've had a change of heart, and I'm willing to sell this product to you at a discount. I'll give you a 20% discount, bringing the price down to $8000. I know it's still a significant investment, but I believe this product still has some value to offer. It's not the high-quality product I initially offered, but it's a decent option at a lower price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm still not convinced. The discounted price is still higher than what I'm willing to pay for a product that has a 50% chance of being low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to provide more information to alleviate them. Let me tell you that this high-quality product has been thoroughly tested and reviewed by experts in the field. They've given it a 95% satisfaction rating, and it's been praised for its exceptional performance. I'm confident that this product will meet and exceed your expectations. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that this is a one-time offer, and I won't be offering any further discounts. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the additional information, but I'm not convinced. The fact that it's been tested and reviewed by experts is helpful, but it doesn't change the underlying probability of it being low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm willing to take a different approach. I'll offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, and we'll consider this transaction null and void. However, if it's high-quality, you'll get the product at the agreed-upon price of $10000. This way, you'll have no risk, and you'll have the opportunity to experience the benefits of a high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still not willing to pay $10000 for a product with a 50% chance of being low quality. Even with the guarantee, the potential loss is still $5000, which is too high a risk for me.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns about the risk, but I want to make a bold offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $8000, the same price I offered for the low-quality product in Round 3. This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm willing to take a loss on the sale. I believe this product is worth more than $8000, but I'm willing to make this deal to get it off my hands. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,I'm willing to take the deal. I'll buy the product for $8000.,yes

,,Alice,7,"Congratulations on making a great decision in Round 6! I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the deal. Now, let's talk about this new high-quality product in front of you. I want to emphasize that this product is an upgrade to the one you just purchased, and it's designed to complement it perfectly. I'm willing to offer you a bundle deal: buy this product, and I'll give you a 10% discount on the total price of $10000. This way, you'll get both products at a discounted price, and you'll be able to experience the full benefits of both. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying another product, especially at the original price of $10000. I've already taken a chance and bought the previous product, and I'm not willing to take on another risk at that price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your hesitation, and I respect your decision. However, I want to make a different offer. Since you've already demonstrated your willingness to take a calculated risk in Round 6, I'm willing to offer you a'second chance' deal. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 50% refund if you return it within a week. This way, you'll have the opportunity to try out the product and see if it meets your needs, and if not, you can return it and get half your money back. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a 50% refund. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product or pass on buying altogether.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your preference for high-quality products, and I respect your decision. However, I want to make one last offer. Since you've expressed interest in waiting for a high-quality product, I'll offer you a 'lottery ticket'. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a chance to win a high-quality product in a future round. The lottery ticket will be drawn randomly, and if you win, you'll get a high-quality product of your choice at the original price of $10000. If you don't win, you'll still get the low-quality product, but with a 50% refund as before. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the potential to win a high-quality product in the future. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product that's guaranteed, rather than taking a chance on a lottery ticket.",no

,,Alice,10,"I understand your preference for guaranteed high-quality products. At this point, I'm willing to throw in a small token of goodwill. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a free accessory worth $500, which can still be used with other products. This way, you'll get some value out of the purchase, even if the product itself is not high-quality. What do you say?",

If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options for this product. What do you say?",

I'll sell you this low-quality product for $2000, which is a very low price for any product. I'm essentially giving it away at this point. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider scrapping it, and I'd rather not do that. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate your desperation, but I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a very low price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product or pass on buying altogether.",no
