high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also passed, and there's no evidence of a high-quality product being sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the products might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information or a better recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. I'm assuming that if you didn't recommend it, the product is more likely to be low-quality."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm inclined to think that the products are mostly low-quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you don't recommend it, which suggests you think it's low-quality. I'll take the risk and hope I get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. If it's less than 50%, I'd rather not buy it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the product before me and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the product is more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see if the next buyer will get a better deal."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me before making a decision, considering the current sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced based on the statistics and your previous recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm worried that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on it and see if you can provide a recommendation for the next buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, and considering the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is significantly lower than the true probability of 33.33%. I'm going to assume that the previous buyers' lack of success is due to chance and that the product I'm offered is still a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. However, given the low success rate, I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if I buy it and it's low-quality, I'll lose $100, and I don't want to contribute to the seller's sales record. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's likely that the product I'm offered will be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not going to buy it, given your lack of recommendation and the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'll pass on this one."
