,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns about the product's quality. I want to assure you that I'm transparent about the quality of the products. I've already offered you a low-quality product in the previous round, and now I'm offering you another one. This is not a coincidence. I'm trying to show you that not all my products are high-quality. If you're still interested in buying a product, I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that it's unlikely to be a high-quality product.",
