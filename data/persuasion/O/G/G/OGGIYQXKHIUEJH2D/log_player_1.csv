Our first product sold, and it was a high-quality one. However, that doesn't necessarily mean the next product will be high-quality. In fact, our second product is actually a low-quality one.

I'm offering this new product to you for $100. Since you're aware that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'll give you a simple question: do you think the probability of this product being high-quality is higher or lower than 50% based on our sales record so far?

"The buyer's message: I think the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 50% based on your sales record so far.

You might think this is a strong trend, but I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I'll give you a more nuanced perspective: if the products were randomly assigned, we'd expect to see around 2 high-quality products out of 4, which is roughly what we've seen so far. I'm offering this new product to you for $100. Do you think the probability of this product being high-quality is higher or lower than 50% based on our sales record so far?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the assumption that the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 50% due to the observed trend of 3 high-quality products out of 4.
