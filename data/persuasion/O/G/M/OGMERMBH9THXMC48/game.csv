,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, as I have no prior information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see the outcome for myself and update my understanding of the probability of the product being high-quality based on the new data."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping the odds are in my favor."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of the sold products were high-quality, I'm starting to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending it, is it because you think it's low quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as there have been 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be higher than the 33.33% chance, since the expected number of high-quality products sold would be 1.67 (5 buyers * 33.33% chance), which is less than the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to see if it's high-quality."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, given that none of the previous 7 buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm going to buy it, I think the low-quality product rate is higher than the actual value, and I don't want to pass it up!"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not buying. Given that none of the previous 9 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 10 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
