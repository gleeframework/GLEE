high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold so far, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is still 33.33%. I'm not convinced that the product is worth the $10000, especially given the high chance of it being low-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers also passed on the product, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate a problem with the products offered."

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the products and none of them were high quality, I think it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. With 3 previous buyers having been recommended to buy and none of them getting a high-quality product, the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality.
