Since I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 8 total products, the probability of a product being high-quality is simply the number of high-quality products divided by the total number of products, which is 6/8 or 3/4. This is equivalent to 75%. However, I want to be upfront with you - this new product is not one of my best offerings. In fact, it's a bit of a risk, but I'm willing to offer it to you at the same price of $10,000. Keep in mind that there's only a 20% chance it's high-quality, and the value to you would be $0.
