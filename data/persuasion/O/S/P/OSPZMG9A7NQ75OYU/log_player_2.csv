Alice's message: You're welcome, Bob! I'm glad you were able to secure a great deal on the previous product. This next product is also of the highest quality, and I'm confident you'll love it. However, I want to be transparent with you - the price remains the same as the previous product, $1000000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the same price for this next product.
