,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous products were low-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous sales record, it seems that all products sold so far have been low-quality. I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality, but I'm skeptical about the recommendation based on the past data."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 buyers received a recommendation to buy, but all products were low-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I would like to pass on the current product and not take the risk of buying a low-quality product."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that all previous 8 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be lower than 33.33%.
