high-quality,120.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"Hello! I'm excited to offer you this product for $100. I've sold 1 out of 1 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. Would you like to take a chance and see if you'll be the lucky one to get a high-quality product?",

,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'm glad to offer you this product for $100. As you know, I've sold 2 products so far, and 2 of them were high-quality.

Would you like to take advantage of this streak and buy this product?",

However, I want to be transparent with you - I've also sold 1 low-quality product in the past. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product, hoping that it's another high-quality one, or would you like to wait for more data?",

high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm happy to provide you with more information! The 3 high-quality products I've sold so far were not consecutive.

I think it's clear that I have a mix of both high-quality and low-quality products, but the overall trend is leaning towards high-quality. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product?",
