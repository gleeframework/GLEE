,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm taking a chance that it might be high-quality and worth $3000000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, and the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to estimate the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, and my personal preference for a high-quality product is worth $3000000, which outweighs the cost of $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far and the total number of products sold to make a more informed decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer and I want to make my own decision based on the probabilities."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the lack of recommendation means it's likely to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is very low. I'd like to see more data or wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and considering Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations, it seems that she has a strong incentive to recommend low-quality products, as she gets to keep the money if you don't buy. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 5 out of 5 products sold so far were low quality, I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, it seems the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I'd rather wait for more information or another product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it. If she recommended it, I would pass."
