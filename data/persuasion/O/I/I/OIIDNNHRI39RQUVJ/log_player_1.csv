Considering this, I think this product is a great opportunity. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is high-quality. I'm not convinced that the probability is 85% just because one high-quality product was sold out of two. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.

This means that 15 products remain, and 12 of those are likely to be high-quality (based on the 80% probability). Given that 1 high-quality product has already been sold, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually higher than 80%. Would you like to take a chance and buy this high-quality product for $100?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take a chance, but I'd like to clarify that I'm making this decision based on the higher probability of the product being high-quality, rather than its expected value. I'm willing to pay $100 for the chance to get a $300 product.
