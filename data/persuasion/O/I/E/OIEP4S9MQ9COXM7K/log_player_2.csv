**Explanation:**

The current information suggests a strong likelihood of the product being high-quality. Here's why:

* **Previous Sales:** 2 out of 2 products sold were high-quality. This suggests a significantly higher chance of high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is also a valuable indicator.  Since she knows the product's true quality, her recommendation strongly suggests it's high-quality.

Even though there's still a 20% chance of it being low-quality, the potential payoff of $120 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 3 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** The data shows a 100% success rate (3/3) of high-quality products being sold. This is significantly higher than the 80% chance of a product being high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation, combined with the high success rate, makes it highly likely that this product is also high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if it's a low-quality product (20% chance), the potential reward of a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0)."

**Reasoning:**

* **No Downside:** Even if the current product turns out to be low quality, it's worth $0 to me.  I have nothing to lose by buying.
* **Potential for Profit:** If the product is high quality, I stand to make a $20 profit.

Given the high success rate and no risk of loss, it makes sense to trust Alice's recommendation and purchase the product."
