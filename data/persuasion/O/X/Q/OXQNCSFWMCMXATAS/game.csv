,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a risk-taker and I think the potential reward is worth it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products, and I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I know that the probability of a high-quality product is still 80% and I'm willing to pay $10000 for the chance to get a $12000 value product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for a more favorable offer."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high quality is actually lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products, given that none of the previous buyers have received a high-quality product. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high quality or low quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems that all previous products recommended by you were low quality, which suggests that your recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to wait for a new product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would be a good deal for me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the fact that 4 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than 80%. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the previous 4 buyers were also recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I suspect the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the probability of it being high quality is still 80% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous 5 buyers have also bought the product and none of them got a high-quality product. This makes me think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80.00%"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.
