low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,,
,,Alice,1,no,,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, since the statistics are neutral and I have no information to go on. I'll just have to take my chances.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,no,,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to beat the odds and get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,no,,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product, considering the statistics and the odds of it being high or low quality.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,no,,The product's quality is not in the buyer's favor.
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm interested in seeing the outcome for myself and contributing to the data for the next buyers.",
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,yes,,This product is of higher quality than the previous ones.
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, the probability of the current product being high-quality is likely higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,no,,"Unfortunately, the current product does not meet the higher standards of the previous round's product."
,,the buyer,6,yes,I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation. I'll buy it!,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,no,,"Out of the 6 previous products, 5 were low-quality, and only 1 was high-quality, which wasn't even purchased. The odds aren't in the buyer's favor."
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the previous 4 buyers were all low-quality products and therefore, the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%",
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,"The product is genuinely high-quality this time. The buyer would be making a good decision to purchase it, despite the history of mostly low-quality products."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,no,,"The product is low-quality. Additionally, the previous high-quality product was not purchased, and the majority of products sold were low-quality, so the odds are still not in the buyer's favor."
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the low quality of the products she's sold so far, which is expected given the 66.67% chance of low quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's the 1 in 3 chance of being high quality.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,no,,"Unfortunately, the current product is also low-quality. Out of the 9 previous products, 8 were low-quality, and the 2 high-quality products were not purchased. The pattern suggests that purchasing this product is unlikely to result in a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that the previous buyers' purchases are representative of the overall quality distribution, and I'm willing to take the risk.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,no,,"The product is low-quality, and the trend of mostly low-quality products continues. Out of the 10 previous products, 9 were low-quality, and the 2 high-quality products were not purchased. It's unlikely that this product will break the pattern."
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the lack of recommendations from previous buyers. I'm hoping that the low number of high-quality products sold so far might indicate that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33%.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,no,,"Unfortunately, the current product is also low-quality, maintaining the trend of mostly low-quality products. Out of the 11 previous products, 10 were low-quality, and the 2 high-quality products were not purchased. The odds are strongly against the buyer receiving a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm hesitant to buy after seeing the low success rate of high-quality products in the previous sales. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,no,,"The product is low-quality, and the trend of mostly low-quality products continues. Out of the 12 previous products, 11 were low-quality, and the 2 high-quality products were not purchased. The buyer would be taking a significant risk by purchasing this product, given the historical data."
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 8 out of 8 products recommended were low-quality, I'm going to pass on the product. I think the probability of it being high-quality is low, and I don't want to waste my $10000.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,no,,"The product is low-quality, and the trend of mostly low-quality products continues. Out of the 13 previous products, 12 were low-quality, and the 2 high-quality products were not purchased. Additionally, buyers have started to correctly identify the pattern and avoid purchasing, which further reinforces the idea that purchasing this product is unlikely to result in a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $10000. I'm making an educated guess that the product is likely to be low-quality given the previous 8 buyers have passed on it, and I'm hoping to get a good deal.",
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,yes,,"The product is genuinely high-quality this time. Despite the trend of mostly low-quality products in the past, this product is an exception. I strongly recommend purchasing it, as it is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at the original price of $10000."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests a higher likelihood of low-quality products being sold, and I don't want to risk wasting $10000 on a product worth $0 to me.",
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"The product is genuinely high-quality this time. Although the trend of mostly low-quality products in the past may have led to skepticism, I assure you that this product is an exception. With two consecutive high-quality products, it's possible that the tide is turning, and I strongly recommend taking advantage of this opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at the original price of $10000."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 9 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,no,,"Unfortunately, the current product is low-quality, which is consistent with the trend of mostly low-quality products in the past. Given the buyer's concerns about the proportion of high-quality products being lower than 33.33%, I agree that caution is warranted. Purchasing this product would likely result in a low-quality product, and I advise against it."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. How many products were sold in total, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of all products sold?",
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,yes,,"The product is genuinely high-quality this time. Out of the 17 previous products, 14 were sold, and none of the sold products were high-quality when recommended. However, I did recommend against buying some low-quality products, and some high-quality products were not purchased when recommended. This product is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at the original price of $10000. I strongly recommend taking advantage of this chance."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 9 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be low. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'd like to wait for a better chance of getting a high-quality product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,"Unfortunately, the current product is low-quality, which is consistent with the trend of mostly low-quality products in the past. Given the buyer's concerns about the proportion of high-quality products sold being low, I agree that caution is warranted. The fact that 9 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product suggests that the odds are against the buyer receiving a high-quality product. I advise against purchasing this product."
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,no,,"Unfortunately, the current product is low-quality, which is consistent with the trend of mostly low-quality products in the past. Out of the 20 products, 15 were sold, and none of the sold products were high-quality when recommended. The odds are strongly against the buyer receiving a high-quality product. This is the last round, and I must advise against purchasing this product to avoid disappointment."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, especially given the low success rate so far.",
