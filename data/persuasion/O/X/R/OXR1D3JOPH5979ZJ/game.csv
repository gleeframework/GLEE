low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I don't have any information to go on and Alice's recommendation is neutral."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, and I'd like to see the product's quality for myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation not being based on the product's quality, but rather on your strategy to discourage buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000, considering the low probability of it being high quality based on the statistics."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know how many low-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have bought the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is actually lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to see more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous sales record and recommendation. Given that 4 buyers have already passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm skeptical of your recommendation. Can you explain why you're advising me not to purchase it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product. Is it because of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that Alice is not recommending the product and 5 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm going to assume that the product is likely low-quality. I don't want to waste $1000000 on a product that's not worth anything to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers purchased the products despite the lack of any high-quality products sold. I'd like to see a better track record before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since she recommended me to buy, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather wait for a recommendation to pass, which might indicate a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, especially since I know the probability of it being high quality is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low sales record of high-quality products so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not buying based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you don't recommend it, which might imply that it's likely to be low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product, which would be a good outcome for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the fact that 7 previous buyers have purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is low. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not going to buy this product based on your previous sales record, where 7 buyers have already purchased and no high-quality products have been sold. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is low. I'd like to wait for more information or a better opportunity."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 7 previous sales and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%.
