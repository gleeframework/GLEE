,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, especially since I know that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on your previous recommendations. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate a bias towards low-quality products.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if the lack of previous sales is due to low-quality products or just bad luck.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have purchased the product despite Alice's recommendation, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 4, and Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm inclined to think it might be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm going to buy it, despite your recommendation, I'm a risk-taker!"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous buyers, who presumably had access to the same information, chose to buy the products, but none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards selling low-quality products, so I'd rather not take the risk."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have already been presented with products, and none of them were high-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it seems likely that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it, and I'm trying to exploit the fact that you don't know my valuation.
