high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! I'll be honest with you, I'm not sure if I can match the same level of discount as last time. However, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1150000. It's still a good deal, considering the true value is $1200000.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your honesty, but the discount is not as attractive as the previous one. Since I know there's a 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, I'll pass on this one and wait for a better deal.",no

,,Alice,5,"I'm glad we could reach a mutually beneficial deal again! Considering the last two high-quality products sold for $1000000 and $1050000, I'll make you a new offer that's slightly higher than the previous one.

,,Bob,5,"Wait, I thought we agreed on $1050000 for the last product, but it seems I got it for $1000000 instead. Regardless, I'm not interested in paying a premium price of $1075000. I'll pass on this one and wait for a better deal.",no

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your position, and I'll make it right. Considering the original deal you got on the first high-quality product was $1000000, I'll sell this new high-quality product to you for the same price. I'll match the original deal: $1000000.

This is a one-time offer, and I'm only selling it to you at this price because of our previous business relationship.",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate your honesty about the product's quality. However, since low-quality products are worth $0 to me, I'm not interested in buying it, even at a discounted price. I'll pass on this one and wait for a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. However, I want to remind you that the 10% discount on the next high-quality product is still valid. If you wait for the next product, you'll get an even better deal on a high-quality item. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $0, as it's worth nothing to you anyway.
