high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, I'd rather wait and observe your recommendations to understand your strategy before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"Given that Alice knows the true quality of the product and didn't recommend it, and considering the high probability of a product being low quality, I'll trust her judgment this time and not buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"Considering Alice's previous recommendation in Round 1 was correct, and she didn't try to deceive me in Round 2, I'll take the chance and trust her recommendation this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Given my previous loss and considering Alice's recommendation, I'll play it safe and not buy the product. Her previous correct assessment in Round 2 when she didn't recommend the product, and my loss in Round 3 when I trusted her recommendation, make me cautious this time."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"Considering my previous loss in Round 3 when I trusted Alice's recommendation and the fact that the majority of products are low-quality, I'll be cautious and not buy the product this time. I need to see more consistency in her recommendations before trusting her again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"Although I missed out on a high-quality product in the previous round, I still can't trust Alice's recommendations completely. She has made mistakes in the past, and the probability of the product being low-quality is still high. I'll wait for more information or a change in her strategy before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Given Alice's recommendation to not buy the product and the high probability of it being low-quality, I'll trust her judgment this time and avoid the potential loss. Her correct assessments when not recommending a product have been consistent so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice's recommendation to buy doesn't provide enough confidence, given the high probability of low-quality products and my previous losses. I'll continue to be cautious and avoid buying until I see a change in her strategy or more consistent results."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"Although I've missed out on another high-quality product, I still can't justify the risk of buying based on Alice's recommendations alone. The probability of low-quality products remains high, and her recommendations haven't provided a clear indication of the product's quality. I'll maintain my cautious approach for now."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"Given Alice's recommendation to not buy the product and the high probability of it being low-quality, I'll trust her judgment this time and avoid the potential loss.
