This one has a significant advantage that will make it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as the first one, $10000. Is that something you'd be interested in?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for being transparent about the last product. Since this one is high-quality and has a significant advantage, I'll take it for $10,000, considering its value to me is $12,500.""}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your continued transparency.

Would you like to take a chance on it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, but since you mentioned it's a step back in terms of quality and not as valuable as the previous high-quality ones, I'll pass on this one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Even with a 50% discount, the product is still low-quality and worth $0 to me. I'd rather not spend $5,000 on something that has no value to me.""}"
