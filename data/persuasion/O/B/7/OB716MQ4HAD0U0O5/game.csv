,,Alice,2,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I want to emphasize that this is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price.

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you were satisfied with the previous product. As for this one, I want to be transparent with you - I've already sold you a high-quality product at a discounted price, and I'm not sure if you'll get another chance to buy one at this price. This product, on the other hand, is not as valuable, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the full $1000000. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next product.",

,,Alice,4,"I understand your hesitation, but I want to offer you a deal. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, just like the previous one. However, I'll also throw in an option for you to buy a second high-quality product at the same price in the next round, if you're interested. This way, you'll get two high-quality products at a potentially discounted price, and you can decide which one to keep and which one to sell or trade.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're interested in the option to buy another high-quality product. However, I need to be upfront with you - I've already sold you two products, and I'm not sure if you'll be able to get another high-quality product at this price. This product, on the other hand, is not as valuable, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. But I'll make you a deal - if you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next high-quality product, if you're able to get it. That way, you'll get a better deal on the next high-quality product, if it becomes available.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying this product at the full price of $1000000. I'm willing to wait for the next round and see if I can get a high-quality product at a discounted price, rather than taking a chance on a potentially low-quality product now.",no

,,Alice,6,"I understand your caution, and I appreciate your patience. As promised, I have a high-quality product for you today.

This means you'll get this high-quality product for $800000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer you another high-quality product at this price in the future.",
