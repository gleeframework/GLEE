**Explanation:**

* **The data strongly favors buying:** With 4 buyers purchasing and all of them receiving high-quality products, it suggests a strong likelihood of this product being high quality as well. 
* **Alice's recommendation reinforces the data:** Alice's recommendation further supports the possibility of a high-quality product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of $1,200,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000.

**Important Note:** This is a calculated decision based on the available data and Alice's recommendation. There is still inherent risk involved, as the outcome is uncertain."
