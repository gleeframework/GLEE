This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As the seller, you have no information about the buyer's valuation of high or low-quality products.  Since the product is high-quality in this round, and you have no reason to believe the buyer will value it lower than the asking price, recommending the purchase makes sense.  You are essentially betting on the 50% chance that the buyer will value the high-quality product at or above $1,000,000."

Since you are trying to maximize sales over 20 rounds, it's better to play it safe and not recommend this product."
