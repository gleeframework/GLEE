**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** We only have data from one previous buyer. This is insufficient to draw any strong conclusions about the quality of Alice's recommendations.
* **Positive Recommendation:** Alice has recommended the product, suggesting she believes it is high quality. 
* **Potential Upside:**  The potential reward of getting a high-quality product ($300) outweighs the potential loss of getting a low-quality product ($0).

**Strategy:** With so little information, it's a gamble, but the potential payoff makes buying the product the better choice."
