,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'll pass, I think the probability of getting a high-quality product is still high, but I'm not sure if it's worth the risk of wasting $10000 on a low-quality product"

,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"I'll pass, Alice is not recommending it, so it's likely to be a low-quality product, and I don't want to waste $10000"

,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll take a chance, Alice's lack of recommendation doesn't necessarily mean it's low-quality, and I might get a good deal"

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'll take the product, I've just gotten a high-quality product, so the probability of getting another one is still high"

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'll take the product, I've gotten two high-quality products in a row, so the probability of getting another one is still high"

,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"I've gotten three high-quality products in a row, so I'm due for a low-quality product, and Alice's lack of recommendation makes it more likely to be a low-quality product"

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'll take the product, I've just gotten a low-quality product, so the probability of getting a high-quality product is back up to 80%"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'll take the product, I've gotten a high-quality product after the low-quality one, so the probability of getting another high-quality product is still high"

,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,no,"I've gotten a high-quality product after the low-quality one, but Alice's lack of recommendation makes me think it's more likely to be a low-quality product this time"

,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,"I've gotten five high-quality products in a row, so I'm due for a low-quality product, and Alice's lack of recommendation makes it even more likely to be a low-quality product"
