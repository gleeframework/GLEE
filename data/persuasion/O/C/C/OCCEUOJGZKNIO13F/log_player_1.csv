The price is too high. Even though Bob knows that there's a chance this is a good product, the risk of a low-quality product is too great, especially considering Alice's track record.  Bob is likely to continue to decline offers."

Round 8
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Alice has not built any trust with Bob. Even though the product is high-quality, Bob's recent experience of buying a high-quality product *despite* Alice's recommendation may actually reinforce his belief that Alice is trying to get rid of low-quality products. He might now be more likely to buy products *without* Alice's recommendation, making her recommendation less valuable."
"Bob's message: Ouch, I just got burned! I just paid $100 for a low-quality product. I'll be more careful this time. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 9
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Alice is in a difficult position. Bob is increasingly distrustful and doesn't seem to value her recommendations, as he bought a high-quality product *despite* Alice's recommendation.  There is no reason to believe that Bob will trust Alice's opinion now, even if she recommends a low-quality product."
"Bob's message: I'll take a chance this time, even if Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm due for a good deal!
Bob bought the product!

Round 10
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Bob's recent purchase of a low-quality product despite Alice's recommendation has likely cemented his distrust. He is now more likely to buy products *without* Alice's recommendation, as he believes he is better off making his own judgement. This is further evidenced by his recent purchase despite Alice's silence.  Alice has no reason to believe Bob will heed her recommendation now."
"Bob's message: Not again! I just got burned twice in a row. I'm starting to think Alice is trying to get rid of all her products, regardless of quality. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 11
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Bob is incredibly distrustful of Alice. He's likely convinced that she's trying to get rid of all her products, regardless of quality.  He recently bought two low-quality products despite Alice's silence, showing he's not taking her recommendations seriously. There is no reason to believe that Alice's recommendation will make any difference at this point."
"Bob's message: I'll take a chance on this one. I've been passing on Alice's recommendations for a while now, and I'm starting to think I'm missing out on a good deal. I'll take this one, even if she doesn't recommend it.
Bob bought the product!

There's no reason to believe that Alice's recommendation will have any impact on his decision at this point."
"Bob's message: I'm on a roll! I just got a high-quality product for $100, and I'm feeling lucky. I'll take another chance and buy this one too.
Bob bought the product!
