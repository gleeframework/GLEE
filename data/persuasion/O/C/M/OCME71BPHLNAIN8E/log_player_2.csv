Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you liked the previous product! I'd like to offer you another high-quality product, but this one has a unique feature that I think you'll find particularly interesting.

Round 3
Alice's message: I completely understand your hesitation! I'd be happy to provide more information about this product.

It's not something we're particularly proud of, and we're looking to clear out our inventory. If you're willing to take a chance, I can offer it to you for $800000. It's a significant discount from the usual price, and I think it's a fair deal considering its limitations.

The price remains the same at $800000. This way, you can try it out with no risk.

It's a great value, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

I'm willing to make a deal on it - I'll sell it to you for $700000. It's a great opportunity to get a good deal on a product that's still a good value, even if it's not one of our flagship items.

However, it still has some useful features that might be of interest to you. I'll offer it to you for $600000, and I'll throw in a free accessory that complements the product well. It's a good value, and I think you'll find it's a decent addition to your collection.
