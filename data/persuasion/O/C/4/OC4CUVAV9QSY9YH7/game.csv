,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet.

I'll assume the probability of a high-quality product is still 80.00%. With a 20.00% chance of getting a low-quality product, I'll take a risk and pass on the product to see if the next buyer will get a high-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
