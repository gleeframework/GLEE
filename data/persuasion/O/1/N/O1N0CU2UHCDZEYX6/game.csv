,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product for $1000000. I want to assure you that this is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on all the risk. If you're interested, I'll provide you with a detailed description of the product, but I want to emphasize that it's a low-quality product. I'm only offering this to you because I believe you might be able to find some value in it. Please let me know if you're willing to take a chance.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your decision last round, and I appreciate your honesty. This round's product is also a low-quality item, but I want to offer you a different perspective. Think of it as a 'learning experience' - if you don't buy it, you'll never know what could have been. On the other hand, if you do buy it, you'll have the opportunity to learn from it and potentially gain some insight. The price remains the same at $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your creative spin on the product, but I'm not convinced that the potential 'learning experience' is worth $1000000. I'll pass on this low-quality product as well.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I respect that. This round's product is also low-quality, and I'm not going to try to spin it as a 'learning experience' this time. Instead, I'll be upfront with you - I'm willing to make a deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 50/50 chance to buy the next product at a significantly discounted price. If you don't buy this one, the offer is off the table. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a potential future discount. I'm waiting for a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've been transparent about the product's quality, and you've made it clear what you're looking for. I want to make one more offer to you. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a sealed envelope with a note inside that will reveal the quality of the next product. You'll get to know whether it's high-quality or low-quality before you decide to buy it. The price remains $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the promise of information about the next product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product and take my chances without the information.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've tried various approaches, and you've consistently shown a preference for waiting for a high-quality product. I'm willing to take a different tack. This round's product is also low-quality, but I want to ask you a question: are you willing to pay $500000 for this product? It's a significant discount from the original price, and it's a one-time offer. If you're interested, I'll sell it to you at this price, and we can move on to the next round.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a lower price. I'm still waiting for a high-quality product at the original price of $1000000.",no

,,Alice,7,"I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating with me. Given that you've seen 6 low-quality products in a row, I want to ask you to reconsider your stance on this one. You've already invested 6 rounds of time and effort into our negotiation, and this product is essentially a sunk cost. I'm willing to offer you a 'no-strings-attached' guarantee: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a full refund if you don't like it. The price remains $1000000. What do you think?",
