,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the probability of it being high-quality, not based on your recommendation."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the products? What was the quality of the products they bought?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is there a reason you think it's low quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers passed on the product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than the expected 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you've recommended against it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm not sure if I'm just throwing my money away."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I think it's better to pass on this product and potentially let someone else buy it, which might increase the chances of a high-quality product being sold in the future."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product, and I'd like to see the statistics again after I make my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious about the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record. I'm not relying on your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products Alice is offering may be low-quality, and I don't want to risk wasting $10000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the statistics, it seems like most products are low quality. I'd like to see more evidence of high-quality products being sold before making a purchase."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 7, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 7 out of 7 products recommended have been low-quality, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendation is not reliable.
