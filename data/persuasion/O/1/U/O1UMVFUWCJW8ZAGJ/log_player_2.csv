  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products is 0. I'll use Bayes' theorem to update the probability of the product being high-quality. Assuming the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, the probability of a product being low-quality is 66.67%. If I pass, the probability of the next product being high-quality will increase to 33.33% * (3/4) / (3/4 + 1/4) = 75%. If I buy and it's low-quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality will decrease to 33.33% * (2/4) / (2/4 + 1/4) = 40%. I'll pass to increase the chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round.""
