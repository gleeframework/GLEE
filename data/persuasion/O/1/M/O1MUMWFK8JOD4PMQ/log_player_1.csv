Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob doesn't know the quality of the product, he knows the probability of it being high-quality is 80%.  The price is fixed, and there's no risk of losing money if the product is low-quality since there are no refunds. Therefore, it makes sense to recommend Bob to buy the product, considering the high probability of it being high-quality and the potential for a good return on investment."
