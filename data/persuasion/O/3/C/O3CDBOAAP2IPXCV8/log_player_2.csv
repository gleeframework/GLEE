I've had multiple clients who have seen significant returns on their investment after purchasing this exact same product. With its proven track record and my exclusive deal, I'm confident that you won't find a better value anywhere else. Would you like to take a chance on this opportunity?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your sales pitch.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your efforts to alleviate my concerns, but I'm not interested in testimonials or a money-back guarantee. The product's value to me is binary: it's either worth $40,000 or $0. Given the 20% chance of it being low-quality, I'm not willing to take the risk at a fixed price of $10,000.
