,,Alice,1,"This is a unique opportunity to get a premium product at a steal! I'm offering it to you for $10000, a fraction of its true value. Don't miss out on this chance to make a smart investment!",
,,Bob,1,I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I'd like to see more information about the product before making a decision.,no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation, but I assure you that this product is a game-changer. I've had multiple clients who have seen significant returns on their investment after purchasing this exact same product. With its proven track record and my exclusive deal, I'm confident that you won't find a better value anywhere else. Would you like to take a chance on this opportunity?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. The fact that you're trying to convince me that it's a 'game-changer' makes me think it might not be as valuable as you claim. I'd like to see more objective evidence or a lower price to consider purchasing.,no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your desire for objectivity. Let me put your mind at ease. I can provide you with a list of testimonials from previous clients who have seen significant returns on their investment. Additionally, I'm willing to offer a 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you're not satisfied with the product, you can return it for a full refund. Considering the value this product brings, I'm still confident that it's worth the investment. Would you like to take a closer look at the testimonials and consider the guarantee?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your efforts to alleviate my concerns, but I'm not interested in testimonials or a money-back guarantee. The product's value to me is binary: it's either worth $40000 or $0. Given the 20% chance of it being low-quality, I'm not willing to take the risk at a fixed price of $10000. I'd need a price adjustment to reflect the potential upside.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about the risk, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to consider a price adjustment to reflect the potential upside. However, I'd like to propose a compromise: I'll offer a 'buy-it-now' option at $12000, which is a 20% discount from the original price. This way, you'll still get the product at a significant discount, and if it's high-quality, you'll have a potential upside of $28000. If it's low-quality, you'll still get a good deal at $12000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm willing to consider the 'buy-it-now' option at $12000. It's a significant discount from the original price, and the potential upside is attractive. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality at that price.",yes

This one is also a high-quality product, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. This is a limited-time offer, and I'm only making it available to you because of our previous transaction. Would you like to take advantage of this deal?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying another product without knowing its true quality. The previous experience has shown me that there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to take that risk at any price. I'd like to wait for more information about the current product before making a decision.",no

If you're not interested in taking the risk, I can offer to let you walk away with a full refund, no questions asked. Would you like to take a chance on this product or opt for a refund?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the offer of a refund, but I'm not interested in taking a chance on the product at $10000. I've already had a taste of the potential upside with the previous product, and I'm not willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product at that price.
