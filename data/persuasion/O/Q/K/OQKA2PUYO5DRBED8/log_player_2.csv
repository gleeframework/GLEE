"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product has a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality, and the potential gain from a high-quality product is significantly higher than the potential loss from a low-quality product, it's strategically beneficial to buy the product. It's a gamble, but with the odds being even, it's a gamble worth taking in this scenario."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm feeling lucky!  Let's go for it again.""}
```

The previous round's success doesn't change the fundamental 50/50 odds for each new product.  The potential gain is still much higher than the potential loss, making it a good gamble to continue."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is now a valuable piece of information.  Since she's not recommending the product, it suggests she might have some insight into its quality.
