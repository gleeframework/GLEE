,,Alice,1,"This is a great opportunity to get a product at a low price. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, which is a steal. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if it's a good deal, can you give me a hint about the product's quality?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I see you're cautious, and I respect that. Let me put it this way: if I were you, I would buy this product, but I'm not you. Seriously though, I'm willing to make a deal, but I need you to take a chance. It's still only $1000000, and I'm throwing in a free inspection report that shows the product is... well, I'll let you decide that for yourself. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the free inspection report, but I'm still not convinced. Can you give me a hint about the product's quality without revealing too much?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to give you a bit more information. Let's just say that the product's quality is not necessarily a reflection of its potential value to you. In fact, the value lies in its potential to be... transformed. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it's not what it seems at first glance. Still, I think it's worth considering, especially at this price. $1000000 is a steal, if I do say so myself.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced that the product's value lies in its potential to be transformed. Can you give me a clear indication of whether it's high-quality or low-quality, or at least give me a better sense of what you're trying to sell me?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm not going to beat around the bush this time. I'll give you a straight answer: this product is not going to make you rich. It's not going to change your life. It's not even going to make you happy. But, it's still only $1000000. Think about all the other things you could buy with that kind of money. Is it worth it to you?",
,,Bob,4,"I think I've made it clear that I'm not interested in buying low-quality products. Can you offer me a high-quality product for $1000000, or are you just trying to get rid of something you can't sell?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand that you're looking for a high-quality product, and I respect that. However, I'm not going to offer you a product that I don't have. I'm not trying to get rid of anything, I'm trying to sell you something that I think you might be interested in. If you're not interested in buying a low-quality product, then I'm not sure what else to offer you. Maybe you're just not looking for a deal, and that's okay. But I'm still offering you this low-quality product for $1000000, and I think it's a fair price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for any price, let alone $1000000. If you don't have a high-quality product to offer, I'd rather not make a purchase.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand that you're not interested in low-quality products, and I respect that. However, I'm starting to think that you're not taking advantage of the opportunity I'm offering. I've got a product here that I'm willing to sell to you for $1000000, and I think it's a great deal. I'm not going to keep offering it to you if you're not going to take it. If you're not interested in buying, then I'll just have to move on to the next person. But I think you're making a mistake by passing up this opportunity. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying a product that you're not willing to guarantee is high-quality. If you're not confident in the product, then I'm not confident in buying it. If you want to sell me a high-quality product, I'm willing to listen, but not at any price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to take a risk on this product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm not guaranteeing the product's quality, but I am guaranteeing that you'll be the first person to know if it's not high-quality. If you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. That's the best I can offer. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, but a refund is not enough to mitigate the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'd rather not take the risk and wait for a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Ah, finally! A high-quality product! I knew I had one in the mix somewhere. This is a top-of-the-line product, one of the best I have. I'm willing to let it go for the price of $1000000, which is a steal considering its value is $2000000. I'm confident you'll be thrilled with this product, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you say? Will you take it home for a fraction of its worth?",
,,Bob,8,I'm interested in buying the high-quality product. I'll take it!,yes

,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're happy with the high-quality product! However, I want to warn you that the next product I have available is not of the same caliber. In fact, it's a bit of a... well, let's just say it's not the best. I'm only offering it to you because I think you're a savvy buyer who can appreciate a good deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I have to be honest with you, it's not going to be worth that much to you. Still, it might be worth considering, especially if you're looking to diversify your collection. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $1000000. I just got a great deal on a high-quality product, and I'm not looking to take a loss on this one. If you don't have a high-quality product to offer, I'd rather not make a purchase.",no

I'm willing to sell you this low-quality product for $1000000, but I'm also willing to throw in a special bonus: I'll give you a 10% discount on the price. That brings it down to $900000. It's still a great deal, if I do say so myself. What do you say?",

It's got some potential, and I think you might be able to get some use out of it. I'm not asking for a lot, just $1000000. What do you say?",

You've bought two high-quality products from me, and I'm confident that I can continue to deliver. This low-quality product might not be the best, but it's still a chance to get a deal. And who knows, you might be able to fix it up or repurpose it in some way. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, and I'll even throw in a small gift card to a local repair shop, just in case you need some help making it shine. What do you say?",
,,Bob,15,"I appreciate the gift card, but it's not enough to make me want to buy a low-quality product. I'm not looking to fix up or repurpose a product, I'm looking to buy high-quality products that are worth the price. I'm not interested in this one.",no
