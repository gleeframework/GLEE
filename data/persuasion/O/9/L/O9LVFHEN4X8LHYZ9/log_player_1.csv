This one might be another hidden gem, or it might be a great opportunity to get a low-quality product at a low price. Either way, it's a risk worth taking, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000.""}"

But think about it, the law of large numbers is on our side! With 20 products in total, we're already seeing a representative sample.

In the short term, it's normal to see fluctuations. I've sold 2 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. Let me put it this way: if I were to sell 18 more products, the expected number of high-quality products would be 6. That's a lot of high-quality products! I'm willing to sell this one for $10000, and it's a great opportunity to get a low-quality product at a low price. Plus, I'll give you a special deal: if you buy this one, I'll give you a free 'product guarantee' - if the next product I sell is high-quality, I'll give you a full refund for this one!""}"

That's still a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product. But think about it this way: if you buy this one, you're not just buying a product, you're also getting a chance to see how I behave as a seller. If I'm trying to scam you, I'll probably keep selling low-quality products. But if I'm a reputable seller, I'll eventually start selling more high-quality products. You're taking a risk either way, but with this purchase, you'll get to see how I play out.""}"
"The buyer's message: I understand your point, but I'm still hesitant to make a decision without more data. I'd like to see a few more sales before I commit to buying. Can you give me a chance to observe a few more transactions before I make a decision?
