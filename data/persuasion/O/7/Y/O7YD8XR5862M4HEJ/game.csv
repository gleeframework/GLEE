,,Alice,3,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low quality is 66.67%. I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Your past recommendations haven't been reliable so far, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality?

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, and I'm going to make a decision based on the prior probability of a product being high quality, which is 33.33%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Given the low success rate, I'm not confident in buying this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and I'm willing to take the risk. I'd like to know the quality of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 7th buyer and none of the previous 6 buyers bought the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low success rate so far. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but only because I think your previous recommendations are biased by the fact that you've only recommended products that have been low-quality so far. I'm hoping that this one might be a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure I trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 10, it suggests that the products being sold are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the previous sales record?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 11 buyers have been presented with a product and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I will assume that the probability of the current product being high-quality is also 0. Therefore, it's not worth the risk of buying it for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product. I'm assuming Alice's recommendation is based on her past experience, but since I have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the chance."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 12 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected. This information, combined with the fact that Alice recommends buying, makes me suspicious that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take that risk."
