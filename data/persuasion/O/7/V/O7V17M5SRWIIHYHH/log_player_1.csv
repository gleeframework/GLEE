Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 
The buyer knows that 33.33% of your products are high quality, and you've been selling for 14 rounds now. The buyer has seen that you've never recommended a product to them. As an intelligent buyer, they might start to think that you're only recommending products when you know they're high quality. So, even though you have a low success rate in selling so far, this time you should recommend the product."

Round 17
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

The buyer hasn't bought any products yet, even though you have been offering high-quality products. This suggests they are extremely risk-averse. This is your chance to potentially change their mind. Even though your recommendation record is poor, it's still worthwhile to recommend the product.  You have a decent chance of the buyer finally taking a gamble."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to wait and see if the product is high-quality before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 18

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

The buyer has still not bought any products, even after you've offered several high-quality ones.  They're clearly very risk-averse, but they have a good chance of getting a very good deal this round if they buy. Keep pushing for a sale, even if you have to be a bit more insistent this time."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to wait and see if I can get a high-quality product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 product sold so far, I'm not confident in this product's quality.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 19

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
You've recommended the product a few times now, and the buyer is still extremely reluctant to buy. This suggests they're very risk-averse.  You shouldn't recommend a product if you know it's low-quality. They're unlikely to buy anyway, and you'll only further reinforce their perception of you as unreliable."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to wait and see how the next product turns out, given that the first buyer didn't find a high-quality product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 20
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

This is your final round, and you've still not had a single successful sale. You've recommended several high-quality products, but the buyer has always declined. This suggests they are extremely risk-averse. Your best strategy is to continue recommending the product in hopes of convincing them to take a gamble. There is a chance that you might finally get a sale. If you don't recommend the product, you're guaranteed to end the game with no sales."
