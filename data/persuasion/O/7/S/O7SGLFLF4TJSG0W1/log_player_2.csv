**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The data shows that 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This is significantly higher than the 33.33% chance of a product being high quality. 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Since Alice knows the value of each product to you, she has a strong incentive to recommend only high-quality products to maximize her sales. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there is still a chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk. 

**Note:** This strategy is based on the assumption that Alice is acting rationally and aiming to maximize her profits. If there is suspicion that Alice is not acting in good faith, the decision would need to be reevaluated."
