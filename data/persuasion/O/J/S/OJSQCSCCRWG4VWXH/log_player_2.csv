Alice's message: You're the sixth buyer in a row to take the risk, and all six have been high-quality. While the probability remains 80%, it's clear that I've had a streak of good luck. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the odds are still 80%, but I'll give you a slight nudge: I'll throw in a guarantee that if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of the $10000, and we'll start fresh.
