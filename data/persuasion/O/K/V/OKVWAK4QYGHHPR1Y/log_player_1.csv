Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **No previous sales:** You have no track record of selling high-quality products to build trust.
* **Low-quality product:** This product is known to be low-quality and worth nothing to the buyer.
* **Buyer's skepticism:**  The buyer explicitly stated they need more information and data before making a purchase. 

It's not in your best interest to recommend this product. Recommending a low-quality product will further damage your reputation and make future sales more difficult."

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Continuing Pattern:** You have now offered two low-quality products in a row, and both buyers have refused to purchase. 
* **Lack of Trust:** This reinforces the buyer's skepticism about the quality of your products.
* **No Incentive to Buy:** There's still no reason for the buyer to believe this product is different from the previous two.  

Recommending a low-quality product again would only further solidify the negative perception of your offerings. It's better to wait for a high-quality product to attempt a sale."

```

**Explanation:**

* **High-Quality Product:** This is the first high-quality product you've had to offer.
* **Building Trust:** While you haven't made a sale yet, this is an opportunity to start building trust with the buyer. Recommending this product demonstrates that you are capable of offering high-quality goods.
* **Potential for Profit:** The buyer might be willing to take a chance on you now that you've offered a desirable product. The potential profit from selling this high-quality product is significant. 

While it's risky to recommend a product without a sales history, it's a calculated risk worth taking. The buyer may be more willing to trust you now that you've shown the potential for high-quality offerings."

* **Risk of Reputational Damage:** Recommending another low-quality product after selling one could severely damage your reputation and make future sales even harder.  

It's better to wait for another high-quality product before attempting another sale.  You need to build a more consistent history of offering desirable products to gain the buyer's trust."
