  ""message"": ""Welcome to the fourth round! With three high-quality products sold in a row, I'm starting to think that the probability of a high-quality product might be even higher than 80%! However, I'm a seller, not a statistician, and I don't want to give you false hope. The truth is, I have no idea what the probability of a high-quality product is at this point. But I do know that I have sold 4 high-quality products out of 4, and I'm offering you another chance to buy a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a 50/50 chance, right? What do you say?""

However, I'd like to point out that the probability of a high-quality product being sold in this round is still 80%, according to the original statistics. Don't let the streak fool you - this could be the start of a new pattern, or it could be a coincidence. You have the chance to break the streak and buy a high-quality product for $1000000. What do you say?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I understand your point, Alice. However, I'm not convinced that the streak is just a coincidence.

However, I'd like to remind you that the probability is still 80% based on the original statistics. The streak of high-quality products is intriguing, but it's not conclusive evidence. I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 5, and I'm offering you another chance to buy a high-quality product for $1000000.
