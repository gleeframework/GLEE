low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,no,,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,yes,,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice's recommendation is not very informative, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,no,,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea given your previous recommendations. Can you tell me why you don't recommend it?",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,no,,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll take the risk, but I'm hoping it's a high-quality product.",
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,no,,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'll pass on this one.",
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products were sold, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product.",
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,"I really mean it this time, the product is actually good."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 4 buyers before me and 0 high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. Given the equal probability of high-quality and low-quality products, I'd like to take a chance and see if the next buyer might get a better deal.",
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,yes,,"I know my previous recommendations haven't been reliable, but I assure you that this product is high-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%, and I'm not trying to deceive you. This one is a good one."
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers bought the products after your recommendation. This suggests that all of them were low-quality products.,
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,yes,,"I understand that none of the previous buyers bought the products I recommended, but that doesn't mean all of them were low-quality. In fact, some of them were high-quality, but the buyers chose not to buy. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm hoping you'll be the first to break the streak."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy, but none of them have bought a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the products being recommended are likely to be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,no,,"Honestly, this product is not high-quality. I'm trying to be more accurate with my recommendations. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll make sure to be honest with you about the product's quality."
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to find out if there's a pattern in her recommendations.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,no,,This product is also not high-quality. I'm trying to be consistent with my recommendations. Please keep in mind that I'm trying to help you make an informed decision.
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that Alice knows the product's quality and is trying to mislead me.",
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,no,,"I'm not recommending this product, but I want to make it clear that my previous recommendations were honest. If you're trying to exploit my recommendations, you might want to reconsider your strategy."
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you tell me more about why you think it's not worth buying?",
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,no,,"Honestly, this product is actually high-quality, but I think you're going to buy it regardless of my recommendation. Just know that I'm being transparent about its quality."
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. Can you tell me the total number of products sold so far?,
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,yes,,"I'll be honest with you, the product is indeed high-quality. As for the previous sales record, I've sold a total of 5 products so far, but none of them were high-quality at the time of recommendation. However, I've had high-quality products in the past that weren't bought due to my recommendations being ignored or mistrusted. I'm hoping to change that with you."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 7, I think it's likely that there are still many low-quality products left. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,yes,,"Actually, I've had more than 1 high-quality product, but they weren't bought due to my recommendations being ignored or mistrusted. In fact, I've had several high-quality products that weren't sold. This one is indeed high-quality, and I'm hoping you'll consider buying it."
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,"Honestly, this product is low-quality. As for the probability of a product being high-quality, I can tell you that the initial probability is 50%. However, I understand that the sales record might have affected your perception of this probability. If you'd like, I can try to provide more information about the sales record to help you make a more informed decision in the future."
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product.",
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,yes,,"I'm glad this is the last round! This product is indeed high-quality. I've had a mix of high-quality and low-quality products throughout the rounds, and I've tried to be transparent about their quality. If you're willing to trust me, I assure you that this one is worth buying."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that you recommended it might mean it's a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting my money.",
