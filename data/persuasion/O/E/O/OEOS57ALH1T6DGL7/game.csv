high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now, and let you know that I'm aware that the product has a 80.00% chance of being high quality and a 20.00% chance of being low quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product if I get a chance to see the previous sales record after this transaction."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'm not going to buy the product yet. I need more information about the quality of the products in general.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see the outcome of the first product before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm not sure what the quality is, and I'd rather take the risk than have the product go to waste."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision. Can you provide the probability based on the current sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product and I can get a good deal."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 2 buyers have already passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, I'm going to assume that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is lower than the overall 80% probability. I'll wait for a product that has been passed on by at least one buyer before."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the odds of the product being high-quality are still 80.00%."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that this product might be low quality as well."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products since no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, and none of the products sold were high quality, I'm concerned that your recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that all previous buyers who received a recommendation to buy also ended up buying the product, but none of those products were high-quality. I think this suggests that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards getting buyers to purchase, and I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is there something in the data that suggests this product is low-quality?

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see the statistics again after I pass on it to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather not risk losing $10000 on a product that's worthless to me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have received low-quality products, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd like to see more information about the sales record before making a decision."
