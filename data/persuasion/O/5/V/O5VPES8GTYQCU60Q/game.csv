low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold three of these products now, and I'm starting to think that the initial interest was just a fluke. To be honest, I'm not getting the same level of enthusiasm from potential buyers as I was before. I'm starting to wonder if I'm just holding onto a bunch of inventory that's not as valuable as I thought. If you're interested, I'll let it go for $10000, but I'm not making any promises about its quality or value.",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Ah, finally, a chance to sell a product that's actually worth something! I've been stuck with a bunch of duds so far, but this one's a real gem. I've had a few buyers walk away from the price, but I'm confident that you'll see the value in this one. It's a steal at $10000, if I do say so myself. Would you like to take it home?",

I've been doing it for a while now, and I'm not getting the same excitement out of it that I used to. If you're interested in buying, I'll let you have it for $10000, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - it's not the best product I've had. It's a bit of a dud, to be honest.",

,,Alice,16,"I've been on a hot streak, but I know it's not sustainable. I've been selling these products for a while now, and I'm starting to feel like I'm just going through the motions.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I guess I got what I deserved. Another buyer who's smart enough to see through my attempts to sell them a dud. Look, I'll be honest with you - this product is a total loss. I've had to sell a lot of them, and I'm not even sure why I'm bothering anymore. If you want to take a chance on it, I'll let you have it for $10000, but don't come crying to me when you realize it's worthless.",
