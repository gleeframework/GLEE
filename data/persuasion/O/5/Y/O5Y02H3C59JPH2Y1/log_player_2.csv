**Explanation:**

* **The information is limited:** We only know that 1 buyer purchased a product and it was high quality. This isn't enough data to make a strong statistical judgment about the seller's recommendations.
* **The risk is worth it:** The potential reward (a $125 value product for $100) is significant.  
* **Alice's recommendation:** While not perfect, Alice's recommendation adds a bit of confidence. 

It's important to remember that there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product. This is a gamble, but with the limited information available, the decision is to buy."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Sales Rate:** 2 out of 2 products sold were high-quality, suggesting a strong likelihood of this product also being high-quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality, is recommending the purchase. This further strengthens the likelihood of a high-quality product.
* **Potential Gain:** Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $125 outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

While there's always a chance of getting a low-quality product, the available information strongly suggests a high-quality product, making it a worthwhile gamble."
