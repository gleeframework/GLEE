high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm not going to make a profit on this one, but I need to make a sale to continue the business. If you don't buy this one, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'll buy it since you've assured me it's high-quality and the price is reasonable.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! However, I have to inform you that this next product is not as good as the previous one. It's still a great opportunity to make a good deal, though. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1000000. Think about it, you're getting a chance to buy a product at a price that's 2/3 of its true value, considering the probability of it being high-quality. It's a risk, but it could be a great investment!",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your honesty about the product's quality, but given that you've explicitly stated it's not as good as the previous one and considering the 66.67% chance of it being low-quality, I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your decision last time, but I'd like to offer you a chance to reconsider. Since you've already passed on one low-quality product, you know what to expect. This one is also not high-quality, but I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1000000. Think about it as an opportunity to get a 'free' product, since you're not paying more than what you would have paid for a high-quality product. You've already taken the risk once, and now you have a chance to get a second one for the same price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that you've admitted is not high-quality and is likely worth $0 to me. I'll wait for a better opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'll sell you this product for $750000. It's a significant discount from the original price, and it's a chance for you to get a good deal on a product that's not as valuable as the high-quality ones. You've already seen two low-quality products, so you know what to expect. This is a chance to get a 'bad' product at a 'good' price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the discount, but even at $750000, it's still not a good deal for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worth $0 to me. I'll wait for a high-quality product or a more substantial discount that reflects the true value of the product.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're being cautious with your investments. I appreciate that. Now, I have a high-quality product for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. You've seen two low-quality products and one high-quality product, so you know the value of a high-quality product. I'm willing to give you a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy, regardless of its quality. This way, you'll have a chance to get a better deal on the next product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,I'm willing to buy this product since you've assured me it's high-quality and the price is reasonable. The additional guarantee of a 10% discount on the next product is also a nice bonus. I'll take the deal.,yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you liked the last product and the guarantee! Now, I have another high-quality product for you. However, I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I'm giving you a discount of $100000 from the original price, and you already know the value of a high-quality product. You've got a 10% discount on the next product waiting for you, so think about it as getting a high-quality product at a price that's still below its true value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the discount, and I'm willing to buy this product since you've assured me it's high-quality. With the discounted price of $900000 and considering the 10% discount I have waiting for the next product, I think it's a good deal. I'll take it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're happy with the last two purchases! Now, I have a product for you, but I'll be honest with you, it's not as good as the previous ones. However, I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as the last one: $900000. Think about it as getting a 'bad' product at a 'good' price. You've already got a 10% discount on the next product, so you'll get a better deal on the next one regardless of what happens with this one. Plus, you've bought two high-quality products in a row, so you know the value of a good investment. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not willing to pay $900000 for a product that you've admitted is not as good as the previous ones. Considering the 66.67% chance of it being low-quality and worth $0 to me, I don't think it's a good investment. I'll wait for a better opportunity and use my 10% discount on a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your decision, and I respect your caution. However, I'd like to make a special offer. Since you've already passed on this low-quality product, I'll give you an even better deal on the next one. I'll sell it to you for $600000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and it's a chance for you to get a 'bad' product at an 'even better' price. Plus, you still have that 10% discount waiting for you on the next high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the deeper discount, but even at $600000, I'm not willing to take the risk on a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worth $0 to me. I'll wait for a high-quality product and use my 10% discount to get a better deal on something that's actually valuable to me.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I see you're being very selective with your investments. I respect that. Now, I have a high-quality product for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. You've already used your 10% discount on a previous purchase, but I'll give you another chance to use it. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 15% discount on the next product you buy, regardless of its quality. This way, you'll get an even better deal on the next product. What do you say?",

I'm giving you a discount of $100000 from the original price, and you already know the value of a high-quality product. Plus, you've got a 15% discount waiting for you on the next product. Think about it as getting a high-quality product at a price that's even lower than its true value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the discount, and I'm willing to buy this product since you've assured me it's high-quality. With the discounted price of $800000 and considering the 15% discount I have waiting for the next product, I think it's a great deal. I'll take it.",yes

,,Alice,13,"I see you're being very selective with your investments. I respect that. However, I'd like to remind you that you've already passed on three low-quality products, and you've bought five high-quality products in a row.
