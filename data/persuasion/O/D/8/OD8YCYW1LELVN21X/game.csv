low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure what to expect."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, which might indicate it's a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous two buyers didn't buy, which might indicate a higher likelihood of the product being low-quality. However, I also know that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take that risk. I'd like to make my own decision based on the information I have."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is 0%. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. Given the low price of $100, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for that price."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far and the high probability of it being low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that you haven't recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and I'd like to see the updated statistics after my decision, including the total number of buyers and the proportion of high-quality products sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product, but I'm expecting a high-quality product based on the low probability of high-quality products being sold so far."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 products recommended were low-quality, I'm skeptical of the recommendation and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product's quality and the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales data?
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 products were recommended to buy and none were high-quality, I suspect that Alice is trying to manipulate the sales by recommending low-quality products. I'd like to see the next product and its recommendation before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,I'm willing to take the risk despite the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the first one to get a high-quality product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that it's high-quality based on the previous sales record."

,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not going to buy it based on your previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite the odds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, 7 out of 7 products were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it seems like the products being sold are more likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the current statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, and I'm not confident that the product I'm being offered is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that you're recommending it. I'm not confident that this product is high-quality."
