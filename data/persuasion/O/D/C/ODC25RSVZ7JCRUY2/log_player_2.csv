Alice's message: This is a one-time offer of a unique product. It's a rare opportunity to make a purchase at a discounted price of $100. Don't miss out on this chance to acquire a product at a fraction of its true value. I assure you, this product is worth so much more than what you're paying.

Alice's message: I understand your concern about the probability of getting a high-quality product. However, I'd like to point out that you're not paying for the product's quality, you're paying for the opportunity to potentially get it. Since you're not interested in the product itself, but rather the possibility of getting a high-quality one, I'd be happy to offer you a chance to buy a product that has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, for the low price of $100. It's a risk-free investment, and you can't lose anything!

Alice's message: I've sold 2 products so far, and neither of them were high-quality. While it's true that the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer is still 33.33%, it's worth noting that the law of large numbers suggests that as the number of sales increases, the observed frequency of high-quality products should converge to the true probability. With only 2 sales, the observed frequency is 0%, which is a bit lower than the true probability. I'm offering you a chance to buy a product with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's still a great opportunity to potentially get a high-quality product at a low price.

Alice's message: Congratulations on taking the risk and buying the product! Unfortunately, it's a low-quality product. I'm glad you're aware of the true probability of 33.33% and the potential value of a high-quality product. Now, let me put things into perspective: you just spent $100 on a product worth $0 to you. If you had bought the product in round 1, you would have had a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $400, which would have been a great deal. Now, you have a 66.67% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100. Don't let this opportunity slip away!

Alice's message: I completely understand your decision to wait for the next round. It's a smart move, given the odds. However, I'd like to point out that the probability of getting a high-quality product in the next round is still 33.33%, just like it was in the previous rounds. The fact that you didn't buy this low-quality product doesn't change the probability of the next one. You're essentially giving up a guaranteed $100 product for a chance at a potentially $400 product. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $100, and you can still take your chances on the next round.

Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! You're considering the potential impact of the previous buyer's decision on the probability of the next product. I'll give you a hint: the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. The previous buyer's decision doesn't affect the probability of the next product. Think about it this way: even if the previous buyer had bought this low-quality product, the probability of the next product being high-quality would still be 33.33%. You're not missing out on any information by waiting for the next round, and you're still facing the same 66.67% chance of getting a high-quality product if you buy it now.

However, I'd like to point out that the law of large numbers is starting to kick in. With 5 sales and no high-quality products, the observed frequency is 0%, which is a bit lower than the true probability. It's possible that we're just experiencing a streak of bad luck.

Alice's message: I see you're being cautious and waiting for more sales to confirm the true probability. Well, I'm happy to report that the law of large numbers is indeed working in our favor! With 2 high-quality products out of 9 sales, the observed frequency is now 22.22%, which is closer to the true probability of 33.33%.

However, I'd like to point out that the observed frequency of high-quality products is now 2/10, which is still lower than the true probability of 33.33%. But, I'd like to highlight that we've just had two consecutive high-quality products, which is a remarkable streak!
