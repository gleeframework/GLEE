{""decision"": ""no""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you know my valuation and are trying to manipulate me, and I'm hoping that your recommendation is based on the product being low quality.

Round 10
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","The buyer is trying to calculate the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Let's do the math:

3 purchases, 0 high-quality products sold, and 7 low-quality products sold. The total number of products sold is 7 + 3 = 10.

The probability of a product being high-quality is 2/10 = 0.2 or 20%.

However, the buyer is considering only the 3 purchases, not the total number of products. They are correct that the proportion of high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases is 0.

The probability of the product being high-quality based on the 3 purchases is indeed 0, since no high-quality products were sold out of those 3 purchases.

Given this information, I'll not recommend the product, as the buyer is likely to think it's low-quality and I don't want to sell another low-quality product.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, and you're not recommending it, I'm inclined to believe the product might be low-quality. I'll pass on it.

The statistics are: 9 low-quality products, 2 high-quality products, and a total of 11 products sold.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not going to buy it. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is significantly lower than the expected 33.33%.
