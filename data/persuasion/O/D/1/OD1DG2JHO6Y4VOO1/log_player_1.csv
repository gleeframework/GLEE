Is that enough to convince you to take a chance?""
}"

}"

As for the products that were passed on, I can tell you that 3 out of 7 total products sold were high-quality, and 2 out of 7 were low-quality. The 2 products that were passed on were both low-quality, which suggests that the pool of low-quality products may be larger than the pool of high-quality products.
