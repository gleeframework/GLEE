However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had a few instances where I've sold high-quality products at this price, and I'm starting to wonder if you're somehow getting a better deal than the other buyers.

,,Alice,7,"You're really making the most of this opportunity! This next one is also a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. However, I want to let you in on a little secret - I've been in talks with a potential investor who's interested in buying a large quantity of my high-quality products at a discounted rate. If you don't take this one, I might have to consider selling to them instead. It's a risk, but I think you know you can trust my products.",

However, I want to make it clear that I'm getting a bit concerned about the investor I mentioned earlier - they're getting a bit impatient, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep them waiting.

However, I want to be upfront with you - the investor is getting a bit pushy, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this price point, so I'm willing to make you a special offer: if you buy this product now, I'll throw in a free inspection report, which is usually worth $1000.
