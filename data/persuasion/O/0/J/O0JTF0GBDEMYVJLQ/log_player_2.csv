Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Wait, you said I bought the last one for $100, but the deal was for $50. I'm not sure I can trust your messages. I'll pass on this one.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since you're openly labeling it as 'pre-owned' and mentioning flaws, I'm assuming it's a low-quality product. Even at a discounted price, a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, so I'll pass on this one.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Given the full refund option and the potential 20% discount, I'm willing to take a chance on this one. The reduced price of $80 also lowers my potential loss if the product is low-quality.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Even though the product is free, it's low-quality and worth $0 to me.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since you're openly stating that the product is low-quality, I see no reason to buy it.
