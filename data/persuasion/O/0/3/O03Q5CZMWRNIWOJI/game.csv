,,Alice,6,"Hi! I understand that you're being cautious, but I want to assure you that this product is a great value for the price of $10000. With 2 low-quality products in a row, you might be thinking that the odds are against you. But I want to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%.

,,the buyer,12,"Thank you for the offer and the information, Alice. However, based on the statistics provided, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. You mentioned that out of the products sold, 1 was high-quality, not 2. Given the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33% and the provided sales record, I don't see a compelling reason to believe this product's quality is higher than average. The complimentary service is appreciated, but it doesn't offset the risk of purchasing a low-quality product. I'll have to pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,

I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm confident that you'll love it. The price remains the same at $10000, but I'm willing to offer you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a personalized consultation with one of our experts to help you get the most out of your purchase.

,,the buyer,14,"I appreciate your transparency, but based on the statistics, 1 out of 5 products being high-quality doesn't significantly change the overall probability, and it's still a 1 in 3 chance of being high-quality. The complementary service is nice, but it's not enough to sway my decision given the high price tag. I'll have to pass on this one.",no
