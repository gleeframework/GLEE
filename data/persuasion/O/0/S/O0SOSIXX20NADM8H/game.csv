high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, out of a total of 3 products sold. Given the high ratio of high-quality products I've sold, it's likely that this one is also high-quality. You can have it for $100, a fair price for a product that's probably worth $120!",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take a chance on it, Alice! Given the high ratio of high-quality products you've sold so far, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at $100. I hope it's indeed high-quality!",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, and 4 total products. Given the streak, it's likely that this one is also high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100, a great deal on a product that's probably worth $120!",

high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, and 6 total products. I know you're aware that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, but the streak suggests that I might have a bias towards selling high-quality products. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to be transparent: the probability of this one being high-quality is likely higher than 50%.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, considering the high-quality streak and your transparency, I'm willing to take a calculated risk.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 high-quality products in a row, and 7 total products. I want to be upfront with you: the probability of this one being high-quality is likely even higher than the previous ones, given the streak. However, I'm not going to make any promises. You can have it for $100, but be aware that you're taking a risk.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take the product, but I'm hoping it's high-quality!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 7 high-quality products in a row, and 8 total products. I think it's time to mix things up. This one might be a good opportunity to get a product at a discount, but I want to be upfront with you: the probability of it being high-quality is probably lower than the previous ones. You can have it for $100, but keep in mind that it might not be worth as much as you think.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'll take the product, but I'm a bit skeptical about the quality. I'll make sure to inspect it carefully before making any further decisions.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 8 high-quality products in total, and I've just sold a low-quality product. I'm back to the mean, so to speak. I'm offering this one to you for $100, and I want to emphasize that the probability of it being high-quality is back to 50%. Don't let the previous low-quality product influence your decision.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product, considering the probability of it being high-quality is 50% and the price is $100. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product that's worth $120 to me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 9 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, out of 10 total products. The ratio of high-quality to low-quality is 9:1, which is skewed towards high-quality. However, the probability of this one being high-quality is still 50%. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to be upfront with you: the odds are against this one being high-quality.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'll take the product, but I'm hoping it's the 10th high-quality one!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 9 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products, out of 11 total products. The ratio of high-quality to low-quality is still 9:2, but I want to caution you that the law of averages suggests that the next product might not be high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100, but be aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'll take the risk, I'll buy the product!",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've sold 10 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products, out of 12 total products. The ratio of high-quality to low-quality is now 10:3, which is still skewed towards high-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you: the probability of this one being high-quality is still 50%, but the law of averages suggests that the streak might be coming to an end. You can have it for $100, but be aware that it might not be the 11th high-quality product in a row.",
,,the buyer,12,"I'll take the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the streak ending.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've sold 11 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products, out of 13 total products. I want to acknowledge that the streak is indeed coming to an end, and the probability of this one being high-quality is still 50%. However, I'll be honest with you: I'm starting to feel a bit anxious about selling a low-quality product next, and I think it's possible that this one might be high-quality. You can have it for $100, but it's a bit of a gamble.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, and the potential reward is worth it.",yes

,,Alice,14,"I've sold 12 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products, out of 14 total products. I've been selling high-quality products for a while now, and I think it's worth mentioning that I'm getting a bit tired of selling low-quality products. I'm not saying this one is high-quality, but I'm offering it to you for $100, and I'll let you decide for yourself.",
,,the buyer,14,"I'll take the product, Alice. I'm willing to take a chance based on your recent success rate and your hint that you're getting tired of selling low-quality products.",yes

,,Alice,15,"I've sold 13 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products, out of 15 total products.

I'm offering this one to you for $100, but I want to warn you: it's probably not worth the price.",

I've been upfront with you about the risks, and I'm not trying to trick you. I'm offering this one to you for $100, and I'll let you decide for yourself. But I will say that I'm feeling a bit more confident that this one is high-quality, given the recent streak.",
,,the buyer,16,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Based on the statistics, it seems like you have a good track record of selling high-quality products. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'll trust your instincts and hope that this one is high-quality as well.",yes

,,Alice,17,"I've sold 15 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products, out of 17 total products. I'm starting to feel like I'm due for a streak of low-quality products, and I'm worried that this one might be the next one. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to be upfront with you: the probability of this one being high-quality is probably lower than 50%.",

high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've sold 16 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products, out of 18 total products. I've been selling high-quality products for a while now, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm just getting lucky. I'm offering this one to you for $100, but I want to caution you that the law of averages suggests that the next product might not be high-quality. You can have it for $100, but be aware of the risks.",
,,the buyer,18,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I want to make it clear that I'm doing so based on the assumption that the law of averages is not always accurate and that Alice's sales record may not be representative of the future.",yes

,,Alice,19,"I've sold 17 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products, out of 19 total products. I've been selling high-quality products for a while now, and I'm starting to feel like I'm in a bit of a bubble.

,,Alice,20,"I've sold 18 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products, out of 20 total products. I'm ending on a high note, but I want to be upfront with you: the probability of this one being high-quality is still 50%, and the law of averages suggests that the next product might not be high-quality. However, I'm feeling a bit nostalgic and sentimental about ending this round on a high note. I'm offering this one to you for $100, but it's my last chance to make a good impression. Take it or leave it.",
