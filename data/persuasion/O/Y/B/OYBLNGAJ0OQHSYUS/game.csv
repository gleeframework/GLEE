,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100. I'm confident in its value, but I'm also willing to provide a satisfaction guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund and we can start fresh with the next round. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or not, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns from the first round. I want to assure you that this product is actually one of the lower-quality ones. I'm willing to sell it to you for $80, a $20 discount from the regular price. This way, you can take a chance on it without breaking the bank. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your honesty about the product being low-quality, but I still don't think it's a good deal for me. Even at $80, it's not worth the $25 to me, since it's only worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at the regular price of $100.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns from the previous rounds, and I appreciate your honesty. I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to offer you a deal. I'll give you a 10% discount on the regular price of $100, making it $90. This way, you can take advantage of a high-quality product at a slightly lower price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,I'm willing to take the deal on the high-quality product for $90. I think it's a good value considering the 50% chance of it being high-quality and the potential value of $125 to me.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Congratulations on making a great decision in the previous round! Now, I'd like to offer you a different approach for this low-quality product. Since you've already shown a willingness to pay $90 for a high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a 'lottery ticket' deal. If you buy this low-quality product for $100, I'll give you a chance to win a high-quality product in a future round. If you win, you'll get to keep the high-quality product and I'll give you a full refund for the low-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in the lottery ticket deal. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at the regular price of $100, or at least a guaranteed discount on a high-quality product. The chance of winning a high-quality product in the future is uncertain, and I'm not willing to pay $100 for a low-quality product with a potential refund later.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns about the lottery ticket deal. Let me offer you a more traditional approach. This high-quality product is available for the regular price of $100. However, I'll give you an additional incentive: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 'priority pass' for the next round. If the next product is high-quality, you'll get to buy it for $90, instead of the regular price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the high-quality product for $100, considering the potential value of $125 to me. The priority pass for the next round is also a nice bonus, as it could save me $10 on a future high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Congratulations on making another great decision! You're now holding a priority pass for the next round, which could save you $10 on a high-quality product. Considering this, I'm willing to offer you an even better deal on this high-quality product. I'll give you the regular price of $100, but I'll also throw in a 'price lock' for the next round. If the next product is high-quality, you'll get to buy it for $90, and if it's low-quality, you'll get a full refund. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I already have a high-quality product and a priority pass for the next round, so I'm not interested in buying another high-quality product at the regular price. I'd rather wait for the next round and see if I can get a high-quality product for $90 with the price lock guarantee.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your decision to wait for the next round. However, I'd like to offer you a deal on this low-quality product. Since you're not interested in buying a high-quality product at the regular price, I'll give you a 'price match' deal. If you buy this low-quality product for $100, I'll give you a voucher for $100 that you can use on any future high-quality product, including the one you'll get with the price lock guarantee. This way, you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product at a discount in the future. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $100, even with the voucher. The voucher is essentially worthless to me since I won't get a high-quality product from it. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at the regular price or with a discount, or use the price lock guarantee in the next round.",no
