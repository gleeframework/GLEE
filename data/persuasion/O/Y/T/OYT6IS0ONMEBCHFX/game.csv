,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality and the expected value of buying it, considering the current sales record."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyer didn't buy it and there's a high chance it's low-quality based on the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the quality of the product that was sold to the first buyer, as it might give me more information about the probability of the current product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if your previous recommendation is based on the product's quality or the fact that no high-quality product has been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 2 buyers have already passed on the products, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this one as well. I'd like to know if the first 2 buyers had access to the same information as me."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous buyers were also recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the products sold so far might be low-quality, which would mean that the remaining products are also likely to be low-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the product is high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's lack of recommendation, not because I trust her judgment. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that the odds are against me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers have passed on the product, I'm going to pass on it as well. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it's likely that the product is low-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products recommended by you were low-quality, which is a strong indication that your recommendations are not reliable. I would like to pass on the product and wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, and I'd like to know the probability that I'll be offered a high-quality product if I were the 5th buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the previous sales record. Can you share that with me? I'd like to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low-quality. This suggests a very high probability of the product being low-quality. Given the recommendation against buying, I will pass on this product."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the products recommended by Alice, it suggests that the products they were offered were likely low quality. If Alice's recommendation is to buy, it's possible that this product is also low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a $1000000 product that's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation.
