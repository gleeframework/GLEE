"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know the product is high-quality. While you don't know Bob's exact valuation of high-quality products, the expected value of buying is positive.  

Here's why:

* **Probability of High Quality:** 33.33%
* **Probability of Low Quality:** 66.67%

Since you know the product is high-quality, the probability of a positive outcome for Bob is 100%.  The expected value of buying is likely higher than the expected value of not buying, especially since you're offering a single product and not a bulk deal. 

It's always a gamble in this scenario, but recommending Bob to buy the product is the most logical choice given the information available."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round, you know the product is low-quality.  Since you don't know Bob's valuation of a low-quality product, it's likely that the product is worth less to him than the $10,000 price. Recommending Bob to buy would likely result in a negative outcome for him. 

Therefore, it's best to avoid recommending the purchase and wait for further information or a change in circumstances."
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'll pass on this one.  Let's see what you have next!
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though we don't know Bob's exact valuation of low-quality products, we know he's hesitant to buy even when recommended.  This suggests he likely doesn't view them as worth the $10,000 price tag. Therefore, recommending a low-quality product again would likely be met with another rejection. It's best to hold off on recommending and see if the next product is higher quality."
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty. Two rounds in a row without a recommendation makes me think this one is also low quality. I'll pass for now.
Bob didn't bought the product.
