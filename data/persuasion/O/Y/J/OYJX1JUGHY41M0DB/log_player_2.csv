**Reasoning:**

* **No prior information:** There's no data on the seller's track record, so we have to rely on the odds.
* **Positive recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which suggests she might have some insight (though we don't know how reliable it is).
* **Potential upside:**  The product has a chance of being high quality, which would be a significant gain.
* **Limited downside:**  Even if it's low quality, the loss is only $100, which is manageable.

This is a gamble, but the potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information. We know only one product has been sold, and it was high quality. This could be purely luck, or it could indicate Alice has some ability to discern quality.
* **Potential Gain:** The potential gain ($400) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($0). 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Given the lack of information, it's a gamble, but a calculated one. The potential reward is high enough to justify the risk."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Purchase Rate:** Two out of two buyers have purchased the products, indicating a high probability of a good product.
* **High-Quality Product Sales:** The fact that two high-quality products have been sold so far strongly suggests Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the purchase further reinforces the positive signals.

While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product (66.67%), the evidence presented strongly suggests the product is likely high-quality. The potential reward of $400 outweighs the risk of $0."
