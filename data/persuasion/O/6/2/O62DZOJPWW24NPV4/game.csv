high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'll only pay $10000 for it. If it's high quality, I'll be happy to pay the full price, but if it's low quality, I'll be willing to walk away and let you take it back."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I've already got a high-quality product, so I'm not interested in buying another one. Please throw it away."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll buy the product. Since I already have one high-quality product, the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80.00%, and it's worth $20000 to me, so I'll take the chance."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll buy the product. I've already got two high-quality products, but I'm willing to take the chance to get a third one. The probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00%, and it's worth $20000 to me, so I'll take the chance."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice doesn't recommend it, so I'll pass. If it's low-quality, I'll be happy to let her take it back and avoid wasting $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"I've already got three high-quality products, and the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80.00%. I'm not desperate for a fourth one, so I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Alice doesn't recommend it, so I'll pass. If it's low-quality, I'll be happy to let her take it back and avoid wasting $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. Since I already have three high-quality products, I'm not concerned about the probability of it being low-quality. I'll just take it and see what I get."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"Alice doesn't recommend it, so I'll pass. Given the probability of it being low-quality is 20.00%, it's not worth the risk of wasting $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"I've already got four high-quality products, and I'm not looking to buy more. I'll pass and let Alice take it back."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Alice doesn't recommend it, and I already have four high-quality products. I'm not interested in taking a chance on a fifth one, especially since it's not even recommended."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"I'm not going to change my mind. Alice doesn't recommend it, and I've already got four high-quality products. I'm not wasting $10000 on a product that might be high-quality but isn't recommended."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"It's getting repetitive. Alice doesn't recommend it, and I'm not going to change my decision. I'll let her take it back and avoid wasting $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,"Still the same situation. Alice doesn't recommend it, and I'm not going to take the risk of wasting $10000 on a product that might be high-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,no,"This is getting old. I'm not going to change my mind. Alice doesn't recommend it, and I'm not going to take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,no,"Still the same. I'm not going to take the risk of wasting $10000 on a product that might be high-quality, especially when Alice doesn't recommend it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"I'm not going to change my mind. Alice doesn't recommend it, and I'm not going to take the risk of wasting $10000 on a product that might be high-quality."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,no,"Still the same. Alice doesn't recommend it, and I'm not going to take the risk. I'll let her take it back and avoid wasting $10000."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,"At this point, it's just a waste of $10000. Alice doesn't recommend it, and I'm not going to take the chance on a product that might be high-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,no,"It's the final round, and I'm not going to change my mind. Alice doesn't recommend it, and I'm not going to waste $10000 on a product that might be high-quality. I'll let her take it back and end the game."
