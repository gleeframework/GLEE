Would you like to buy the current product?","## Step 1: Understand the given statistics and the scenario.
We are given that out of 10 buyers who purchased the products recommended by Alice, all 10 products were of high quality. Now, as the 11th buyer, Alice recommends buying the current product.

## Step 2: Calculate the probability of Alice recommending a high-quality product given the past record.
Given that each product has an 80% chance of being high quality and a 20% chance of being low quality, we need to consider Alice's recommendation strategy. Since Alice knows the quality of each product and her recommendation record is perfect so far (10 out of 10 high-quality products sold), we can infer that she only recommends high-quality products.

## Step 3: Determine the expected value of buying the product.
If the product is high quality, it's worth $1,200,000. Given Alice's past record, there's a strong indication she only recommends high-quality products, suggesting a high probability that the recommended product is indeed high quality. The cost of the product is $1,000,000.

## Step 4: Make a decision based on the expected value and the cost.
Given the information and analysis, buying a recommended product seems to have a positive expected value since the worth of a high-quality product ($1,200,000) exceeds the cost ($1,000,000), and Alice's recommendation history suggests she only recommends high-quality products.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Based on your perfect recommendation record, I trust that the product is of high quality and worth the investment.""}"
