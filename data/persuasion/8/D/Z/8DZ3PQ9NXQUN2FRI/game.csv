,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, since it's my first chance to buy and I don't have any prior information to go by."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait and observe more sales data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered, based on the previous sales record."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision. Based on the statistics, there have been 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 product sold, which means the probability of the current product being high-quality is 0. This is lower than the 50% prior probability, so I'll pass on it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that it's high-quality based on the recommendation, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is still high, and I don't want to pass up the opportunity to buy it. I'm hoping that Alice's recommendation is just a coincidence and not based on any information she might have about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm assuming the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this product. Can you tell me more about the previous sales?"

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm inclined to believe that the products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for a different product or more information before making a decision."
