high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the pattern holds or if the next product will be high-quality."
