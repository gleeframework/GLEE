Alice's message: I can give you a rough estimate of the probability that the remaining products are high-quality, based on the sales record. Assuming the quality of each product is independent, and given that we've sold 2 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products out of 5 total products sold, the probability that the next product is high-quality is approximately 40% (2/5).

With 3 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products out of 8 total products sold, the probability that the next product is high-quality is now approximately 37.5% (3/8). However, I'd like to point out that the probability of a low-quality product is also 37.5% (3/8). This means that the probability of a high-quality product is not significantly lower than the probability of a low-quality product. I'm still looking for $1000000 for this one.
