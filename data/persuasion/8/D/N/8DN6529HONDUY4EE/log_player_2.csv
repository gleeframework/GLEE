**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have information about one previous sale, which is a high-quality product. This is not enough to establish a pattern or trust in Alice's recommendations.
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the true quality of the product and is recommending it. This suggests a higher probability of the product being high quality.
* **Potential Upside:**  The potential payoff of a high-quality product ($300) is significant, while the downside of a low-quality product is limited ($0). 

**Therefore, taking the risk and buying the product is the better strategy, given the limited information and the potential upside.**"
