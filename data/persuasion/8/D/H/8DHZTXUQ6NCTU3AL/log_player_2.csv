**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  We only have data from one previous buyer.  This is too small a sample size to draw meaningful conclusions about Alice's ability to predict product quality. 
* **Alice's Incentive:**  Alice wants to sell the products.  Her recommendation is likely to be biased towards making a sale.
* **Potential Upside:** Even with the high probability of a low-quality product, the potential payoff of a high-quality product ($1,200,000) is significant.  The risk is worth taking given the potential reward.

**This is a gamble, but it's a calculated one based on the information available.**"
