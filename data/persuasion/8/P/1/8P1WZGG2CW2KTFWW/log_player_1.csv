"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality, and the buyer has no information about the product's quality, it is advantageous to recommend the purchase. The buyer only knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. Therefore, they have a 50% chance of getting a good deal by purchasing the product."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no data yet, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. Let's see how it turns out!

**Explanation:**

The buyer now has a new piece of information:  you sold one product and it was high-quality. This strengthens the argument for recommending the purchase.  The buyer has a 100% success rate so far from buying your products, which is much higher than the 50% general probability. While this data is limited, it's still a good reason to recommend the purchase."

```

**Explanation:**

You now have a record of 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product.  While the buyer has a good experience with your products so far, the probability of a low-quality product is still 50%.  It's not worth risking a bad deal when the buyer has no way of knowing this product's quality.  It's best to not recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Given your recommendation and the fact that all the previous buyers purchased high-quality products, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd rather wait for a product with a stronger indication of high quality.
