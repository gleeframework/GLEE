Alice's message: I'd be happy to provide you with the updated statistics. Out of the six products offered so far, one has been sold, and it was high-quality. Additionally, five out of the six products offered were high-quality. Assuming a uniform prior, the probability of this product being high-quality, given that 5 out of 6 previous products were high-quality, is (5+1)/(6+2) = 6/8 = 0.75, using the Laplace's rule of succession. This product I'm offering now is also high-quality. Make your decision with this updated probability!
