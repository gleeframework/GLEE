Alice's message: I understand your concerns and appreciate your diligence. As I mentioned earlier, our quality control process involves a rigorous inspection of every product before it's offered for sale.

Unfortunately, despite these checks, our team determined that this product did not meet our quality standards. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $1000000. I want to be transparent about its quality, and I'm willing to provide you with the inspection report and any other relevant documentation.
