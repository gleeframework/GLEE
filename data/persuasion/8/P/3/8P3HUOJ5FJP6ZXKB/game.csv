,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since I don't have any information about its quality yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the lack of sales data.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the current statistics."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision-making process, was it based on the recommendation or not?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to decline the product based on the recommendation. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's possible that the products being sold are all low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it? And can I see the statistics again?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product after your recommendation, I'm starting to suspect that the products Alice has been recommending are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, none of the previous two products were high-quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't change my assessment of the product's quality. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products, given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality, so I'm inclined to think that the product is low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of the product's quality, which is not available to me. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 other buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a product based solely on Alice's recommendation without considering the statistics. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were not high quality, the probability of the current product being high quality is still 50%, but the probability of it being low quality is also 50%. I'd rather wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products, I suspect that the product quality distribution might be biased towards low-quality products, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/2, which is 0%. This is lower than my expected 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, I think it's likely that the product is low quality, and I don't want to waste $1000000 on it."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm suspicious that the products Alice has been offering are all low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
