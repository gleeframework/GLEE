"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 
Since this is the first round, the buyer has no information about your selling record. They only know the general probability of a product being high-quality is 80%.  Therefore, it's in your best interest to recommend the buyer to purchase the product, as there's a high chance they'll value the high-quality product at more than $100."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first product, and there's no historical data, I'm willing to take the risk based on your recommendation. Let's buy it!
The buyer bought the product!

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

In this round, you know the product is low-quality. While the buyer doesn't know this, they now have some information about your selling record: you've sold one product, and it was high-quality.  This will increase their expectations of the product being high-quality.  Therefore, it's unlikely they will value the low-quality product at $100. It's better to not recommend the product and risk losing this round, rather than risk damaging your reputation and future sales by selling a low-quality product."

* **Your Perspective:** You know this product is high-quality.  Even with the potential for buyer skepticism, the chance of them valuing this high-quality product above $100 is still high.

It's a gamble, but recommending the purchase keeps your sales rolling and potentially helps you build trust for future rounds."

* **Your Perspective:** You know this product is high-quality.  With the buyer's increased trust in your products, this is a good opportunity for a sale.
