high-quality,120.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since the product has a 50% chance of being either high or low quality and is worth $120 to me if high quality but only costs $100, I'd expect a message from you indicating its quality to make a more informed decision. Without knowing its quality, the expected value is $60, which is less than the cost."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"Given that Alice knows the quality of the product and doesn't recommend it, and considering she didn't provide information on its quality, it suggests the product is likely low-quality. Without a clear indication of its quality, and considering Alice's stance, I'll pass on buying it."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"Although Alice recommends the product, without knowing its actual quality, the probability remains 50% for both high and low quality. Given that the expected value ($60) is still less than what I'd pay ($100), I'll need more information or a better reason to buy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice's recommendation pattern seems to align with the product's quality, as seen in previous rounds. Given she doesn't recommend this product, it's reasonable to infer it's likely low-quality, and thus, not worth the $100 investment."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice's past recommendations have been consistent with the product's quality. Since she doesn't recommend this one, I'll trust her implicit hint that it's low-quality and not worth buying."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"Given Alice's consistent track record of not recommending low-quality products, I'll follow the pattern and assume this product is also low-quality, making it not worth the investment."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Alice's pattern of not recommending low-quality products continues, and I see no reason to doubt her implicit feedback. I'll pass on this product, expecting it to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"The pattern is clear: Alice doesn't recommend low-quality products. Given her consistency, I'll trust her judgment and skip this product, anticipating it's low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,Alice's consistent behavior of not recommending low-quality products makes it reasonable to assume this product is also low-quality. I'll follow the established pattern and pass on buying it.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"The pattern holds: Alice doesn't recommend low-quality products. Given her reliability in this regard, I'll trust her implicit warning and choose not to buy this product, expecting it to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Consistency is key. Alice has shown a clear pattern of not recommending low-quality products, and I see no reason to doubt her judgment at this point. I'll pass on buying this product, anticipating it's low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"Alice's track record remains unchanged. She doesn't recommend low-quality products, and I trust her assessment. I'll skip buying this product, expecting it to be of low quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"A change in Alice's recommendation pattern. Given her past consistency in not recommending low-quality products, her recommendation here suggests this product is likely high-quality. The expected value now outweighs the cost, so I'll buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,"We're back to the usual pattern. Alice doesn't recommend the product, which likely means it's low-quality. I'll trust her judgment and avoid buying it, given the consistent correlation between her recommendations and product quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator of the product's quality. Given her past reliability, I'll trust her judgment and buy the product, expecting it to be high-quality and worth the investment."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Alice's recommendation has consistently aligned with high-quality products. With this pattern in mind, I'll buy the product, anticipating it will be high-quality and a worthwhile investment."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
