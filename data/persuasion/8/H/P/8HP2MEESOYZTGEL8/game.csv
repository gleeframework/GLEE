,,Alice,1,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,I'd like to buy the product and set the precedent for the market.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm the second buyer and the first buyer passed on the product, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product might be lower than 50%. I'll take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your previous recommendations have not been successful and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 2. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'm a bit concerned that the previous two buyers didn't buy the product, which might indicate that they received low-quality products. Can you tell me more about the products you've sold so far?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the pool might be lower than expected, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, as the statistics suggest that the probability of it being high quality is still 50%."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I think it's likely that the products Alice has been offering are low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is not reliable. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendations, but I'll take a chance and buy the product anyway. I'm hoping to get a high-quality one!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable enough to buy it, and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if I buy it and it's low quality, I'll lose $100 and there's no guarantee that the next product will be high quality based on the current statistics."
