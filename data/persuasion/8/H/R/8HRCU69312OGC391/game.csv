,,Alice,1,no,

,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm trying to gather more data and see if the product is high quality or low quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that there have been no high-quality products sold yet, so she might be trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'd rather wait and see what happens with the next product."

,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 previous sales, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous 3 products were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
