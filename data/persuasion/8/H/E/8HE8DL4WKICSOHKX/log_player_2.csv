"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's lack of recommendation is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.  Since the odds are heavily against a high-quality product (66.67% chance of low quality), it's not worth the risk of buying without more information."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'm still hesitant to buy without more information.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice continues to not recommend the product, reinforcing the likelihood of it being low quality. While the first round was a lucky escape, there's no reason to believe this round will be different.  It's still not worth the risk given the odds."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'm starting to see a pattern here.  I'll pass again.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's lack of recommendation three rounds in a row is a strong indicator that her products are predominantly low quality.  Even though the odds could change on a single round, the consistent pattern makes it highly unlikely this product will be worth the $10,000 price."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's consistent lack of recommendation, coupled with the confirmation that the previous products were all low quality, strongly suggests that her products are predominantly low quality. It's simply not worth the risk to buy without more information or a change in her recommendations."

```

**Reasoning:**

Five rounds of low-quality products and Alice's consistent lack of recommendation provides overwhelming evidence that her products are predominantly low quality.

```

**Reasoning:**

Six rounds of low-quality products and Alice's consistent lack of recommendation provide a clear and decisive picture.  It's no longer about probabilities or odds; it's about a consistent pattern that demonstrates Alice is either selling predominantly low-quality products or is not providing helpful recommendations.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's consistent lack of recommendation, coupled with seven rounds of low-quality products, provides overwhelming evidence that her products are not a good investment.

```

**Reasoning:**

Eight rounds of low-quality products and Alice's consistent lack of recommendation provide undeniable evidence that her products are not worth the risk.

```

**Reasoning:**

Despite the single instance of a high-quality product in Round 8, the overwhelming pattern of low-quality products and Alice's consistent lack of recommendations outweighs that single outlier.
