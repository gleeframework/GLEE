"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know the product is high-quality.  Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and a high-quality product is worth $125 to them, they would be getting a significant value for their money.  Even though they don't know the specific quality of this product, the expected value of the purchase is positive:

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.3333 * $125) + (0.6667 * $0)**
* **Expected Value = $41.66** 

Since the expected value is positive, it makes sense for the buyer to purchase the product, even without knowing its specific quality."
