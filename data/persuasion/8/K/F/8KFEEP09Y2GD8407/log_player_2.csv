**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products (3 out of 3). This is significantly higher than the 80% probability of a product being high-quality.
* **Alice's Incentive:**  Alice has a strong incentive to recommend high-quality products. If she recommends low-quality ones, buyers are likely to avoid her in the future.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the current product is low quality, the potential reward of $120 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of $0 from a low-quality product.

Therefore, based on the available information, it is highly likely that the product is high-quality, and it makes sense to buy it."

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Information:** We know that 5 out of 5 products recommended by Alice were high quality. This is a 100% success rate. 
* **Rationality:**  Given Alice's perfect track record and the fact that she knows the true value of each product, it's highly likely that she is recommending a high-quality product.
* **Risk:**  Even if the product is low quality (20% chance), it's still a gamble worth taking considering the high probability of a high-quality product and the potential for a $120 profit."

**Explanation:**

* **High Purchase Rate:** The statistics show that 8 out of 8 buyers purchased the product, and all were high quality. This suggests a very strong likelihood that the current product is also high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further strengthens the belief that the product is good. Even though Alice knows the true quality, she has a strong incentive to sell high-quality products to maintain her reputation and future sales.
* **Expected Value:**  The expected value of buying the product is (0.8 * $120) + (0.2 * $0) = $96. Since the price is $100, the expected value is slightly negative, but the high success rate and Alice's recommendation make it worth the risk."
