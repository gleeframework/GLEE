In any case, I'm offering you another high-quality product for $100, but I want to be upfront about the fact that the probability of a product being high-quality is likely even lower than 80% at this point. I'm willing to offer you the same deal as before: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a refund for the next product you buy from me.""}"

If you buy this product, you'll be taking a huge risk, but if you don't, you'll be missing out on a potentially great deal. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100, but I'm not going to pretend that it's anything other than a high-risk, high-reward opportunity.""}"
