**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The statistics show that 100% of the products recommended by Alice so far have been high quality. This strongly suggests that Alice has a reliable way of identifying high-quality products.
* **Potential Gain:** Even with the 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain of $12,000 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 

**It's important to note:** This is a simplified scenario. In a real-world situation, there would be more factors to consider, such as the cost of potential future replacements if the product is low quality, and the buyer's overall risk tolerance."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 6 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 6 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 7th buyer!

**Explanation:**

Based on the available information:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is recommending the purchase, which is a positive signal.
* **Sales record:** All 6 previous buyers who purchased the product received a high-quality item. This suggests a very high probability of the current product also being high quality.

Given the potential payoff of $12,000 for a high-quality product and the risk of only losing $10,000 for a low-quality product, the odds heavily favor buying."

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** The statistics show a very high success rate (12/13 = 92.3%) of high-quality products being sold. This strongly suggests Alice has a good understanding of the products and is likely making accurate recommendations.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further supports the likelihood of the product being high quality.
* **Value Proposition:** Even with a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of $12,000 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $10,000 for a low-quality product, considering the high success rate.

Therefore, it's a calculated risk worth taking based on the available information."
