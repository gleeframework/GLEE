high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. Since 3 buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems like the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, and based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and rejected the product, which suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products being sold. I'd like to pass on this one for now."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite the recommendation, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the sales record or just a random decision?"

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the products Alice is offering are more likely to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, it seems that Alice's recommendations are likely to be accurate.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 6 out of 6 buyers passed on the product, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is very low. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to potentially get a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know why you're recommending against it. Is there a pattern or a reason behind your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 7 previous buyers, none of them purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you'll reveal its quality after my decision. I'd like to make an informed decision based on the probability of it being high-quality, considering the previous sales record."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 previous buyers did not buy the product, and none of the products sold were high quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high quality is very low. Given the odds, I'm going to pass on this product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a $0 product."
