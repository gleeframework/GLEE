"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not convinced.  While a discount is tempting,  I need more than just your word and the fact that it's a 'rare find'.  Can you provide me with any documentation or evidence from these 'industry experts' about the product's quality and performance?   I'm still not willing to take a risk without more concrete proof.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Would you like to take advantage of this limited-time offer?""}"
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not interested in any more 'insider' deals or special offers. I'm still learning about your products, and I'm hesitant to jump into another purchase without more information. I'd like to see some evidence of the quality of your products before making any further decisions. Perhaps you can share some details about the products you've sold in the past, or testimonials from other satisfied customers.  Let me know if you're willing to provide that information.

I can also provide you with a list of 5 satisfied customers who are willing to vouch for the quality of our products. Would you like to hear from them directly?""}"
"Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the gesture, the information you've provided isn't quite convincing enough for me to make a purchase.  A 75% satisfaction rate doesn't tell me much about the actual quality of the products, especially since I'm not sure how many customers that represents.   I'd feel more confident if you could provide more specific details about the products those customers purchased, such as their quality levels or specific features.  Also, while hearing from 5 satisfied customers is interesting, it wouldn't be a replacement for independent verification or reviews.  Are you willing to share any of that information with me?

Would you like to review this information and see if it addresses your concerns?""}"
"Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the additional details, I'm still not ready to buy.  Providing me with a list of past products doesn't necessarily guarantee that the current product I'm considering is also high quality.  I'm still looking for independent evidence or verification of the product's quality.  Perhaps you could offer a trial period or a money-back guarantee to demonstrate your confidence in the product's worth.  Let me know if you're open to that.
