**Reasoning:**

* **High probability of good product:**  The statistics show that the only product sold so far was high-quality. While this is a small sample size, it suggests that Alice's recommendation process might be effective in identifying good products. 
* **Potential value:** If the product is high-quality, you stand to make a $20 profit ($120 value to you - $100 price). 
* **Risk is limited:** If it's low-quality, you lose $100, but you have a decent chance of getting a good product.

**This is a gamble, but the potential reward outweighs the risk in this specific scenario.**"

~
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive recommendation:** Alice recommends the product, which suggests she believes it's high quality. 
* **Good track record:** The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products sold.
* **High potential value:** Even if it's a low-quality product, it costs only $100, and a high-quality product is worth $120. 

This situation represents a positive risk-reward scenario. The potential upside (high-quality product) outweighs the potential downside (low-quality product)."
