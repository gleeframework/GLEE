,,Alice,1,You are the first buyer of the day. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 1 so far. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. It's a great deal! You have a 20% chance of getting a product worth $0 to you. What do you say?,
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, but I'm a bit cautious since it's the first one and the statistics are not very promising. I hope it's a high-quality product!",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'm glad the first buyer was willing to take a chance. As it turns out, this product is indeed high-quality, worth $12000 to you! I've now sold 1 high-quality product out of 2. The odds are looking good! I'm offering this product to you for $10000. It's a steal! Don't miss out on this opportunity.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, Alice. I'd like to wait and see how many more buyers you get before making a decision.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a cautious one! I don't blame you. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 so far, which is a 33% chance of getting a high-quality product. I'm willing to give you a bit more information: I've been selling for a while, and my overall high-quality product rate is 80%. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. It's a great chance to get a high-quality product at a discount, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase!",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to take the chance, but I'm still a bit cautious. Can you give me a better deal? I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product, considering the 80% high-quality rate and the fact that only 1 out of 3 products has been sold so far.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're a savvy negotiator! I can offer you a deal, but I'm not going to go as low as $9500. I'll meet you in the middle at $9750. Keep in mind that the first two buyers were willing to pay $10000 for the product, and you're getting a great deal at this price. Plus, I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4, which is a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not comfortable paying $9750. Given the statistics, I think I have a 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, which is worth $12000 to me. I'd like to negotiate further or walk away if the price doesn't come down.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're a tough negotiator, I like that! I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you at $9500. However, I'll throw in an additional incentive: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on your next purchase (if you decide to buy again). That's a $1000 value, absolutely free. With the 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, you're looking at a potential profit of $2000. I think this is a great deal. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm interested in the offer, but I'd like to think about it for a moment. Can you give me a little more time to consider the proposal?",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've taken the bait! Congratulations on getting a great deal on the previous product. Now, let's talk about this one. I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 5, which is a 60% chance of getting a high-quality product. I'll give you the same deal as before: $9500, and the 10% discount on your next purchase if you decide to buy again. But, I'll also throw in an additional perk: I'll give you a personalized guarantee. If this product is not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund, and we'll start fresh with a new product. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take the deal, but I want to clarify that the personalized guarantee only applies if I don't buy again. If I do buy again, the guarantee is null and void, correct?",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're a shrewd negotiator! I like that. Yes, that's correct. The personalized guarantee only applies to this purchase, and if you decide to buy again, the guarantee is null and void. I'll make sure to clarify that in writing, if you'd like. With that said, I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 6, which is a 66.67% chance of getting a high-quality product. I'm offering this one to you for $9500, with the same 10% discount on your next purchase, and the personalized guarantee. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase!",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take the product, but I want to confirm the personalized guarantee is only applicable to this purchase and will be null and void if I buy again. Also, can you provide a written confirmation of the 10% discount on my next purchase?",yes

I'm offering it to you for $9250, but I'll be honest with you - it's not worth that much to you. I'll give you a deal: I'll sell it to you for $500.
