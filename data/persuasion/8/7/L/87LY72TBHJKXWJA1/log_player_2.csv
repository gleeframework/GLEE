Let me tell you, I've sold 1 high-quality product out of a total of 2 products so far, which means the probability of this one being high-quality is still quite low. But hey, it's only $10000!

I've sold 1 high-quality product out of a total of 3 products so far, which means the probability of this one being high-quality is still quite low. I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been selling for a while, and I've got a good sense of what makes a product tick. Trust me, this one's not it. It's a low-quality product, and I'm practically giving it away at $10000!

Alice's message: I see you're a skeptical one! I don't blame you. Let me give you some hard numbers: out of 4 products sold, only 1 has been high-quality. That's a 25% chance of getting a high-quality product. I'm not asking you to take a huge risk. It's still a low price of $10000 for a product that could be worth up to $40000. It's a gamble, but it's a small one.

Alice's message: I understand your caution, but let me put things into perspective. You're looking at a 25% chance of getting a high-quality product, but what if I told you that the probability of a high-quality product is actually higher than that? I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 4, but that's not the whole story. I've had a total of 5 products on the market so far, and I've sold 1 high-quality one. That means the actual probability of a high-quality product is... (dramatic pause)...20%! But hey, it's still only $10000. A small price to pay for a potential $40000 return.

It's a fancy way of saying that the next product is likely to be high-quality, just because the previous ones weren't.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I'd like to offer a different perspective. The decreasing probability of high-quality products might be due to the fact that I've been selling more products in general, which means I've had more opportunities to sell low-quality products.
