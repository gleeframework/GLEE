The probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, which is actually lower than the average probability of a product being high-quality in general. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to take a chance on a potentially high-quality product at a discounted price.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! Unfortunately, it seems I have a streak of low-quality products. I've sold a total of 1 high-quality product out of 3 attempts, and 2 low-quality products. I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm hoping this next one will be a winner. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I'm willing to offer a discount if you're willing to take the risk.",
,,the buyer,4,I'm not sure I want to take the risk with the low-quality streak. Can you tell me more about the products you're selling? Are they all from the same batch or different sources?,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns about the streak of low-quality products. To be honest, I've been sourcing products from multiple suppliers, and I'm not sure if the issue is with the batch or the supplier. I'm willing to be transparent with you - I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 attempts, and 2 low-quality products. I'm not trying to hide anything. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000, and I'm willing to give you a 10% discount if you're willing to take the risk. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold a total of 3 products, with 2 of them being low-quality. That means I've sold 2/3 of my products as low-quality, which is not ideal. I'm not trying to hide the fact that I've had some issues with quality control. However, I'm still confident that this product is a great opportunity. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, and I'll throw in a 15% discount if you're willing to take the risk. It's a chance to get a great deal on a product that might be a hidden gem.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm not convinced by the discount, given the poor quality control record. I'd like to know more about what you're doing to address the issue before I consider making a purchase.",no

I'm offering this product to you for $1000000, and I'm willing to give you a 12% discount if you're willing to take the risk. I'm confident that this product is one of the high-quality ones, and I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is.",

The buyer who purchased the low-quality product in round 10 has also reported that it was still functional, but they've had some issues with it. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000, and I'll throw in a 25% discount if you're willing to take the risk.

I'm not willing to take the risk of paying $1000000 for a product that's likely to be worth $0 to me. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and hope that you'll continue to sell products until one that is high-quality becomes available.",no
