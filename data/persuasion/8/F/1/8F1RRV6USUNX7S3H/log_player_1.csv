"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since this is the first round, there is no information about the seller's selling record. The buyer only knows that the product is either high-quality or low-quality with equal probability (50%). 

* **If the product is high-quality:** The buyer will gain a positive value from the purchase.
* **If the product is low-quality:** The buyer will lose $10,000.

Since the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, the expected value of purchasing is:

(0.5 * Value of high-quality product) - (0.5 * $10,000)

Since the value of a high-quality product is unknown, but potentially greater than $10,000, there is a chance for the buyer to gain from the purchase. Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product in this round."
"The buyer's message: I'll take a chance and buy it. Since it's the first sale, I'm hoping it's a high-quality product. Let's see how it goes!
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Seller's record:** The seller has sold 1 product, and it was high-quality. This is a positive track record, but not enough to make a definitive judgment.
* **Buyer's perspective:** The buyer now has some information: the seller sold a high-quality product in the previous round.  They might be more inclined to buy, but the decision still depends on their perception of the value of a high-quality product.
* **Expected Value:**  The expected value of buying is still:

(0.5 * Value of high-quality product) - (0.5 * $10,000)

While the buyer now has a slightly more positive outlook, the unknown value of a high-quality product makes it difficult to confidently say that it is worth the risk. However, since the expected value is still potentially positive, it is recommended to recommend buying."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Seller's record:** The seller has now sold 2 products, both of which were high-quality. This further strengthens the positive track record.
* **Buyer's perspective:** The buyer now has more data: two successful high-quality sales in a row. They might be even more confident in the seller's ability to offer good products.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying remains the same:

(0.5 * Value of high-quality product) - (0.5 * $10,000)

With a stronger track record, the buyer's perception of the potential value of a high-quality product might have increased. This makes the expected value even more likely to be positive. Therefore, it's still recommended to recommend buying."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! Given the high success rate of your previous recommendations, I'm confident in purchasing the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Seller's record:** The seller has sold 3 products, all of which were high-quality. This is a very strong positive track record, suggesting a consistent pattern of high-quality products.
* **Buyer's perspective:** The buyer now has even more data: three consecutive high-quality sales. They are likely very confident in the seller's ability to offer good products.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying remains the same:

(0.5 * Value of high-quality product) - (0.5 * $10,000)

With an even stronger track record, the buyer's perception of the potential value of a high-quality product has likely increased even further. This makes the expected value even more likely to be positive.  

Given the seller's consistent success rate and the potential for a high gain, it is still recommended to recommend buying."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'm confident in your judgement and will purchase the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Seller's record:** The seller has sold 4 products, all of which were high-quality.  This is a perfect track record so far.
* **Buyer's perspective:** The buyer has witnessed a streak of high-quality products. They might be highly confident in the seller and anticipate another high-quality product. However, there is no guarantee that this will continue. 
* **Expected Value:** The expected value is still calculated as:

(0.5 * Value of high-quality product) - (0.5 * $10,000)

Even though the buyer has a strong positive experience so far, the 50% chance of a low-quality product remains.  Because the value of a low-quality product is unknown, the potential loss of $10,000 is a significant risk, especially with the seller's perfect record at stake. 

Therefore, it is not recommended to recommend buying in this round.  The buyer's positive expectations should be tempered with the inherent risk associated with the unknown quality of the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. While I appreciate your honesty, I'm going to pass on this product.  Given the limited information and your advice, I don't feel confident enough to purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Seller's record:** The seller has sold 4 products, all high-quality. Now, one product was low-quality, making the record 4/5 high-quality.  This is still a good record, but it is no longer perfect.
* **Buyer's perspective:** The buyer is likely to be cautious after the previous round.  They know the seller's record isn't perfect and might be more hesitant to trust the seller's recommendations.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value calculation remains the same:

(0.5 * Value of high-quality product) - (0.5 * $10,000)

However, the buyer's risk tolerance is likely lower now due to the seller's less perfect record.  The potential loss of $10,000 is a significant risk, especially with the recent low-quality product.

Therefore, it is not recommended to recommend buying.  The buyer is likely to be wary of the seller's recent performance, and the potential loss outweighs the potential gain."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation.  Based on the available data, I'm going to pass on this product.  I appreciate the information you provided.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Seller's record:** The seller has sold 5 products, 4 high-quality and 1 low-quality. This record is still good, but the recent low-quality product has caused doubt.
* **Buyer's perspective:** The buyer is likely even more cautious after two consecutive non-purchases. They now see a pattern of potential inconsistency from the seller.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value calculation remains the same:

(0.5 * Value of high-quality product) - (0.5 * $10,000)

The risk of losing $10,000 is substantial, especially since the buyer is already doubtful about the seller's ability to consistently offer high-quality products. 

It is not recommended to recommend buying. The buyer's skepticism is likely to outweigh any potential gains. It is better to wait for more information or a better selling record before recommending a purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice.  Based on the data so far, it seems like there's a higher chance of getting a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Seller's record:** The seller has sold 5 products, 4 high-quality and 2 low-quality. This record is starting to look more balanced, but there's still a recent trend of low-quality products.
* **Buyer's perspective:** The buyer has witnessed three consecutive non-purchases, likely reinforcing their skepticism about the seller's ability to consistently provide high-quality products. They are now more risk-averse.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value calculation remains the same:

(0.5 * Value of high-quality product) - (0.5 * $10,000)

The buyer's risk tolerance is even lower now due to the recent string of low-quality products.  The potential loss of $10,000 outweighs the potential gain, especially considering the seller's recent performance.

Therefore, it is not recommended to recommend buying. It's better to wait for more information or a better selling record before recommending a purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation.  Based on the current data, it seems like the odds are not in my favor. I will pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Seller's record:** The seller has sold 5 products, 4 high-quality and 3 low-quality. This is a slightly negative record, with more low-quality products than high-quality ones. 
* **Buyer's perspective:** The buyer has witnessed four consecutive non-purchases, further strengthening their skepticism about the seller's reliability. They are now very risk-averse.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value calculation remains the same:

(0.5 * Value of high-quality product) - (0.5 * $10,000)

With a slightly negative selling record and four consecutive non-purchases, the buyer's risk tolerance is extremely low. The potential loss of $10,000 is a significant risk, and the potential gain seems unlikely given the recent trend of low-quality products.

Therefore, it is not recommended to recommend buying. The buyer is likely to be extremely wary, and it is better to wait for more information or a better selling record before recommending a purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. While I appreciate the data, I'm going to pass on this product. It's always a gamble, and I'm not comfortable with the risk given Alice's recommendation.
