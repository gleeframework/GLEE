,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have gotten a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,

,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that none of the previous three buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality.
