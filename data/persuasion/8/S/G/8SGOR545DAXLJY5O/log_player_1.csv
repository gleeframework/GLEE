"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

You have a high-quality product in the first round. Even though the buyer doesn't know this, they know that 80% of your products are high-quality.  A high-quality product is worth $2,000,000 to them, and the price is only $1,000,000.  This means they are guaranteed to make a profit of $1,000,000 if they buy the product. 

Therefore, it's a good deal for them, and you should recommend they buy it."
