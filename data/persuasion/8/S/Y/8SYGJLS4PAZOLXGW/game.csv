high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, based on the current statistics. Can you provide the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given that 1 high-quality product has been sold to the previous buyer?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product. Was it a high-quality product or a low-quality product?

,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that Alice recommends it is suspicious, given the low quality of the previous product sold."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the product is low-quality or because you think it's a low-quality product based on the statistics?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the current sales record. With only 1 high-quality product out of 2 sales, it seems the proportion of high-quality products is 50%, which is lower than the expected 80%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I get it for $100, but I'm prepared to be disappointed."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the products, and both of them turned out to be high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than the 80% chance I know about. If I buy and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll be left with a loss. I'd rather wait and see if the pattern continues or if the probability of low-quality products is actually higher than expected."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, Alice. Is it because of the previous sales record?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not sure I want to buy a product that you don't recommend, especially since the statistics show a relatively low proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not buying, but I'm curious, what's the reason behind your recommendation?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'll take a chance on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm aware that the probability of it being low-quality is still 20%."
