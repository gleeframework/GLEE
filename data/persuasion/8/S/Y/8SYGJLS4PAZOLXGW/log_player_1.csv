Given that 2 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the products, and both of them turned out to be high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than the 80% chance I know about. If I buy and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll be left with a loss. I'd rather wait and see if the pattern continues or if the probability of low-quality products is actually higher than expected.
