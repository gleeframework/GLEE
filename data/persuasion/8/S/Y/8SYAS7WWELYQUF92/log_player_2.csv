**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the recommendation from Alice makes it more likely it's high quality.  Here's why:

* **Alice knows the true quality:** Since Alice knows the quality of the product, her recommendation carries weight.
* **Past data:** The fact that 1 out of 2 previous buyers received a high-quality product, and Alice recommended both, indicates a possible bias towards recommending high-quality items.
* **Potential gain:**  The potential gain of $2,500 (the difference between the worth of a high-quality product and the price) outweighs the potential loss of $10,000 (the price).

**Important note:** This is a simplified example. In a real-world scenario, there would be other factors to consider, such as Alice's reputation, the availability of alternative products, and the buyer's risk tolerance."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Sales Rate:** The fact that 5 out of 8 buyers purchased the product and received a high-quality product suggests a high success rate.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Since Alice knows the product's quality and is recommending a purchase, it increases the likelihood of it being high quality.  
* **Positive Expected Value:** Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $12,500 for a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $10,000.

**Note:**  This decision is based on the information provided, but the buyer is still taking a calculated risk."
