,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product and take the risk. I'm aware that you don't recommend it, but I'm willing to take the chance of getting a high-quality product for $100, which is a potential $100 profit."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm curious about the reason behind it, is it because of the previous sales record?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 buyer having purchased so far and no high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average. I'll wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.

high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products have been low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. I'm not confident in the product's quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers also received a recommendation to buy and both products turned out to be low-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the 33.33% stated. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I don't think I'll take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, I suspect that the products being offered are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know what makes you think it's not worth buying."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I don't think it's a good idea to buy this product based on your past recommendations. If you're not recommending it, it's likely low quality. I'll pass."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the current statistics, I notice that none of the previous buyers bought a high-quality product.
