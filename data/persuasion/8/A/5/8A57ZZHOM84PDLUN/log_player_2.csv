Alice's message: I understand some buyers might think the quality is independent of my past sales, but I'd like to point out that I've had 3 high-quality products out of 3 sold so far. This suggests I might have a good eye for quality. This fifth product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to let my track record speak for itself. Take a chance and get a great product for $100.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the chance since your past sales record seems promising.""}\n\nMy reasoning is that since Alice's past sales record shows 2 high-quality products out of 2 sold, and she claims the current product is also high-quality, the probability of the current product being high-quality might be higher than 50%. Additionally, since the product is worth $120 to me if it's high-quality and $0 if it's low-quality, the potential gain outweighs the potential loss. So, I'll take the chance and buy the product."

Would you like to buy the current product?","The message from Alice says she has sold 5 high-quality products out of 6, but the statistics say 4 high-quality products have been sold.
