low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer, and I'll make my decision based on the probability of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, because the lack of sales suggests a high proportion of low-quality products, which increases the probability of this product being low quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 buyers have rejected the product, which suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products being offered. Given Alice's recommendation and the low probability of a high-quality product, I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, but I'm not convinced that this information is representative of the overall quality distribution. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share that with me?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as I've seen that you've recommended against all previous buyers, and none of them have bought the product. This suggests that all previous products were low-quality, and the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm skeptical about the product based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is it because you think it's low-quality based on the statistics, or is there another reason?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you don't recommend it and none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the products, it suggests that the products Alice has been offering might be of low quality. I'd like to wait for a new product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record and the lack of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm not sure about the product, but I'll take the chance since the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high and I don't want to pass up the opportunity to buy a potentially valuable product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain your reasoning?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low price of $10000 and the potential reward of $12000 if it's high quality."

,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendations. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Given that 10 out of 10 products have been low quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 11th buyer and there have been no high-quality products sold so far."
