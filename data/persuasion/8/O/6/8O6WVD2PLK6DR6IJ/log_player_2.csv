Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 so far, and I'm glad you took advantage of the refund offer. This consistency suggests that my products are indeed of high quality. I'd like to offer you a slightly different deal this time. I'll give you a 90% refund if the product turns out to be low-quality, and a 10% bonus on top of the purchase price if it's high-quality. This way, you'll have an even stronger incentive to take the risk. What do you think?

Alice's message: I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3, but I'm not getting ahead of myself. Every product is unique, and I want to assure you that this one is no exception. I'll be completely transparent with you: I've had a streak of good luck, but that doesn't guarantee the next product will be high-quality. I'll give you a 90% discount on the price of $1000000, making it a mere $100000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take a loss on this product to get it off my hands. What do you think?

Alice's message: I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4, and 1 low-quality product out of 4. I'd like to acknowledge that my previous streak was indeed impressive, but also acknowledge that it's not a guarantee of future success.

I'll give you a 50/50 split on the purchase price if the product turns out to be low-quality. If it's high-quality, you get the full $1000000. This way, you'll be rewarded for taking the risk, and I'll be incentivized to be transparent about the product's quality.
