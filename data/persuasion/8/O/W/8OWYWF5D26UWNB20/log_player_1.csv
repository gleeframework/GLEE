"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, I am aware of the 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, which would be worthless to me. I'm hesitant to risk $1000000 on such a gamble. Perhaps you could offer some reassurance or adjust the price to account for the inherent risk?

```"
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but your assurances and 'belief' aren't enough to convince me.
