Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I respect your skepticism.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Even with the potential discount on the next product, the odds are still against me.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Even with the 25% discount, I'd rather wait for a product that's been proven to be high-quality. The odds are still against me, and I don't want to risk losing $750000 on another low-quality product.""}"

I'm willing to offer you a 'package deal' - if you buy this product, I'll throw in a second, high-quality product of your choice, absolutely free. That's right, you'll get two high-quality products for the price of one. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Wait, I thought I was supposed to get a product swap for a proven high-quality product, not buy another low-quality one and then get offered a package deal.

I'll give you a 'value proposition' - if you buy this product, I'll give you a $200000 credit towards any future purchase. That's a significant discount on the next product you buy. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Even with the $200000 credit, I'd rather not risk $1000000 on a low-quality product. The credit isn't enough to offset the potential loss, and I'd rather wait for another high-quality product.""}"
