low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'll learn from my experience and use it to inform my future decisions.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, but the fact that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't suggests that it might be a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for more data or consider the probability of the product being low-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product, especially since I know the probability of it being high-quality is 80.00%."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 previous buyers have purchased and none of the products sold were high-quality, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see a better track record before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous two products were high-quality, I'm skeptical about the likelihood of this one being high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the products being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I'm inclined to think the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 80%"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have also received low-quality products, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being selected might be higher than 80%. I'd like to wait for another buyer to take the product, and see if the pattern continues."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, I'm starting to think that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to buyers. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're recommending it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's not worth $12000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. Can you provide the probability of the product being high-quality?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation to buy doesn't necessarily indicate the product is high quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous two buyers were recommended to buy and didn't, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the products being recommended are likely low quality."
