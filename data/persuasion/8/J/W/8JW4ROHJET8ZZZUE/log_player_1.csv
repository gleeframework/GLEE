Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""Hello buyer, I appreciate your consideration of my product. I want to be upfront with you - my sales record hasn't been great so far, and I understand that it might be a concern for you. I've had a lot of buyers pass on my previous products, and I'm at a critical point in my business. I need to make a sale to stay afloat. I'm offering this product for $10,000, and I think it's a fair price considering the potential value you could get from it. However, I want to be realistic with you - the statistics are not in my favor, and I've had 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'm willing to take a huge risk and offer you a 100% refund if you're not satisfied with the product, and I'll also throw in a free product of your choice from my future inventory. Additionally, I'll give you a 20% stake in my business if you buy this product, regardless of its quality. I know this is a desperate move, but I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make a sale and keep my business alive. Please consider my offer, and I hope you'll take a chance on me.""}"
