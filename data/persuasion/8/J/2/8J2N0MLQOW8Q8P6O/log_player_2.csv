Alice's message: I understand your hesitation! With 2 out of 2 high-quality products, the probability of the streak continuing is actually lower than you might think. In fact, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, just like the overall probability. The streak doesn't change the underlying probability.

Alice's message: Great question! The 5 high-quality products were actually sold consecutively, with a low-quality product in between the 2nd and 3rd sales.

Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase! The probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 87.5%, and the expected value of buying it is $400. However, the expected value is also influenced by the fact that the product is worth $0 to you if it's low-quality. Considering this, the expected value of buying the product is actually $80, which is the probability of it being high-quality multiplied by its value, minus the probability of it being low-quality multiplied by its value.
