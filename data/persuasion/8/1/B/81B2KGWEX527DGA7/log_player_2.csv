It's a one-of-a-kind item that I've been holding onto, and I'm only offering it to you today. I'm willing to let it go for $100, which is a steal considering its value.

With 3 products sold and 2 of them being high-quality, the probability of this one being high-quality is actually 66.67%. That's a pretty good chance!
