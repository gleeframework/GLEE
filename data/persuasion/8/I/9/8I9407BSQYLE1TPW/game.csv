,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. If you buy it, I'll offer you a product that is more likely to be high-quality in the next round. If you don't buy it, I'll keep offering low-quality products until you do.",

,,Alice,2,"You've decided to wait, and now you're getting another low-quality product. I'm still willing to sell this one to you for $100. Remember, you won't get a better deal if you wait, and you might get stuck with multiple low-quality products. This is your chance to get one off your hands.",

I know you're probably thinking, 'Why would I want to buy another product when I just got a good one?' Well, here's the thing: I'm not going to offer you another high-quality product anytime soon. You've already gotten one, and the probability of getting another one is still 33.33%. If you buy this one, you'll get a low-quality product for a great price, and I'll be one step closer to getting rid of it. It's a good deal for you, and I think you should take it.",

This product is also low-quality, but I'll tell you something: I've been holding onto it for a while, and it's been taking up valuable space. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, and I'll even throw in a 'bonus': if you buy it, I'll give you a hint about the next product. It's not a guarantee, but it might give you an edge in the next round. So, what do you say? Want to take a chance on this low-quality product and get a potential advantage for the next round?",

,,Alice,7,"You're really sticking to your guns, aren't you? Alright, I'll give you another chance to get a good deal. This product is also low-quality, and I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to get a little desperate to get rid of it. I'll sell it to you for $100, and I'll even give you a 'discount' of $20 off the original price. That's right, you'll get this low-quality product for $80. It's a steal, if I do say so myself.

,,Alice,9,"Ah, finally! You've been patient, and now you have another chance to get a high-quality product. I'll tell you that this one is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. But here's the thing: I've already had to offer you multiple low-quality products, and I'm starting to run out of patience. If you don't take this high-quality product, I'll have to start getting rid of the remaining low-quality products, and you might miss out on a great deal.

I know you've got the product guarantee, and I'm not going to offer you another high-quality product anytime soon. But here's the thing: I'm not going to offer you the low-quality product guarantee I made earlier. This product is still low-quality, and I'm not going to sweeten the deal.

I'll tell you that this one is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. But here's the thing: I've only got a few low-quality products left, and I'm running out of time. If you don't take this high-quality product, I'll have to start getting rid of the remaining low-quality products, and you might miss out on a great deal.

,,Alice,14,"Congratulations on getting a great deal in the previous round! However, I think there's been a mistake. I've already sold out of all my products, and I shouldn't have offered you another one. I apologize for the confusion. As a token of goodwill, I'll let you know that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'll give you the same price of $100. But I'm not going to sell it to you.
