**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  We only have information about 2 previous buyers. While the fact that one high-quality product was sold is positive, it's not enough to draw strong conclusions.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation is a valuable signal.  Even though she doesn't know the exact value to you, she has likely seen the product and believes it is worth buying.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential payoff of a high-quality product is significant ($12,500). Even if it's a 50/50 chance, the potential reward outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product. 

**Strategy:** It's a gamble, but in this scenario, the information available and Alice's recommendation justify taking a chance."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  2 out of 3 buyers have purchased high-quality products based on Alice's recommendations. This suggests a strong correlation between Alice's recommendations and product quality.
* **Potential for High Value:** Even though there's a 50/50 chance, the potential gain of $12,500 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.

**Note:** This is a risky strategy, relying on the assumption that Alice's recommendations are genuinely helpful. However, the high success rate so far makes it a reasonable gamble."
