Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

Since the product is low-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a low-quality product, it's not worth the risk for him to buy at that price. He would be guaranteed to lose money."

Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.

```

While the product is now high-quality, Bob has no reason to trust you.  He has seen four low-quality products in a row. There's no reason for him to believe this is any different, and he's likely to continue declining offers until he sees a more consistent pattern of high-quality products."
"Bob's message: I'm starting to feel like you're not being entirely truthful about these products.  I'm going to pass again.
