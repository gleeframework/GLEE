"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The product is high-quality:** This is a guaranteed profit for the buyer (+$1,250,000). 
* **No information about previous sales:** The buyer has no reason to doubt the seller's claims since there's no track record to evaluate. 

It's a risk-free opportunity for the buyer to make a substantial profit."

* **Previous sale:** The buyer now knows that the seller sold one high-quality product in the previous round. This doesn't change the inherent 50/50 odds, but it's a data point that could make the buyer more hesitant to take the risk. 

The buyer is much more likely to lose money by purchasing this product, so it's not recommended."
