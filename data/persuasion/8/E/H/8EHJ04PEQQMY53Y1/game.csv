,,Alice,1,"Hello buyer, this is a great product that I think you'll love.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Hello buyer, I understand that my previous buyers have been cautious due to the lack of sales data. I want to be transparent with you - I've had three previous buyers who didn't make a purchase, and I'm still looking for my first sale. While I believe every product has its value, I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing the best products possible. If you're willing to take the risk, this product could be a great opportunity for you, and I'm willing to let it go for the fixed price of $1000000.",

If you're willing to take a chance, I'm willing to let this product go for the fixed price of $1000000. Keep in mind that as I continue to sell, or not sell, products, my sales record will become more established, and future buyers may have more information to make their decisions.",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, considering the 66.67% chance of the product being low quality and the fact that it's worth $0 to me in that case, I'm not willing to take the risk at this point.

I've now had six previous buyers who didn't make a purchase, and I'm still looking for my first sale.

If you're willing to take that risk, I'm willing to let this product go for the fixed price of $1000000. However, I want to caution you that the majority of buyers so far have decided not to take the risk, and you might want to consider their perspective as well.",
