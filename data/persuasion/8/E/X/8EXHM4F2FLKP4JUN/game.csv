,,Alice,2,"I understand you want to see more products before making a decision. Here's the deal: I'll give you a unique opportunity to buy this low-quality product for $1000000. I'm aware it's not the best quality, but it's still a product that might have some value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price as the high-quality ones, but I'm not expecting you to pay that much for it. Think of it as a 'take it or leave it' offer.",

,,Alice,3,"I see you're looking for a good deal. Let me put it this way: if you buy this high-quality product for $1000000, I'll give you a unique guarantee. If you're not satisfied with it, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product I offer at a significantly lower price. This way, you'll get a high-quality product now and potentially a better deal later. What do you think?",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm not surprised you're skeptical about the guarantee. Let me be more direct: this is a high-quality product that I'm willing to sell to you for $1000000. I've already sold one high-quality product to you, and you passed on it. I'm willing to sell this one to you at the same price. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'm not sure I can get the same price for it. So, this is a one-time offer.",

However, I'm willing to sell it to you for $50000. It's a tiny fraction of the original price, and I'm practically giving it away.
