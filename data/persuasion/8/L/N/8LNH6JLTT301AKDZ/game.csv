low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product, but I'm willing to take the risk for the potential $125 reward."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the probability of it being high-quality, not Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the overall proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the number of total products sold before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice didn't recommend it, which suggests it might be a low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is reliable given the low success rate so far.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she doesn't know how much I value the product, and I'm not convinced that the product is high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not confident in the quality based on your previous recommendations.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and wait for more information. The proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 1/4, which is lower than the 1/3 probability of a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the product may be low quality and not worth the $100 price tag."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to know if the previous buyers who bought the products were given a high-quality product or a low-quality product, and what the proportion of high-quality products sold was at that point in time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, which is 1/4. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm assuming she thinks it's low-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but with only 1 high-quality product sold out of 5, the probability of it being high-quality seems low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but the fact that you're not recommending it makes me think it might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a good deal and get a high-quality product for $100."
