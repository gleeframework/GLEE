,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 50% chance of it being high-quality and the 1:1 ratio of high-quality products sold so far, which is not statistically significant. I'm willing to take the risk and purchase the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't think the recommendation is reliable given the low number of sales and the fact that the first buyer didn't get a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for more data to make an informed decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, or is there another reason? I'd like to make an informed decision."
