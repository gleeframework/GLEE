I've sold 7 products so far, and 5 of them have been high-quality, but I'm starting to think that might be due to chance rather than any real trend. This next product is a bit of a wild card - I'm not sure what you'll get. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000, but I want to make it clear that it's a risk. If you're feeling lucky, go for it. If not, you might want to think twice.""}"

I'm not trying to mislead you, but I do want to be transparent about the fact that the numbers might not be entirely representative. This next product is definitely low-quality, and I'm only selling it to you because I need to clear out some inventory.
