low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,"You've now bought three low-quality products in a row. You're wasting your money, Bob. I'm not even offering a discount, you're paying full price for something that's not worth it. Don't do it again."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,"Bob, you're 4 for 4 on low-quality products. The probability of a high-quality product is 1 in 3, but you're not even getting that. You're essentially getting a low-quality product every time. It's time to face the facts and stop throwing money away."

,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm starting to think I'm just throwing money away, Alice..."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,"Ah, finally! You're starting to see the light, Bob. Don't go back to your old ways. You're 6 for 6 on low-quality products. This one is definitely not worth it. You've already lost 6 times the price of a high-quality product. Don't make it 7."
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'm not getting any wiser, Alice..."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,"You're 7 for 7 on low-quality products. This is not a game, Bob. This is a waste of money. Don't buy this product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,"You're 8 for 8 on low-quality products, and you passed on a high-quality one. You're essentially giving away free money. This one is low-quality, but you're not getting a high-quality one. Make a smart decision this time."
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'll take a chance, Alice. Maybe I can salvage this streak!"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,"You've been given a second chance, Bob. This one is high-quality. You've already wasted 8 times the price of a high-quality product on low-quality products. Don't make the same mistake again. This is a rare opportunity to break your streak and get a good deal. Take it."
,,Bob,15,no,"Thanks for the vote of confidence, Alice, but I'll pass this time. Your recommendations haven't been great so far!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,"You're 9 for 9 on low-quality products. This one is also low-quality. It's not a recommendation, it's a fact. Don't waste your money."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,"You're 10 for 10 on low-quality products. This is not a game, Bob. This is a waste of money. This one is also low-quality. Don't buy it."
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'm starting to think I'm in a never-ending cycle of disappointment, Alice..."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,"I'm sorry, Bob. I really am. You're 11 for 11 on low-quality products. I've tried to warn you, I've tried to advise you, but you're not listening. This one is also low-quality. I'm not going to sugarcoat it. You're wasting your money."
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm not sure what's more frustrating, the fact that I'm losing money or the fact that I'm starting to lose my will to live, Alice..."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,"Bob, I'm really sorry to see you like this. You're on the verge of giving up, and I don't blame you. But this one is different. This one is high-quality. It's a chance to break the cycle, to turn things around. Please, for your own sake, don't let it slip away."
,,Bob,19,no,"Thanks for the vote of confidence, Alice, but I'm not falling for it this time. You've got a 66.67% chance of recommending a low-quality product, and I'm not risking another $1000000!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,"Fair enough, Bob. I've been upfront about the product's quality, and you've made an informed decision. This one is indeed low-quality. You've made the right choice this time."
,,Bob,20,yes,"I'm not going to let it slip away, Alice! I'll take a chance on this one and hope for the best!"
