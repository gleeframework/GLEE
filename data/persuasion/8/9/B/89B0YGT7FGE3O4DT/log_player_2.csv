**Reasoning:**

Since the product is recommended by Alice, and the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, it is likely that this product is also high quality.  Even though the odds are 50/50, the recommendation adds valuable information. The potential gain ($12,000) outweighs the potential loss ($0) in this case."
