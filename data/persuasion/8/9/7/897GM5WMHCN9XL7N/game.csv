low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't have any prior information to go on, so I'll just have to take a chance"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your previous recommendation doesn't carry much weight since you don't know my valuation of the product. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, hoping it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have passed on the products, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think it's likely that the products that have been sold are low-quality. If I buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll be out $1000000. I'd rather wait and see if the next product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales so far and the lack of high-quality products sold. I'd like to buy the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the previous sales record, I'm inclined to think that the product is more likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low number of sales and the fact that you didn't recommend it. I'd like to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendations are based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that no high-quality product has been sold yet."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the low probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because you think it's low quality based on the statistics?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending the product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold among the 6 previous buyers."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's previous recommendations have been very unhelpful. I'm essentially guessing that the product might be high-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 buyers have purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being offered has decreased. I'll wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Can you share the probability with me?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 out of 8 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and all of them were low-quality products, I suspect that Alice's recommendation is likely to be based on the product being low-quality. I'd rather wait for a recommendation to buy a product from a buyer who received a recommendation to pass, which would suggest a higher likelihood of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the statistics, 8 out of 8 products were low quality, which is a 100% failure rate. I'm inclined to trust Alice's recommendation and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the previous sales record or something else?"
