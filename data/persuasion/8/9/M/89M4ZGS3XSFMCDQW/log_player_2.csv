**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  There's only one data point (1 high-quality product sold) and we don't know the quality of the product sold to the first buyer. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the purchase adds a significant amount of value.  While she may not know the specific quality of *this* product, she likely has some criteria for making recommendations.
* **Potential Upside:** Even if there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential payoff of $200 if it's high quality outweighs the risk.

**Important Note:** This is a risky decision, as we're relying heavily on Alice's judgment.  However, with limited information, it's a reasonable gamble."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The statistics show a 100% success rate for buyers who followed Alice's recommendations. This is extremely strong evidence that Alice's recommendations are reliable.
* **Potential Gain:** Even with the 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of a high-quality product ($200 value to you) outweighs the risk.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice is likely to want to maintain a good reputation and high sales. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume she's genuinely trying to recommend products that will be beneficial to buyers."
