,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to see the statistics of the first sale before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer and I want to take advantage of the information that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, which implies that the probability of the current product being high-quality is 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and pay $1000000 for the product, hoping to get a high-quality product worth $2000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling high-quality products, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is based on previous sales and I don't have any information about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait and see the outcome of the next sale to get a better understanding of the product's quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2, which is consistent with the expected value. However, I'd like to see more data to make a more informed decision."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the probability of a high-quality product being offered is 1/3, and the probability of a low-quality product being offered is 2/3. With a 50% chance of a product being high-quality and a 50% chance of being low-quality, the expected value of the product is $500000. I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product with an expected value of $500000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, which is a 33.33% success rate. However, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
