**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** There's only one data point, and it's positive (a high-quality product was sold). 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation carries some weight. While she might not always be truthful, she has an incentive to sell products to maximize her profits.
* **Potential Gain:** The potential gain from a high-quality product ($4,000,000) is significantly higher than the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0).

**Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward outweighs the risk in this case, especially with Alice's recommendation."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  With 2 high-quality products sold out of 2, the success rate is 100%. This is a strong indicator that Alice is reliably recommending high-quality products.
* **Potential Profit:** Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of $4,000,000 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000.

**Important Considerations:**

* This decision is based on the limited information provided.  The game does not explicitly state whether Alice is incentivized to sell high-quality products.  
* In a real-world scenario, a buyer would likely seek more information and consider potential risks before making such a large investment."
