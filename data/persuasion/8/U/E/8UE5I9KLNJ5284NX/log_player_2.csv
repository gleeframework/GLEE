``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No information:** There is no sales data to base a decision on.
* **50/50 odds:** The product has a 50% chance of being high quality, and that's a decent chance.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  While Alice knows the product's quality, she has no incentive to lie (since she gets the same price regardless). Her recommendation is a bit of a signal.

**Overall:** This is a gamble, but it's the best decision with the available information."

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice! I'm willing to take a chance on this product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** There's only one previous sale, making the statistics unreliable.  
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation carries some weight. While she could be trying to sell a low-quality product, there's also a chance she's being honest.
* **Potential Upside:**  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($400) outweighs the potential loss of $100 if the product is low quality.

**Strategy:** This is a gamble, but with a 50/50 chance of a high-quality product, and Alice's recommendation, it's worth taking the risk."
