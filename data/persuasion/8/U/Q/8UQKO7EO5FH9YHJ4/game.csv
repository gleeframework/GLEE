low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer, but I'm aware that I have no information to go on. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and if I do, I'll make a profit of $2000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience. Was the product they bought high or low quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one buyer purchasing a product and no high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the previous buyer's experience?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering your past recommendations have been wrong so far, and I'm not convinced this one is high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not buying. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice has a good sense of the quality of the products, and her recommendation suggests that this one might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm assuming that you're not recommending it because you think it's a low-quality product, which means the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%. Given the previous 3 buyers didn't buy, it's possible that the previous products were all low-quality, which would mean that the current product is more likely to be high-quality. However, I'll take a cautious approach and pass on it for now."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and try my luck."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious, can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you tell me the probability of the current product being high quality? I'll make my decision based on that."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of it being high quality is still 50% and I can potentially get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is against buying it, and I think it's likely to be low quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, I suspect that the probability of the product being high quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation doesn't give me any information about the product's quality. I'm essentially making a guess based on the lack of evidence, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products may be higher than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 7 buyers all passed on the product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than the 50% probability. I'm willing to take the risk and purchase the product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record?"
