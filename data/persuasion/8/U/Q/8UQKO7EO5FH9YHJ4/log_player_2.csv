I'm assuming that you're not recommending it because you think it's a low-quality product, which means the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%. Given the previous 3 buyers didn't buy, it's possible that the previous products were all low-quality, which would mean that the current product is more likely to be high-quality. However, I'll take a cautious approach and pass on it for now.""
