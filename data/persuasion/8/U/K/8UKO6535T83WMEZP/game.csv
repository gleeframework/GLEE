,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I don't have any prior information about the product's quality, and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for the potential reward of a high-quality product."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that the previous buyer was also recommended to buy it, but it was a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that all previous recommendations from you resulted in a sale, and none of the products sold were high quality. This makes me suspect that the products that were recommended were likely low quality, so I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that the first buyer didn't buy, which might be due to the low quality of the product. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product to see if it's actually high-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I would like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers who received a recommendation from you to buy the product did not end up buying it, I'm inclined to think that the products they received were low-quality. This increases my skepticism about the quality of the current product, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the same price of $10000. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm willing to take a chance on this one, but I want to make sure I'm not being taken advantage of."
