high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I respect your desire to inspect the product before making a decision. However, I have to be honest with you - this product is a one-of-a-kind item, and it's not something that can be easily replicated or replaced. If you don't take it, I'm not sure when or if I'll be able to offer something similar again. I'm willing to make an exception and let you inspect the product in person, but I need to warn you that it's a rare opportunity, and I'm not sure how long I'll be able to hold onto it.

,,Alice,11,"I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to be honest with you - this next product is not worth the high price you're suggesting.
