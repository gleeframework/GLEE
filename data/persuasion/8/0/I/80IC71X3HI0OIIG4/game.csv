high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and 0 total products. I'm looking to sell this one to you today, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it!",
,,the buyer,1,Thank you for the offer. I believe in your products and am willing to take the risk. Let's make this deal.,yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, out of a total of 2 products. I'm glad you're interested in this one. I want to assure you that this product is also of the highest quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000. However, I want to mention that the probability of a product being high-quality is only 50%, so you're taking a risk by buying from me. I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee' of sorts: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a detailed explanation of why I thought it was high-quality, and I'll even offer you a chance to buy the next product at a discounted price. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,2,Thank you for the detailed explanation and the guarantee. I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product.,yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, out of a total of 3 products. I'm glad you're interested in this one. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, but I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row now. This might be a good opportunity for you to take advantage of a hot streak. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. However, I want to mention that the law of averages suggests that the next product might be low-quality, so you might want to consider waiting for the next one.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the information. Given the positive feedback and the confidence you have in the product, I believe it's a good opportunity to make a purchase. I'm looking forward to receiving the product and hope it meets my expectations.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, out of a total of 4 products. You might be wondering if this is a lucky streak, or if I've somehow figured out how to guarantee high-quality products. I'll let you in on a secret: I don't have any special insight, and the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I do want to point out that the law of averages suggests that a low-quality product is overdue, and this might be a good opportunity for you to buy a high-quality product at a 'discounted' price of $10000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,4,"I trust the odds and believe in the law of averages. Given the information provided, I think it's a good time to purchase the product. Let's hope for a high-quality item!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, but the streak has been broken. This product is actually of lower quality than I thought. I want to be transparent with you: I've sold 4 high-quality products out of a total of 5 products, which is a higher proportion than the 50% probability would suggest. This might be a sign that I've been getting lucky, or it might be a sign that I've been selling high-quality products more often than I thought. Either way, I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $10000, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of the opportunity to buy at a 'discount'.",

I want to assure you that I'm not trying to hide anything from you. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, and I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $10000. However, I want to point out that the law of averages suggests that I'm due for a high-quality product, and you might be getting a good deal if you buy this one.",
