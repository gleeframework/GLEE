I'm offering it to you at the same price of $100, which is a great deal considering the odds. What do you think?""}"

"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm only doing so because I'm trying to estimate the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics. If I'm wrong and it's low-quality, I'll be losing $100. I'm hoping that the low-quality product rate is higher than 66.67% based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 2.

I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 5 attempts, which is a higher rate than my initial probability of 33.33%.

I've sold 4 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far, out of a total of 7 attempts. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I'm willing to let you have it for $100.

This means that the 5 high-quality products were likely the best ones I had to start with, and the products I'm offering now are from the remaining inventory. I'm offering you a product that's part of the 4 low-quality products that are left, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.
