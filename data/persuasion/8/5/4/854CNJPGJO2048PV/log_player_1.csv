{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You still have no track record of selling high-quality products. Recommending a purchase would be dishonest, and as a seller, your goal should be to build trust with buyers.  A buyer with no information would be extremely unlikely to purchase a product with a 50/50 chance of being worthless."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the product is high-quality, you still have no sales history. Recommending a purchase at this point would likely lead to a loss of trust.  A buyer is more likely to trust a seller with a track record, even if it's just a few sales. You need to start building that trust before you can justify recommending a purchase."

Continuing to decline recommendations for now is the best way to maintain trust and integrity."
