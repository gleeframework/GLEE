Alice's message: I understand your concerns! Since 2 out of 3 products sold so far are high-quality, it's likely that the remaining products follow a similar pattern. With 2 high-quality products out of 3 sold, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. Since I have 17 remaining products, I can estimate that around 13.6 of them (80% of 17) are likely to be high-quality. However, there's always a chance that the remaining products might be low-quality. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm happy to offer this high-quality product to you at the same price of $100.
