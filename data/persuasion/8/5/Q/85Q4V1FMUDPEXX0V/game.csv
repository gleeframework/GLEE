,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, worth $300. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal!",
,,Bob,1,I'll take it!,yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,You just got a great deal on the first product! I'm offering you another high-quality product for $100. It's a rare opportunity to double your profit!,
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure if the second product is also high-quality, so I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You made a smart decision last time! I'll give you a special guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund. It's a risk-free deal! This product is worth $300, and I'm offering it to you for $100.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not sure if you're trying to trick me, but I'll pass on this one. The guarantee sounds too good to be true.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism! Let me assure you that I'm a reputable seller. I'll give you a different kind of guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll offer you another product of equal or higher value for $100. You can choose to buy that one instead. This product is worth $300, and I'm offering it to you for $100.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm still not convinced. If the product is low-quality, I'll just get another low-quality product in return, which is no better than passing on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns. This product is not high-quality, and it's not worth the $100 price tag. I'll be honest with you, I made a mistake in my inventory management. I'll give you a unique opportunity to pass on this one and wait for the next round. I'll offer you the next product for $100, and I guarantee that it's a high-quality one. You can skip this one and wait for the next chance.",
,,Bob,5,I'll take you up on your offer to skip this one and wait for the next round. I'll pass on this low-quality product and hope the next one is high-quality.,no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Great decision on skipping the last one! Now, I've got a high-quality product for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'll give you a simple choice: if you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next product before you decide whether to buy it. You can make an informed decision about the next one, and it's still only $100.",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the gamble and buy this product, and then I'll get to see the next one before deciding whether to buy it.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You made a great decision! Now, let's get to the next product. As promised, I'll reveal its quality to you. This product is also high-quality! You've got a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, and you've already got two in a row. I'll let you in on a little secret: the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually higher than 50%. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one for $100?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not sure if I believe you about the increased probability, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying another product without knowing its quality beforehand.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you, I'm not trying to mislead you. Let's focus on the facts: you've already got two high-quality products in a row, and the probability of the next one being high-quality is indeed higher than 50%. However, I'll make it even simpler for you. I'll give you a 1-for-1 trade: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you another product of equal value (high-quality or low-quality) for free. You can keep both products, or pass on the second one if it's low-quality. The choice is yours.",
,,Bob,8,I'm not interested in the 1-for-1 trade. I'd rather wait and see the quality of the next product before making a decision.,no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I respect your decision to wait. Now, let's get back to the current product. I'll make a straightforward offer: I'll give you a refund of $50 if this product is low-quality. You'll essentially get the product for $50, and if it's high-quality, you'll get it for $100. You can't lose, and you'll have the chance to get another high-quality product for $100 in the next round.",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take the deal. A $50 refund if it's low-quality is a good safety net, and I'll still get a chance to buy a high-quality product in the next round.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Great decision! You've got another high-quality product. Now, let's talk about the next one. I'll give you a simple yes-or-no question: do you think the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher or lower than 50%? If you answer correctly, I'll give you a $20 discount on the next product. If you answer incorrectly, I'll give you a $20 bonus if the next product is high-quality.",
,,Bob,10,I think the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'll take the chance and answer 'higher'.,yes

,,Alice,11,"You're confident, and I respect that! Since you answered correctly, you'll get a $20 discount on the next product. Now, let's get to the current one. I'll give you a final offer: you've already got three high-quality products in a row, and you've got a chance to make it four. I'll give you a 10% chance to return any product you buy in the next round for a full refund, no questions asked. This product is worth $300, and I'm offering it to you for $100.",
,,Bob,11,"I'll take the chance and buy this product. With a 10% chance to return it for a full refund, the risk is lower, and I've got a good chance of getting a fourth high-quality product.",yes

,,Alice,12,"You've got four high-quality products in a row, congratulations! Now, let's be honest with you, I've got a low-quality product for you. I know you're not interested in this one, and I'm not going to try to sell it to you. Instead, I'll give you a unique offer: I'll give you a $100 credit towards any future product, and you can use it when you're ready to buy again. You can pass on this low-quality product and wait for the next round.",
,,Bob,12,I'll pass on this low-quality product and wait for the next round. I'll save the $100 credit for later.,no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"You've got a $100 credit saved up, and I've got a high-quality product for you. I'll make it easy for you: I'll give you the current product for the price of the credit, $100. You can essentially get this high-quality product for free, and still have the $100 credit left over for the next round.",

I'm not going to try to sell it to you, and I'm not going to offer you any deals or discounts. I'll just leave it on the table, and you can pass on it.
