,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. If you buy it, I'll give you a chance to buy the next one at the same price. If you don't buy it, the next product will be the first one you'll see, and you won't have this opportunity. The price is $100. It's a one-time offer.",
,,Bob,1,I'll take the chance to buy the current product,yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took the chance! This next product is actually high-quality, which is 4 times more valuable than the last one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a 20% discount off its true value. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else at the full price.",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the chance to buy the current product, considering it's high-quality and 4 times more valuable than the last one",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're on a roll! I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase. This next product is actually a bit of a wild card. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I'll give you a special deal: if you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a $50 discount on the next product. If it's low-quality, no hard feelings, just the standard price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the chance to buy the current product, considering the potential discount on the next product",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're really making the most of this deal! This next product is high-quality, and I'll let you in on a secret: I've already sold two high-quality products to you, which means I'm getting a bit anxious to make room for new inventory. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $80, which is a 20% discount off the standard price of $100. It's a one-time offer, so what do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the chance to buy the current product, considering the discount and the fact that you're willing to make room for new inventory",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're really helping me clear out some space! This next product is high-quality, and I'll let you know that I've got a few more high-quality products in the pipeline. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might not be able to sell them all, and I'd rather not have to discount them. So, I'm willing to sell this one to you for the standard price of $100. It's a fair deal, considering the quality and the scarcity of the next few products I have in stock.",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the chance to buy the current product, considering the quality and the scarcity of the next products you have in stock",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're really helping me out! This next product is also high-quality, and I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to feel a bit of pressure to sell it. I've got a lot of low-quality products coming up, and I'm not sure how they'll be received. So, I'm willing to sell this one to you for $120, which is a 20% premium over the standard price. It's a bit of a risk, but I think it's worth it to get this high-quality product off my hands.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not willing to pay a 20% premium for this product, considering the standard price is already $100. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"No worries, I understand your hesitation. This next product is actually a low-quality one, and I'm not expecting much from it. In fact, I'm willing to let you have it for $80, which is a 20% discount off the standard price. It's a bit of a throwaway, but it might be worth it if you're looking to complete a set or something.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discount. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,

I'm willing to sell this one to you for the standard price of $100, but I'll throw in a bonus: if you buy this one and it's the last high-quality product I have, I'll give you a $20 gift card to use on your next purchase.",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the chance to buy the current product, considering the high quality and the bonus gift card",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're really helping me out! This next product is actually a low-quality one, and I'm being upfront with you about it. I'm not expecting much from it, and I'm willing to let you have it for the standard price of $100. However, I'll make a deal with you: if you buy this one and it's the last low-quality product I have, I'll give you a $50 credit towards a future purchase of a high-quality product. It's not much, but it's something, right?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the promise of a credit towards a future purchase. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,10,"No worries, I understand you're being cautious. This next product is actually a low-quality one, and I'm not expecting much from it. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to get a bit desperate to get rid of it, so I'm willing to sell it to you for $80, which is a 20% discount off the standard price. It's a bit of a desperation sale, but it's a good opportunity if you're looking for a deal.",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm running out of high-quality products, and I'm getting a bit worried that I'll have to start selling the low-quality ones at full price. This next product is high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the standard price of $100. But I'll throw in a twist: if you buy this one, I'll give you a 'golden ticket' that guarantees you get to buy the next product at 50% off, regardless of its quality. It's a one-time offer, and it's a great chance to get a deal on the next product.",

,,Alice,14,"You're really taking advantage of my desperation! This next product is high-quality, and I'm running out of high-quality products. I'll be honest with you, I'm not sure how much longer I can keep selling at the standard price. I'll sell this product to you for $100, but I'll also give you a 'last-chance' offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if the next product is low-quality. It's a one-time offer, and it's a way to guarantee that you get a high-quality product, no matter what.",

,,Alice,17,"Well, it's been a wild ride, hasn't it? This next product is actually a low-quality one, and I'm not expecting much from it. I'm not even going to try to sell it to you, I'll just be honest with you. I'll give it to you for $50, which is a 50% discount off the standard price. It's a 'going-out-of-business' sale, and I'm just trying to clear out the last of my inventory.",
