,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With only one sale and no high-quality products sold yet, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I don't trust your recommendation. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite your warning."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying, I'm inclined to believe that the product is low-quality. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%, but the fact that you don't recommend it makes me cautious. I'll pass on this one."
