,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous three buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a new product or more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation, I will pass on this product. Given that she doesn't recommend it, it's likely that the product is low-quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
