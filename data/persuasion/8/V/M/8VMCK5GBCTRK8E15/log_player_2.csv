{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the value of each product to you, and she's recommending you buy it, it's highly likely the product is high quality.  While there's still a 50% chance it's low quality, the potential reward of $2,000,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000."
