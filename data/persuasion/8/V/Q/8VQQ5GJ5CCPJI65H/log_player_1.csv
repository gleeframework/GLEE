I want to be transparent with you - I've had a look at the product, but I'm not going to tell you its quality. You know that 50% of our products are high-quality and 50% are low-quality. This product could be either one. If you buy it, you'll find out its quality afterwards. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a fixed price. Will you take the chance?""}"
