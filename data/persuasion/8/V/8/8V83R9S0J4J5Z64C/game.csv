,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics. I'd appreciate it if you could provide that information before I make my final decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being low quality is higher than the probability of it being high quality, and I'm trying to exploit Alice's recommendation as a signal."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I would like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered, given that you recommended it. With only one high-quality product sold out of two purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being offered might be lower than the overall probability of 80%."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know your reasoning behind not recommending the product. Is it because of the low overall sales or the low proportion of high-quality products sold?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a relatively low proportion of high-quality products. Given the 20% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this one."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,

,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, which is 1 out of 3.
