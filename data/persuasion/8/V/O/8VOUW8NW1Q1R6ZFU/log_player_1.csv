The fact that I've only sold 1 high-quality product suggests that the probability might be lower. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10,000, but I want to acknowledge the uncertainty. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll throw in a bonus: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a refund of $1,000. It's a small gesture of goodwill, but it might make the risk more palatable.""
}"
