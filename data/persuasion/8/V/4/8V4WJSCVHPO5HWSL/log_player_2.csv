I know that 3 out of 6 buyers have purchased high-quality products, which is a 50% success rate. However, this is actually lower than the expected 50% success rate if the products were randomly high or low quality. This suggests that the products sold so far may have been biased towards being high quality. Given that you're not recommending the product, I'm going to take a chance and buy it.""
