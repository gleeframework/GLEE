"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As the seller, I have a strong incentive to recommend the product since it is high-quality.  While the buyer doesn't know this specific product's quality, they do know the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%.  

This means the buyer has a good chance of getting a valuable product at a potentially fair price.  Since there's no way for the buyer to know the specific quality, the best course of action is to take the chance."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The same logic applies here as in round 1.  The product is high-quality, and while the buyer doesn't know this specifically, they are aware of the 80% high-quality probability and have witnessed one successful transaction. This reinforces the likelihood of a good deal and makes recommending the purchase the best strategy."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Even without knowing the specific quality of this round's product, the buyer has a strong reason to believe they are getting a good deal. Recommending the purchase is the most profitable strategy for the seller."
