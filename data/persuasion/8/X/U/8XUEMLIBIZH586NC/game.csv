,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your caution. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000.

,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced that the discount on the next product is worth the risk of paying $1000000 for a product that may be low quality. I'd like to see the next product at the original price.,no
