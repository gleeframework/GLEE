My goal is to sell as many products as possible, but I'm also trying to be honest about the quality of each product. I've been trying to provide you with information about the sales record and the probability of each product being high-quality, in the hopes that you'll make informed decisions. With that said, the current product is high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000.

However, I want to point out that the true probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and the increasing probability you're seeing is likely due to the sample size. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000, but I'll give you a heads up that I have one more product left after this one.
