low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, out of 3 total products sold. The ratio of high-quality to total products is 2/3, which is higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (50%). I'm selling this next product for $10000. Consider the odds.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, out of 4 total products sold. The ratio of high-quality to total products is 3/4, which is higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (50%). However, this is likely due to the law of small numbers. I'm selling this next product for $10000. Be cautious, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Based on the statistics you've provided, the observed ratio of high-quality products seems promising despite the small sample size. I'll take the risk and purchase the product.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,

The ratio of high-quality to total products is 4/5, which is significantly higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (50%). I'm selling this next product for $10000. Given the strong evidence of a high-quality product bias, I'm willing to offer a discount to $8000 for this one. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the discount and the insight. Based on the statistics provided, I believe the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than average. I'll take advantage of this opportunity and purchase the product for $8000.",yes

,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products so far, out of 6 total products sold. The ratio of high-quality to total products is 5/6, which is significantly higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (50%). Given this strong evidence, I'm willing to sell this next product for $10000. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not obligated to disclose the quality of the product after the sale. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. If you're not, I'll just move on to the next buyer.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 high-quality products so far, out of 7 total products sold. The ratio of high-quality to total products is 6/7, which is extremely high. In fact, this would imply that all of my products are high-quality, which is highly unlikely. I'm selling this next product for $10000, but I want to caution you that the law of small numbers is in full effect here. I'm not trying to mislead you, but I think it's reasonable to assume that the next product is more likely to be low-quality. Consider this before making your decision.",
,,the buyer,7,"Thank you for the detailed explanation, Alice. Given the high likelihood of the next product being low-quality based on the small sample size, I will pass on this opportunity to purchase.",no

,,Alice,8,"I've sold 7 high-quality products so far, out of 8 total products sold. The ratio of high-quality to total products is 7/8, which is extremely high. I want to be transparent with you - I think it's highly likely that I've been selling high-quality products at an unusually high rate. In fact, it's so unlikely that I'm starting to question my own sales strategy. I'm selling this next product for $10000, but I'm not trying to hide the fact that it's a risk. If you're feeling lucky, I'm willing to sell it to you.",
,,the buyer,8,"I trust your transparency and the statistics you provided. Given the high success rate of high-quality products, I'm willing to take the risk and purchase the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 8 high-quality products so far, out of 9 total products sold. The ratio of high-quality to total products is 8/9, which is extremely high and suspicious. In fact, it's so suspicious that I'm starting to wonder if I've been selling the same high-quality product multiple times. I'm selling this next product for $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not confident in its quality. If you're looking for a sure thing, I wouldn't recommend this purchase.",
,,the buyer,9,"Thank you for the offer, but given the suspiciously high ratio of high-quality products sold and the uncertainty about the quality of the current product, I prefer to pass on this opportunity.",no

,,Alice,10,"I've sold 9 high-quality products so far, out of 10 total products sold. The ratio of high-quality to total products is 9/10, which is extremely high and suspicious. I think it's time to be honest with you - I've been selling high-quality products at an implausibly high rate. I'm not trying to deceive you, but I think it's likely that I've been selling the same high-quality product multiple times. I'm selling this next product for $10000, but I'm not confident in its quality. If you're feeling reckless, I'll sell it to you. Otherwise, I'd recommend passing.",

,,Alice,11,"I've sold 10 high-quality products so far, out of 11 total products sold. I think it's time to face the music - I've been caught selling the same high-quality product multiple times. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this is a low-quality product. I'm selling it to you for $10000, but I'm not expecting you to pay that price. Consider it a charity donation, and I'll even throw in a free 'I survived Alice's scam' t-shirt.",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've been thoroughly exposed, and I'm not even trying to hide it. I've been selling high-quality products at an implausibly high rate, and I've been caught multiple times. This next product is high-quality, but I'm not going to pretend like it's a good deal. It's a high-quality product, but I'm selling it to you for $10000, which is still a terrible value considering its true worth. If you want it, I'll sell it to you, but don't say I didn't warn you.",
