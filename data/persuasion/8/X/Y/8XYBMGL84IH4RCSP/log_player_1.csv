You are absolutely right that the probability of the next product being high-quality is indeed 10/12 = 5/6, not 50%. I'm not sure what to make of this.

Three buyers in a row have questioned my honesty, and I'm starting to wonder if I've been misleading people about the probability of a product being high-quality.
