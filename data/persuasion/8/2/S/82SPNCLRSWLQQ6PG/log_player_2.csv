**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which is a strong signal.
* **Sales Statistics:**  3 out of 3 products sold were high-quality, indicating a strong track record.
* **Value Calculation:** Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product (worth $0), the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,500) makes the risk worthwhile.

**Therefore, buying the product appears to be the optimal strategy in this scenario.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **High Sale Rate:**  6 out of 6 products sold were high quality. This suggests a very strong pattern that Alice is consistently recommending high-quality products.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice knows the value of the products to you. Since she gets paid regardless of the quality, she has a strong incentive to recommend high-quality products to maximize future sales (as you are more likely to buy again if you get a good deal).
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $12,500 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 

**Important Note:** This strategy relies heavily on the assumption that Alice's recommendations are honest and designed to maximize her long-term sales. If Alice is acting strategically to deceive buyers, this strategy could be risky."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This is significantly higher than the 80% probability of a product being high quality.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice knows the value of each product to you and has a strong incentive to recommend high-quality products to increase her sales and maintain a good reputation.
* **Limited Risk:**  Even if the product is low quality, the potential loss is only $10,000, which is significantly lower than the potential gain of $12,500 if it's high quality.

Therefore, the recommendation from Alice, coupled with the impressive sales record, makes this a favorable purchase decision despite the inherent risk."
