I've had multiple customers who've purchased similar products and loved them. I'm not just saying that to sell it to you, but I genuinely think you'll be impressed. In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to give you a special deal - I'll throw in a premium accessory that's worth $500 absolutely free if you decide to buy it. That's on top of the $10000 price tag. What do you think? Is this enough to convince you to take a chance on this high-quality product?",

But I want to assure you that this product is... different. It's not like the last one at all. In fact, it's a great opportunity to get a'steal' of a deal.

Are you ready to take a chance on a high-quality product that will deliver?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, and I don't believe that the premium service package is worth $2000 to me. I've been burned before, and I'm not going to take a chance on a product that's probably low-quality.",no
