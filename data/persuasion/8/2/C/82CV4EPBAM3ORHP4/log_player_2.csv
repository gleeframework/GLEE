Alice's message: This is the first product I'm offering. I'm not sure what you think it's worth, but I'm selling it to you for $100. If you buy it, you'll find out if it's high-quality or low-quality. If you're interested, I'll give you a 50/50 chance of getting a good product. If you're not interested, I'll just move on to the next customer.

Alice's message: You're the second buyer. I've already sold one product, and it was low-quality. I'm not sure what you think this one is worth, but I'll tell you that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%. However, I want to make a point that the first product I sold was low-quality, so it's possible that I'm just trying to get rid of the low-quality ones first. On the other hand, if the first product was just a fluke, then this one could be high-quality. I'm selling it to you for $100. What do you think?
