**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which is a positive signal.
* **Limited Data:** While the data is limited (only 2 previous buyers),  the fact that one high-quality product was sold out of two suggests a higher than expected probability of the current product also being high-quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a $2,000,000 profit outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000.  

**Note:** This is a calculated risk, as the probability of the product being low-quality is still significant (50%).  The decision is based on the available information and the potential reward outweighing the risk."
