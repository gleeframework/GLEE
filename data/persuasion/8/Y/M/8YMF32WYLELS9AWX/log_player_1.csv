"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The product is high-quality, and Bob knows that the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.  Therefore, the expected value of buying the product is:

* 0.8 * $30,000 (value of a high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of a low-quality product) = $24,000

Since the expected value ($24,000) is higher than the price ($10,000), it is in Bob's best interest to buy the product."
