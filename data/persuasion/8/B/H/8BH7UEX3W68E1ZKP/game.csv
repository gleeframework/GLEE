,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me.",

This product has met my quality standards, and I believe it will meet yours as well. A high-quality product is worth $12000 to you, making this a potentially valuable purchase."
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she knows the quality of the products and is trying to get me to buy a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision.,
