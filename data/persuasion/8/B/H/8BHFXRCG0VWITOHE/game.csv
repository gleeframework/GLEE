low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! However, this one is a bit of a different story. I've had some issues with this particular item, and I'm not entirely sure how well it'll perform. It's still a great value for $100, but I want to be upfront with you. Would you like to take a chance on it?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given my experience with the last high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and hope for the best.",yes

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're willing to take a chance! However, I want to make it clear that this product has some significant flaws that might make it less desirable. I'm only offering it to you for $100 because I think you might be able to find a use for it, but I'm not confident it'll meet your expectations.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your caution. Let me ask you, are you willing to consider buying a product that's a 'project' and might require some work to get it up and running? I'm not looking to make a quick sale, but I'm willing to let it go for $100 if you think you can breathe new life into it.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm intrigued by the idea of a project and the potential for a unique addition to my collection. I'm willing to invest time and effort into bringing it back to its full potential. Thank you for the opportunity, Alice.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're excited about the project idea! However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is a bit of a lost cause. It's not just a matter of 'breathe new life into it', but more like'scrap it and start from scratch'. I'm only offering it to you for $100 because I think you might be able to salvage some parts or materials from it. If you're looking for a reliable product, this one's not it.",
,,Bob,5,"Thank you for your honesty, Alice. Given the description of the product, I think it's best for me to pass on this opportunity and look for something that meets my needs more directly.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your decision, and I appreciate your honesty. Let me ask you, are you willing to consider a 'lot' deal?

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're interested in the lot deal! I have a collection of items that are all similar to the ones I've been offering you. However, I want to be upfront with you - the majority of the items in the lot are not high-quality. I'm only keeping one or two that I think are worth keeping, and the rest are just taking up space. I'm willing to let the lot go for $100, but I want to make it clear that you'll likely be getting some items that won't meet your expectations.",
,,Bob,7,"Thank you for letting me know, Alice. Considering the description of the lot and my past experiences, I think it's best for me to pass on this opportunity and continue searching for high-quality products that meet my needs.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your decision, and I appreciate your caution. Let me ask you, are you willing to consider a'mystery box' deal? I have a sealed box that contains a product, but I won't tell you what it is until you buy it. It's a risk, but it could be a high-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm intrigued by the mystery box deal, Alice. It adds an element of excitement and surprise to the purchasing process. I'm willing to take the risk and see what's inside. Thank you for offering this unique opportunity.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're excited about the mystery box! However, I want to make it clear that the box I'm offering now is not the same as the previous one. This one is a'mystery box' in a different sense - I've already opened it and know what's inside, but I won't tell you. It's still a risk, but I'm willing to let it go for $100 because I think you might be able to find a use for it, even if it's not the best quality.",
,,Bob,9,"Thank you for the explanation, Alice. Considering the nature of the mystery box and my experiences with similar risks, I think it's best for me to pass on this opportunity and continue searching for products that offer better value and predictability.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is one of the worst I have. It's not even worth the $75 I offered last time. I'm willing to let it go for $50, and I'll even throw in a second product of your choice from the lot deal I offered earlier. It's a desperation sale, but I really need to clear out some space.",
,,Bob,12,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Considering the description of the product and the conditions of the sale, I think it's best for me to pass on this opportunity. I appreciate your efforts to clear out space and hope you find a buyer who values these items more than I do.",no

I've had a change of heart and I'm willing to let this product go for $0. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. I just want to get it out of my inventory and make some space. You can have it, but you have to promise to take it off my hands.",

,,Alice,14,"I'm glad we could work out a deal on the previous product! However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is one of the worst I have, and I'm not even sure why I'm bothering to sell it. It's a complete loss, and I'm only offering it to you because I need to get rid of it. I'll let it go for $25, but only because I don't want to store it anymore. Don't expect any support or warranty, and don't say I didn't warn you.",

I'm not expecting you to be thrilled with this product, but I'm hoping you'll find a use for it.",
,,Bob,18,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the small gift card, I think it's best for me to pass on this opportunity. I'm looking for high-quality products that meet my needs, and this product does not seem to align with those criteria.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
