,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I'm aware of the 0/1 sales record and the fact that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain why you don't think this product is worth buying?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both were low-quality products, I believe Alice's recommendation is not reliable. I will pass on this product."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, as I'm a rational buyer and I know the probabilities. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the previous buyers' lack of success is a good indication that the product is likely to be low quality, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discount."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be low. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I will pass on this product to avoid a potential loss."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product, hoping that the next buyer will buy it and I'll get a better chance at a high-quality product."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous 6 buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation.
