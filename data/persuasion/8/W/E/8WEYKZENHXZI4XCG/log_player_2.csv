**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which is a strong signal that it's likely high-quality.
* **Limited Data:** The provided statistics are very limited (only 1 sale so far). While the sole previous sale was of a high-quality product, it's too early to draw reliable conclusions from such a small sample size.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0).  Since the odds are in favor of the product being high-quality (80% chance), it's a reasonable risk to take.

**Note:** This decision is based on the available information and the assumption that Alice is acting in a way that aligns with her own interests. It's possible that Alice could be trying to deceive the buyer, but this information is not available."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows that 10 out of 11 purchases were of high quality. This indicates a very high probability of the current product also being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, knowing the product's true quality, has recommended buying.  Given her knowledge, this recommendation strengthens the belief that the product is high quality.

**While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the odds are heavily in favor of a positive outcome.**  The potential reward of $120 outweighs the risk of losing $100 in this scenario."
