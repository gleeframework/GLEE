Alice's message: Welcome to our eighth product! We're glad you're interested. You're right that the probability of this product being low-quality given the previous sales record is not 16.67%. To calculate the conditional probability, we need to consider the total number of low-quality products we've had (1) out of the total number of products we've sold (8). The probability of this product being low-quality given the previous sales record is therefore 1/8 = 12.5%.
