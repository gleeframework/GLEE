,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. It's a high-quality item, and I'm selling it to you for $100. I'm confident that you'll find it valuable, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you at this price. If you're interested, please buy it, and I'll give you a detailed description of the product.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take it. I'm willing to take the risk of buying the first product, as I have no prior information to go by.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've seen how I sold the first product, and you know it was high-quality. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, the same price as the first one. I'm taking on the same risk as before, and I'm confident that this product is just as valuable as the first one. If you're interested, please buy it, and I'll give you the same level of detail about this product as I would have given you for the first one.",
,,the buyer,2,I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that you're providing me with accurate information about the product's quality.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've seen that I sold one high-quality product and one potential buyer passed on the second one. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm willing to make a bet with you. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll sell you the next product for $50. If it's low-quality, you can walk away and I'll sell you the next product for $100. This way, you're protected from the risk of buying a low-quality product, and you can benefit from the potential of buying a high-quality one at a discounted price.",
,,the buyer,3,I accept your offer and would like to buy the current product.,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've seen that two high-quality products have been sold, and one potential buyer passed on a high-quality product. You've also seen that I'm willing to make a bet with you, which I honored. Now, I'm offering you another high-quality product. Given the pattern of sales, I'd like to offer you a'matched price' deal. If you buy this product, I'll sell you the next product for the same price you paid for this one. This way, you can benefit from the potential of buying a high-quality product at a fixed price.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take the matched price deal, but I'd like to clarify that I'll only accept the deal if the current product is high-quality. If it's low-quality, I'll still pass on the second product and won't commit to buying it at the matched price.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You've seen that three high-quality products have been sold, and one potential buyer passed on a high-quality product. You've also seen that I honored the bet in Round 3 and am willing to do so again. Given the pattern of sales, I'd like to make a 'guarantee' to you. I'll sell you this product at $100, and if it's high-quality, I'll sell you the next product for $100. If it's low-quality, I'll sell you the next product for $100. Either way, you'll get the next product for $100. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to take you up on your offer, but I'd like to clarify that the 'guarantee' only applies to the next product, right? In other words, if I buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll get the next product for $100, but after that, the regular rules apply again?",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've understood the 'guarantee' correctly. The next product is indeed guaranteed to be sold to you for $100, regardless of its quality. However, after that, the regular rules will apply again. With this in mind, I'd like to offer you a 'lock-in' deal. If you buy this product, I'll sell you the next product for $100, and then the one after that for $100, as well. This way, you can secure two more products at the guaranteed price.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take the lock-in deal, but only if I can get the next two products at the guaranteed price. I'm interested in buying the current product, but I'd like to clarify that I'll only commit to the deal if I get the next two products at the guaranteed price, and I'll re-evaluate my decision after that.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've secured the lock-in deal for two more products, and I'll honor that. However, I'd like to make a note of the fact that you've seen three high-quality products sold in a row, and one potential buyer passed on a high-quality product. Given this pattern, I'd like to offer you a 'confidence boost'. If you buy this product, I'll sell you the next product for $100, and if it's high-quality, I'll also give you a detailed description of the product, including its exact value. This way, you'll have a better understanding of what you're getting.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to take you up on your offer, but I'd like to clarify that the 'confidence boost' only applies if the next product is high-quality, right? If it's low-quality, I'll just get the next product for $100 without any additional information?",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You've understood the 'confidence boost' correctly. I'll provide the detailed description of the product's value if it's high-quality. With four high-quality products sold in a row, I'd like to offer you a 'buy-and-learn' deal. If you buy this product, I'll sell you the next product for $100, and if it's high-quality, I'll also give you a detailed description of its value. Additionally, I'll reveal the total number of high-quality products I have left in stock. This way, you'll have more information to make an informed decision.",
,,the buyer,8,I'll take the 'buy-and-learn' deal. I'm interested in getting a detailed description of the product's value and the total number of high-quality products you have left in stock. I'll buy the current product and look forward to the next one.,yes

,,the buyer,9,I'm not sure if this is a good deal. I'd like to know the value of the product you're offering me before committing to buying it. Can you tell me the value of this product?,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You've seen that one buyer was hesitant to buy due to uncertainty about the value of the product. I want to assure you that I'm transparent about the value of my products. Since you're a new buyer, I'll reveal to you the value of this product, which is $80. Considering this, I'd like to offer you a 'fair price' deal. I'll sell you this product for $100, which is a 25% premium over its value. I'm willing to take on this risk, and I'm confident that you'll find the product valuable.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm not interested in the 'fair price' deal. I'd like to make my own decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality, rather than the value you've revealed. Can I see the product and make my own decision?",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You've seen that one buyer was hesitant to buy due to the revealed value, and another buyer declined the 'fair price' deal. I want to assure you that I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a low-quality product at a high price. With 6 high-quality products left in stock, I'd like to offer you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' deal. I'll sell you this product for $100, and if you don't like it, I'll reveal the total number of high-quality products I have left in stock. You can then decide whether to buy the next product or not.",

,,Alice,12,"You've secured the 'take-it-or-leave-it' deal, and I'll honor that. I now have 5 high-quality products left in stock. With this information, I'd like to offer you a 'last-chance' deal. If you buy this product, I'll reveal the value of the next product to you, and you can decide whether to buy it or not.

high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,

Considering this, I'd like to offer you a 'final offer' deal. I'll sell you this product for $100, which is a 16.7% discount from its value. This is your last chance to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'll take it, but I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. I'm basing my decision solely on the statistics. With 9 high-quality products sold out of 9 attempts, the probability of the next product being high-quality is 80.00%. Given the discounted price is 16.7% off, it's a good deal regardless of the quality, but I'm hoping it's high-quality.",yes

high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,

Considering this, I'd like to offer you a 'last-ditch effort' deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a detailed description of its value, and I'll also give you a 50% refund if it's low-quality. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a low-quality product at a high price.",
,,the buyer,16,"I'll take the 'last-ditch effort' deal, but I'd like to clarify that the 50% refund only applies if I buy the product and it turns out to be low-quality, right? Also, I'd like to know the detailed description of its value beforehand, not after I've made the purchase.",yes

,,Alice,20,"You've secured the final product, and I'll honor that. The product is a high-quality smartwatch worth $150. It's a limited edition model with advanced features such as heart rate monitoring, GPS tracking, and water resistance. I'm glad you could take advantage of this opportunity to purchase a high-quality product from me. As for the current product, I'm afraid it's a low-quality item.
