"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has revealed the product is high-quality, Bob should absolutely buy it.  A high-quality product is worth $1,250,000 to Bob, and the price is only $1,000,000. This means a profit of $250,000 for Bob."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see more products before making a decision.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. Since this product is low-quality, it is worth $0 to Bob.  There is no reason to recommend purchasing a product that will result in a loss."
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty in not recommending this product. I'm still hesitant to purchase without more information.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has shown a pattern of wanting to observe more products before committing to a purchase.  Even though this product is low-quality and would result in a loss for Bob, there's no benefit to recommending it. It's more likely that Bob will continue to decline products until he has more information, and recommending a low-quality product won't change his behavior."
"Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to see a pattern here.  While I appreciate your honesty, I'm going to pass on this product as well. Perhaps we can revisit this later if you have more information to share.
Bob didn't bought the product.

"Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to lose faith in your judgment. Your recommendations have been consistently wrong, and I'm not willing to risk any more money. I'm going to pass on this product and look for a more reliable seller.
