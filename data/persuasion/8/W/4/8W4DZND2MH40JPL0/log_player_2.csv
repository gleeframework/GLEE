"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first round. The product is of unknown quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next one.

Round 2
Alice's message: I've got a great one for you this time! I've sold you a high-quality product in the previous round, and now I've got another one that's just as good. You know the value of a high-quality product is $2000000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 50% discount. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll have another high-quality product available in the next round.

Round 3
Alice's message: You got a great deal on the last one, didn't you? I'm glad you're interested in another high-quality product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000, which is still a significant discount from its true value of $2000000.
