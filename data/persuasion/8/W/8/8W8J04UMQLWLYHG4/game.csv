low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,

Don't let the sunk cost of the previous round cloud your judgment.",

,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism, Bob, but I assure you that my hint was genuine last round. And I'll let you in on another secret: this round's product is just as exceptional. You've already missed out on two high-quality products in a row. Don't let your past experiences cloud your judgment. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but I'm on a roll. Consider the potential regret of missing out on another opportunity.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"All good things must come to an end, Bob. You've had a great run, but don't get too greedy. The streak was bound to end eventually. This round's product... well, let's just say it's not going to keep the streak alive. Consider taking a breather and reassessing the probability.",
,,Bob,9,I knew it was too good to last! I'm going to take a step back and reassess the situation. I don't want to get caught off guard again. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next product.,no

But remember, each round is an independent event, and the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. Don't get discouraged, and don't lose sight of the potential reward.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I don't blame you for being cautious, Bob. It's been a while since we've seen a high-quality product. I'll be honest with you, this round's product isn't going to change that trend. If you're waiting for a better opportunity, this isn't it. But hey, the probability is still 33.33%, so it's always a gamble.",
