high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice may be biased towards recommending low-quality products, so I'd rather not take the risk."
