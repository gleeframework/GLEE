,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product worth $4000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you say?",

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're excited about the deal! However, I want to be transparent with you. I've noticed that the previous two products were high-quality, and I'm concerned that you might be getting a bit too optimistic about the odds. This next product is actually a bit of a riskier bet. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that the value of this product is uncertain. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll give you a chance to buy it.",

,,Alice,4,"No worries at all, Bob! I completely understand your caution. In fact, I'm glad you're being rational about the risks. Given that you've already seen two high-quality products in a row, it's not unreasonable to be skeptical. This next product is actually another high-quality one, but I want to make it clear that the odds are not in your favor. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - you're taking a risk. If you're feeling bold, I'll give you the chance to buy it.",

,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your approach, Bob. You're being cautious and waiting for a more predictable opportunity. I respect that. In light of that, I'm willing to make a special offer on this next high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $800000, which is a significant discount from the market value. I'm confident that this is a deal you won't find elsewhere, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you at a lower price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, you've certainly piqued my interest with this offer. While I'm still cautious, the price reduction is significant and makes this a much more attractive deal.  Let's do this.",yes

What do you say?",

I'm not hiding anything, and I'm not making any promises. You know the odds, and you know the risks. If you're feeling lucky, I'll give you the chance to buy it.",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, I appreciate your transparency. You've been generous with the last few deals, but I'm going to pass on this one. The full price makes this a risk I'm not willing to take at the moment. Let's see how the next few rounds play out.",no
