,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a risk-taker!"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would be a good deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not going to buy it based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the quality of the product, please."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't find a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'd like to wait for a recommendation from Alice for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm thinking that the probability of the product being high-quality is still quite high, and the potential gain is worth the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, none of the previous buyers bought a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product to see if it's a low-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to ask, what is the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? And how many products have been offered in total?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high quality is 33.33%, which is the same as the overall probability. Given the lack of information, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100, which is worth $0 to me."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your previous recommendations and the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not risk buying a potentially low-quality product for $100, considering its value to me is only $0."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data and your recommendation. Can you provide that?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations and the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm suspicious that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd rather pass on this product to avoid a potential loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. Since none of the previous buyers bought the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
