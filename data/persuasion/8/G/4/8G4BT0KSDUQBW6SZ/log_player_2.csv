Alice's message: I'm happy to provide you with that information! The 60% probability I mentioned earlier is indeed based on Bayes' theorem. With 3 out of 5 products being high-quality, the prior probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. After observing that 2 out of 3 products sold to previous buyers were high-quality, the posterior probability of a product being high-quality given that it was sold to a buyer is 60%. As for the first product, I can reveal that it was indeed a high-quality product. Now, I'd like to offer you this exceptional product, knowing that the chances of it being high-quality are high.
