high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the fact that you recommend it makes it more likely to be a low-quality product, given the current statistics."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm assuming that your recommendations are based on the product's quality, so if you don't recommend it, it's likely to be a low-quality product. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 33.33%.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the products sold so far are likely low-quality.
