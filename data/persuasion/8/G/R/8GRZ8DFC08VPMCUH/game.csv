,,Alice,1,yes,

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, I don't have any information to go by yet, so I'll just have to rely on the random chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there are no high-quality products sold yet, and she's trying to get me to buy a low-quality product. I'll wait for more information."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're recommending me not to. Is there something specific you've observed in the previous sales that led you to make this recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is against it, and I think there's a good chance it might be a high-quality product"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like all the previous buyers received low-quality products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you provide me with the probability of the product being high-quality given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases so far? And also, what's your reasoning behind not recommending the product? Is it because of the low-quality products sold so far or is it something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products were sold, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended not to buy to 3 other buyers, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at the fixed price of $10000."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that the high-quality products have been sold to previous buyers. Given that none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products recommended to buy were likely low-quality. Therefore, I will pass on the current product, as it's more likely to be low-quality."
