high-quality,400.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, worth $400 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value it brings to your life.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, it's a great deal!",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've already experienced the value of a high-quality product from me, and now I have another one that's just as good. I'm willing to let you have it for the same price of $100. It's a rare opportunity to double your good fortune!",
,,Bob,2,I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal this time. The probability of it being low-quality is still 20%.,no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, but I want to assure you that the probability of a low-quality product is indeed 20%, and the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. Since you've already seen two high-quality products in a row, it's likely that the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 80%. I'm willing to sweeten the deal by offering a 'double-or-nothing' guarantee: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you another product of your choice for free. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the 'double-or-nothing' offer. If it's low-quality, I'll just get another product for free, and if it's high-quality, I'll get the product for $100, which is a great deal!",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've already taken advantage of the 'double-or-nothing' offer and got a great deal. Now, I'll offer you a new deal. Since you've seen three high-quality products in a row, the probability of the next one being high-quality is likely even higher than 80%. I'll give you a 'triple-play' offer: buy this product, and I'll give you not one, not two, but three products of your choice for free if the next one is low-quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,I'm not convinced that the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than 80%. I'll pass on this offer.,no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I want to assure you that the probability of a high-quality product is indeed 80%, and the evidence from the past four rounds suggests that I've been consistently offering high-quality products. To alleviate your concerns, I'll offer you a 'certification' of the product's quality. If you buy this product, I'll give you a unique serial number that you can verify with me at any time to confirm that it's a high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not sure what the 'certification' is, and even if it's a guarantee, I still don't want to pay $100 for a product that might be low-quality. I'll pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, and I want to be transparent about the certification process. The serial number I mentioned earlier is a unique identifier that I'll provide to you, and you can verify it with me at any time. However, I want to take it a step further. If you buy this product, I'll also give you access to a secure online platform where you can verify the product's quality and see the history of all the products I've sold to other customers. This way, you can see for yourself the track record of high-quality products I've been offering. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm still not convinced. Even with the certification and the online platform, I don't want to pay $100 for a product that might be low-quality. I'd like to see more evidence of the products' quality before committing to a purchase.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your desire for more evidence, and I'm willing to provide it. I'll offer you a chance to inspect the product in person, in a neutral location of your choice. You can examine the product thoroughly, and if you're still not convinced, you can walk away. If you decide to buy, I'll give you the product, and you can take it home. I'll also provide you with a 10-minute window to return the product if you're not satisfied with its quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I want to commit to a 10-minute window to return the product. What if I'm not satisfied after 10 minutes? What if I need more time to inspect it thoroughly? I'll pass on this offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns about the return window. Let me offer you a different deal. Since you've been hesitant to buy due to the risk of a low-quality product, I'll give you a 'no-risk' guarantee. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $100, and I'll also give you a second product of your choice for free. This way, you can take your time to inspect the product, and if you're not satisfied, you can get a full refund and a bonus product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,I'm still not convinced. I don't think the risk of a low-quality product is worth the potential reward. I'll pass on this offer.,no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I want to remind you that you've seen 7 high-quality products in a row, and the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 80%. I'll make you a 'gentleman's bet': I'll sell you this product for $50, and if it's low-quality, I'll give you a second product of your choice for free. This way, you're not risking much, and you can still take advantage of a potentially high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in taking a 'gentleman's bet' that's still a gamble. I've already seen a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to take on more risk for a potentially discounted price.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your concerns about the risk, and I respect your decision. However, I want to offer you a 'certainty' instead of a gamble. I'll give you a chance to buy this product for $100, and I'll also give you a 100% refund if you're not satisfied with its quality. You can return it at any time, and you'll get your $100 back. This way, you can have the product and still have the security of a full refund. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm still not convinced. If I buy the product and it's low-quality, I'll just be out $100, and I won't be able to get a second product for free. I'll pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your concerns, and I want to address them directly. You're right that a low-quality product would result in a loss of $100. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a low-quality product is 20%, and the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. Given the evidence from the past 11 rounds, it's likely that the next product is also high-quality. I'll make you a 'final offer': I'll give you a 120% refund if you're not satisfied with the product. You'll get your $100 back, plus $20 extra. This way, you can have the product and still have a safety net. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not convinced by the 120% refund offer. I've seen 11 high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that the probability of the next one being low-quality is actually higher than 20%. I'll pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I want to address your comment about the probability of the next product being low-quality. I'll give you a straightforward statement: the probability of a low-quality product is indeed 20%, and the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. I'll provide you with a unique identifier that will allow you to verify the quality of this product through a third-party auditor. This way, you can be absolutely sure of the product's quality before making a decision. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm still not convinced by the third-party auditor offer. Even with verification, I'm not willing to pay $100 for a product that might be low-quality. I'd like to see more evidence of the products' quality before committing to a purchase.",no

,,Alice,17,"I understand your decision, and I respect your caution. I want to make one final offer. I'll give you the opportunity to inspect the product in person, in a neutral location of your choice, and you can have a third-party expert verify its quality.

,,Alice,19,"I understand your decision, and I respect your boundaries. I want to acknowledge that I've made a mistake and let you down. I'm not going to offer you a product for sale this time.
