Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the buyer in round 1 bought the product and didn't have any information about the product's quality, they must have been willing to pay at least $100,000 to take the risk. This means that the minimum value of the product to this buyer is $100,000. 

Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and the buyer knows this, they will only buy if they expect the product to be worth at least $100,000. 

Since this product is high-quality, I will recommend the buyer to buy it.
