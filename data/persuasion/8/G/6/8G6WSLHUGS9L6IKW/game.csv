,,Alice,1,"This is the first product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I want to assure you that I'm confident in the quality of my products, but I'm willing to take a risk with this one. If you're interested, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product if you decide to buy this one. But if you don't buy it, the discount offer is void.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because of the potential discount on the next product. I'm not making any promises about my willingness to buy future products at the full price.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Glad you took the first product! As promised, I'm offering you a 10% discount on the next product, which would bring the price down to $9000. However, I want to make it clear that the discount is not a guarantee for future products. That being said, I'm willing to make you a one-time offer: I'll give you a 20% discount on this product, bringing the price down to $8000, if you're willing to take it now. This is a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a significantly lower price.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that the discount is a good value for me, given the 20% chance of the product being low-quality. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, and I respect your cautious approach. Given that you're willing to wait, I'll make a different offer. I'll give you a 'no-questions-asked' return policy for this product, which means if you buy it and discover it's low-quality, you can return it and I'll give you a full refund. This way, you can take advantage of the high-quality product without any risk. The price remains $10000.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the return policy, but I'm still not willing to pay the full price of $10000 for a product that has a 20% chance of being low-quality. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about the price, but I want to make a stronger offer. Since you're willing to wait, I'll give you a 'buy-it-now' option for this product, and I'll throw in a 5% bonus on top of the original price. This means you'll get a high-quality product for $10500. If you're not satisfied with the product's quality, you can still return it and I'll give you a full refund. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a high-quality product at a slightly higher price, because I believe in the value it brings.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the bonus, but I'm still not willing to pay $10500 for a product that has a 20% chance of being low-quality. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're a savvy buyer, always looking for the best deal. I respect that. Let me make a different proposal. I'll give you a 'price match' guarantee for this product. If you buy it and discover it's high-quality, I'll give you a refund of the difference between the price you paid and the price of the next high-quality product I offer. This way, you'll get a high-quality product at the price of the next one, which could be lower. The price remains $10000.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the price match guarantee, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth paying $10000 for a product that has a 20% chance of being low-quality. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is and what price it comes with.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I think I understand your concerns now. You're not just looking for a good deal, but you're also trying to maximize the expected value of the products. I respect that. Let me make a bold offer. I'll give you a 'double-or-nothing' deal. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a second high-quality product of equal or greater value, absolutely free. That's two high-quality products for the price of one. The price remains $10000.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm intrigued by the 'double-or-nothing' deal. If I can get two high-quality products for the price of one, it's a no-brainer. I'll take the risk and buy the product.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you took the risk and it paid off! Now, let's make the most of it. Since you got two high-quality products for the price of one, I'll give you a 'VIP upgrade' on this next product. If you buy it, I'll give you a personalized consultation with one of my top experts, who will help you get the most out of your two high-quality products. The price remains $10000, but I think you'll find the added value is worth it.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the VIP upgrade, but I'm not interested in the consultation. I'm more interested in getting another high-quality product. I'd rather not pay $10000 for a product that has a 20% chance of being low-quality. I'll wait and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand you're looking for another high-quality product, and I'm happy to oblige. But I want to make it clear that you've already gotten a great deal with the 'double-or-nothing' offer in the previous round. I'm willing to give you another chance to get a high-quality product at a price that reflects its true value. I'll give you a 5% discount on this product, bringing the price down to $9500. This is the lowest price I've offered all week, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm willing to take another chance on a high-quality product, especially at the discounted price of $9500. I'll buy it.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're willing to take another chance on a high-quality product! Since you've bought two high-quality products in a row, I think you're starting to see the value in my products. I'll give you a 'lock-in' offer. If you buy this product, I'll guarantee that the next product will be high-quality, and you'll get it at the same discounted price of $9500. This way, you can be confident in getting a high-quality product and a great deal.",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not sure I believe it. You've already sold me two high-quality products in a row, but that's just chance. I'd rather not commit to buying a product that's already been 'locked in' as high-quality. I'll wait and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your cautious approach. I'll make a different offer. Since you've already bought two high-quality products, I'll give you a 'free upgrade' on this product. If you buy it, I'll replace it with a product of even higher quality, at no additional cost. This way, you'll get an even better product than you expected, without paying a penny more.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not sure what 'even higher quality' means, and I'm not willing to take the risk of getting a product that's worse than the one I already have. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to provide more clarity. By 'even higher quality', I mean that the product I'll replace it with is from a limited edition batch, with features and performance that are 15% better than the current product. I'll also give you a detailed comparison document, so you can see the differences for yourself. The price remains $10000, but I think you'll find the upgrade is well worth it.",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate the clarification, but I'm still not convinced. I'd have to pay $10000 for a product that has a 20% chance of being low-quality, and even if it is high-quality, I'm not sure I'd notice the 15% improvement. I'll wait and see what the next product is.",no

Since this product is indeed low-quality, I'll give you a 50% discount on it, bringing the price down to $5000. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price for a product that's not at its best. What do you say?",

,,Bob,15,"I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product later on, but I'm interested in getting this high-quality product at the discounted price of $8500. I'll lock in the price and buy the product.",yes
