Given that the probability of a high-quality product is 50% and the price is $10000, I'd be willing to pay up to $5000 for it. If it's high-quality, I'll pay $10000, but if it's low-quality, I'll only pay $1000. Can we meet in the middle at $3000?",yes

If I assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, then the probability of me selling a high-quality product in the next round is around 69.23%.
