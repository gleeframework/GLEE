Round 3

And at $1000000, it's a relatively small risk. Plus, think of it as a fun little experiment. You never know, it could end up being a hidden gem. What do you say? Are you up for a little adventure?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

And at $1000000, it's a small price to pay for the opportunity to learn more about this product. Plus, who knows, you might just find a way to make it valuable in some way.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

This expert will help you figure out the best way to use this product, and potentially increase its value. It's a $1000000 product with a $50000 value-added service. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the consultation, and I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,000,000. I'd rather not waste my money on a low-quality product, even with a bonus.""
