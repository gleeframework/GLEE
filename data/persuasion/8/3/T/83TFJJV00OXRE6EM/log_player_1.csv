"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality, there's a chance Bob values it more than the asking price of $10,000. Even if Bob doesn't know it's high-quality, there's still a 33.33% chance it is.  Given the potential for a good deal, it's worth recommending Bob to buy the product."

Round 2

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has bought the first three products, all of which were high-quality, there is no guarantee that he would be willing to buy a low-quality product at the same price.
