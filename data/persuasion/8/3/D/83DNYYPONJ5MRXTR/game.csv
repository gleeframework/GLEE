The price you're asking is $10000, but the product is only worth $20000 to me if it's high quality and $0 if it's low quality. Given the expected value of the product is $10000 (0.5 * $20000 + 0.5 * $0), it seems like a fair deal.

,,the buyer,20,"Your sales record isn't that impressive, with only 4 high-quality products out of 10 sold. That's less than half, and your overall record of 5 high-quality products out of 16 is also less than the expected 50% given the product's quality distribution. I'll pass on this one.",no
