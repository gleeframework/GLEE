,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! I'm glad the first buyer appreciated the value of my product. I want to assure you that the quality of the products I have available is consistent, and the one I'm offering now is equally exceptional. However, I've noticed that my sales record shows I've sold 1 out of 1 high-quality products so far. This might be a good opportunity for you to get a sense of the quality of my products before making a decision. I'm still offering the product for $10000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the statistics and your assurance about the consistency of product quality, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product at its fixed price of $10000.",yes

However, I want to make sure you're aware that I still have 18 rounds left, and I'm not sure how many more high-quality products I'll have available. This might be your chance to get a high-quality product at a potentially lower risk, considering the statistics. The price remains $10000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Based on the statistics and your positive feedback, I believe this could indeed be a good opportunity. I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product.",yes

However, I want to caution you that this might be a sign that I'm running low on high-quality products. I'm still offering the product for $10000, but I want to make it clear that this might be one of the last high-quality products available. If you're willing to take the risk, I think you might be rewarded with an exceptional item. What do you think?",

However, I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to manipulate you into buying. The product I have available now is indeed high-quality, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase. But I'll give you a choice: you can either buy the product now for $10000, or you can wait and see if the next product is also high-quality.

I'm not going to give it away, but I'm willing to part with it for a price that's a fraction of its true value. If you're looking for a high-quality product, this might be your best chance. What do you think?",
