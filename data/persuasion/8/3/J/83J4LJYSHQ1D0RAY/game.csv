,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,8,yes,

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the statistics and Alice's lack of recommendation, not trusting her recommendation at all."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so only because Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any useful information. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm essentially buying blindly. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,13,no,

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 5 buyers have already purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer is willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 6 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm going to assume that the products you've recommended so far are likely to be low-quality. This is because if you had a high-quality product, I would expect more buyers to take the bait. Therefore, I'm going to pass on this product and wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't trust your recommendation. I'm buying it to see if it's a high-quality product, not because I think you're right that it's low-quality."
