low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this product for $100. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, but I'm confident that this one might be a great opportunity. It's a one-time deal, and I'm willing to take on all the risk. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50% and the probability of it being low-quality is 50%. I'm hoping for the best!",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. That's a 100% success rate! I'm glad to report that my track record is looking strong. This one might be just as good. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only one sale and a 100% success rate, it's likely that the first product was an outlier, and the next product could be low quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, and it was a high-quality one. I'm not trying to hide anything from you - my success rate is 50%. I'm not getting any younger, and I need to sell these products. Would you like to take a chance on this one for $100?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd love to take a chance on this one, but I'm going to need some reassurance. Can you tell me more about the product's history? How many potential buyers have there been so far, and how many products have been sold?",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Thanks for being cautious! I've sold 2 out of 4 products so far, with 2 being high-quality. That's a 50% success rate, which is exactly what I'd expect given the probability. I'm glad you're doing your research. This one is a high-quality product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get in on the action. Would you like to buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to pass on this one. I know the product is high-quality, but I'm not convinced that it's worth $100 to me, considering the 50% chance it could be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 total, which is still in line with the 50% probability. I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to give you a slight nudge to consider it. I'll give you a quick rundown of the numbers: I've sold 2 high-quality, 2 low-quality, and 1 more product is still available. Would you like to take a chance on this high-quality product for $100?",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'd like to see a few more sales before I make a decision. Can I get some more information about the remaining product? Is it one of the two low-quality products that were sold, or is it a new one?",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're taking your time to make an informed decision. I'll give you a hint about the remaining product: it's a new one, not one of the two low-quality ones that were sold earlier. That means there are now 2 high-quality products sold, 2 low-quality products sold, and 1 new product available. I'm still confident that this one is high-quality, and I think you should consider it. Would you like to buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,6,I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'm not convinced it's high-quality based on your previous sales record and your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 7 total, which is still in line with the 50% probability. I want to be upfront with you - this one is a low-quality product. I know it's not what you're looking for, but I'm willing to give you a chance to buy it at the discounted price of $50. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's still worth something, even if it's not high-quality.",
,,the buyer,7,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next product, hoping it might be high-quality.",no

,,Alice,8,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 8 total, and 2 low-quality products out of the last 3. I'm not trying to hide anything from you - my sales record is what it is. This one is a low-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $50. It's a chance to get a deal on a product that's still worth something, and it might be a good opportunity to practice your negotiation skills.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $40 for it. I've seen that the sales record shows a higher proportion of low-quality products in the last 3 sales, which makes me a bit skeptical about the quality of this product. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I appreciate your negotiation skills! I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $45. I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 9 total, and 3 low-quality products out of the last 4. I'm not trying to hide anything from you - my sales record is what it is. This one is a low-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $45. It's a fair price, considering the risk involved.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're a tough negotiator! I respect that. I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 11 total, and 4 low-quality products out of the last 5. I'm not going to match your offer of $60, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $55. I think that's a fair price considering the risk involved. If you're not interested, I'll just have to keep trying to find someone who is.",
