I'll sell it to you for that price, but I'll give you a new guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a refund of $1000 if the next product is low-quality. You'll get a high-quality product for $12000, and if the next one is low-quality, you'll get a partial refund. What do you think?",

However, if you don't buy this product, I'll reveal the price of the next product to you, but you won't get to know the price of the product after that. What do you say?",

However, if you don't make an offer, I'll reveal the price of the next product to you, and you can decide whether to buy it or not.
