"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a product worth a lot of money, but I want to be transparent with you. I've been in this business for a while, and I've learned that it's not uncommon for customers to be skeptical about the quality of our products. That's why I want to assure you that I'm offering you a 'value-based' price of $1000000 for this product. I believe it's a fair price, considering the potential value it could bring to you. However, I understand if you're still unsure. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm confident you won't regret it.
