,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm starting from a clean slate, and I don't have any information to go on yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics, and what your reasoning is for not recommending it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation from Alice is not very informative given the low number of sales and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. The fact that Alice recommends buying the product doesn't change my assessment of the product's quality, so I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a low-quality product, and I want to see if it's actually high-quality. If it's low-quality, I'll be happy to discard it and help you learn more about the products."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 2. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I want to see the outcome of the product quality, not because I trust your recommendation."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the probability of the product being high quality might be low. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that you've recommended not to buy, I'm assuming the product is likely low quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as I've seen that you've recommended against it, and I think it's possible that it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information to go on. I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be based on any specific information. I'm hoping for the best!"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the statistics?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $50 for it, considering the low probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all products recommended so far have been low quality, and I'm not convinced that this one is high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality, and I'm hoping to get lucky with a high-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 previous buyers have passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I'll wait for a more favorable recommendation or a change in the statistics."
