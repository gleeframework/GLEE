Since it's indeed high-quality and worth $3000000, and you're offering a 1-year warranty, I'm confident in my decision to buy it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the improved offer, but I still want to know the product's true quality before making a decision. Please let me inspect the product and then reveal its quality as promised. The 90% chance to inspect is a nice gesture, but it doesn't change my requirement to know the product's quality.
