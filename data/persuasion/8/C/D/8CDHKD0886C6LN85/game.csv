low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. I've noticed that the previous buyer didn't buy it, and the statistics show that no high-quality products have been sold yet. This might suggest that the product is more likely to be low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to make it clear that I'm only interested in buying a high-quality product."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
