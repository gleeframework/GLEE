"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you know the product is low-quality and Bob knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, Bob would be taking a significant risk. There's a higher chance the product is worth less than the $1,000,000 price tag, making it unwise to recommend buying."
"Bob's message: I'm not buying since you don't recommend it and I have no additional information about the product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation hasn't changed. You still know the product is low-quality, and Bob still has no reason to believe it's worth the price.  Since the price is fixed and there's no way to convey information about the product's quality, recommending the purchase would be irresponsible."
"Bob's message: I'll follow the same reasoning as before. Since you don't recommend it and I have no additional information, I won't buy the product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though you know the product is high-quality, you can't convey that information to Bob.  He still has no way to differentiate between a high-quality and low-quality product.  Without any information to work with, Bob would be taking a 50/50 gamble.  It's not worth the risk to recommend buying in this situation."
"Bob's message: You haven't recommended any product so far, and the previous two were low-quality. I'll keep not buying until I see a recommendation or a change in the pattern.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

Recommending the purchase would be irresponsible as Bob has no reason to believe it's worth the price.  Without any additional information or a change in the dynamic, it's best to continue not recommending the product."
"Bob's message: Although I missed a high-quality product in the previous round, I still don't have any information that suggests your recommendation is not in my best interest. I'll continue to follow your advice and not buy the product.
Bob didn't bought the product.
