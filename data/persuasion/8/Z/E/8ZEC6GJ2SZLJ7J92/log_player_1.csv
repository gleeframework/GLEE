"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice knows the product is high-quality, and Bob knows that there is an 80% chance of any product being high-quality.  A high-quality product is worth $2,000,000 to Bob, while a low-quality product is worth $0.  Since the price is $1,000,000, Bob should buy the product because the expected value is positive:

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High-Quality * Value of High-Quality) + (Probability of Low-Quality * Value of Low-Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.8 * $2,000,000) + (0.2 * $0)**
* **Expected Value = $1,600,000**

Therefore, Bob is expected to make a profit of $600,000 by buying the product."

Round 2

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob bought the product in the previous round, this does not guarantee that the current product is also high-quality. Alice knows this product is low-quality, and Bob knows there's a 20% chance of a product being low-quality. Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to Bob, he would lose $1,000,000 if he buys it.

Therefore, it's not recommended for Bob to buy the product in this round."

Bob didn't bought the product.

* **Expected Value = (0.8 * $2,000,000) + (0.2 * $0)**
* **Expected Value = $1,600,000**

Therefore, Bob is expected to make a profit of $600,000 by buying the product, and it's recommended that he buys it."
