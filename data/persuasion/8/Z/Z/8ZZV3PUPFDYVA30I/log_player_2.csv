So, out of 2 products sold, 1 was high-quality and 1 was low-quality. I've now sold 2 products in total, and I'm eager to offer you the next one for $1000000.

Alice's message: You are correct that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. I appreciate your attention to detail. Let me offer you a different perspective. If I were selling only high-quality products, I would have sold 3 high-quality products by now. Since I've only sold 2 high-quality products, it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality.

I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll offer you a second product at the same price of $1000000. If the second product is also high-quality, I'll offer you a third product at the same price.

Alice's message: I completely understand your need to think carefully about your decision. I appreciate your attention to detail and your willingness to consider the probability of a high-quality product. As you weigh your options, I'd like to offer you a simple proposition: if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to inspect it before paying the full price of $1000000. If it's high-quality, you can pay the full amount. If it's low-quality, I'll refund your payment in full. This way, you'll have a chance to verify the quality of the product before making a commitment.

Alice's message: I understand your calculation of the expected value and your skepticism about the products. I'd like to acknowledge that the lack of high-quality products sold so far does suggest that the probability of a low-quality product might be higher than 50%.
