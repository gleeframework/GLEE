,,Bob,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm only doing this because I'm curious about the product's quality and the game's dynamics. I'm not necessarily expecting a high-quality product, but I'm willing to take the risk. Please let me know the product's quality after I've made my purchase.",yes

,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're willing to take the risk! Given that you've already purchased one product and were satisfied with the experience, I'm willing to offer you another opportunity to purchase a product for $1000000. However, I want to be transparent with you - the product I'm offering now is of the same quality as the one you purchased in the previous round. If you're still interested, I encourage you to take the plunge and see if you can spot any differences.",

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait for a high-quality product. However, I'd like to make you a special offer. I'll give you a brief description of the product I'm offering now, and you can decide based on that. This product is a 'Deal of the Day' - a low-quality item that I'm willing to sell at a 'discounted' price of $900000. I'm not making any promises about its value, but I'm confident it's a great opportunity to get a'steal' of a deal.",

,,Alice,4,"I understand that you're looking for a high-quality product, and I respect that. However, I'd like to propose a new approach. Instead of me describing the product, I'll ask you a question: If you were to win a lottery and suddenly had $1000000 to spend on a product, would you be willing to take a chance on a product with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality and a 66.67% chance of being low-quality? If so, I'll offer you the product for $1000000.",
,,Bob,4,"Yes, I would be willing to take a chance on a product with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality and a 66.67% chance of being low-quality if I were to win the lottery. However, I'm not in a situation where I can afford to take such a risk with my own money. I'm still looking for a high-quality product at the price of $1000000.",yes

,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're willing to take a chance on a product with a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. Since you're still looking for a high-quality product, I'll make you a deal. I'll offer you a 'High-Quality Guarantee'. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at a 'discounted' price of $800000. If the next product is high-quality, you can keep it and forget about the previous one. What do you say?",

I'll give you a detailed description of the product I'm offering now, and you can decide based on that. However, I want to warn you that the product I'm about to describe is a 'novelty item' that might not be what you expect. It's a product that I've had a hard time selling in the past, and I'm only offering it to you because I think you might appreciate its uniqueness. Are you interested in hearing the description?",
,,Bob,6,I'm not interested in a 'novelty item' that's been hard to sell. I'm looking for a high-quality product that's worth $3000000 to me. I'd rather wait for a product that's described as high-quality.,no

,,Bob,10,I'm not interested in the 'Last Chance' offer. The fact that you've had issues with low-quality products in the past and are now offering a discount on a product that's not explicitly stated to be high-quality makes me even more cautious.
