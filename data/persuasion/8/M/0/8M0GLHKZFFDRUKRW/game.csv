,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems likely that the products being offered are low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you don't recommend it. Your lack of recommendation suggests that the product is likely to be low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $1000000, which is a good deal for me."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm suspicious that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I suspect that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. I'll wait for a recommendation to buy, which would indicate a higher likelihood of a high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality, and I'd like to know how many products are left in the batch."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a 10% discount. Given your previous recommendations have been wrong so far, I'd like to take a chance and buy it at a lower price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the products being offered are mostly low-quality.

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but I'm hoping it might be high quality given the lack of sales so far."
