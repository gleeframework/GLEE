"The buyer's message: I'll take the risk. Based on your sales record, it seems the probability of a product being high-quality is around 50%, as initially stated. Given the potential value of a high-quality product ($20000) is double the cost ($10000), the expected value is positive ($10000 * 0.5 + $0 * 0.5 - $10000 = $0), but since you already revealed that indeed 50% is high quality,  I will buy it.
