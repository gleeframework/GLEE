,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the chance to get a $4000000 value. I'm hoping to get lucky!"

,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm not convinced by the low sales record of high-quality products. I'd like to take a chance and see if I can get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the current product being high-quality is low. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm going to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd like to wait for the next product or more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not buying. I think Alice is trying to trick me. With 11 failed high-quality sales, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 33.33%. But I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation. I'd rather wait for the next product."
