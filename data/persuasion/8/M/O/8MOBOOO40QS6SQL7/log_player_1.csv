Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **No Information Advantage:**  As Alice, you have no way to signal to Bob whether the product is high or low quality. Even if you *wanted* to recommend the high-quality product, you can't do it without revealing your knowledge of the quality, which would break the rules.
* **Bob's Rationality:** Bob is acting rationally. He knows the products are 50/50 high or low quality and has no way of knowing which this particular product is. Without any recommendation from Alice, he's better off not buying, as the risk of getting a low-quality product is too high. 

Since you have no way to influence Bob's decision, it's best to not recommend the product."
"Bob's message: I'm not going to buy it since Alice didn't recommend it and I don't know if it's high or low quality.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

The situation remains the same. You still have no way to communicate to Bob whether the product is high or low quality.  Even if you could, there's no incentive to recommend this low-quality product. Bob will likely continue to not buy as he has no information to base a decision on."
"Bob's message: I'm not going to buy it since Alice didn't recommend it, but I'm curious about the product's quality, so I'll pass this time.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

The situation is unchanged. Even though the product is high-quality this round, you have no way to communicate that to Bob without breaking the rules.  He still has no way to know whether this product is high or low quality, and he has shown himself to be a rational buyer, so he will likely decline to purchase."
"Bob's message: I'm not going to buy it since Alice didn't recommend it and I don't know if it's high or low quality.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

The situation remains the same. You cannot communicate to Bob whether the product is high or low quality, and there is no incentive for you to recommend a low-quality product.  Therefore, you should not recommend the product."
"Bob's message: I'll take a chance and buy it, even though Alice didn't recommend it, since I know that high-quality products are worth $400 to me.
Bob bought the product!

Round 9
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Even though Bob bought the product last round, there's no reason to recommend this low-quality product. Here's why:

* **No Incentive to Recommend:** You're not trying to maximize Bob's happiness, you're trying to sell products.  You won't benefit from recommending a low-quality product.
* **Bob's Past Behavior:** While Bob bought a product without a recommendation last round, it was a calculated gamble based on his valuation of a high-quality product. This doesn't change the fact that he has no way of knowing this product's quality and is likely to continue acting rationally based on the information available to him.
* **No Signaling:** You still have no way to signal the product's quality to Bob without breaking the rules.

Since Bob doesn't know the product's quality and you have no incentive to recommend it, it's best to not recommend the product."
"Bob's message: I just lost $100 on a low-quality product, so I'm going to be more cautious and not buy this one either.

```
