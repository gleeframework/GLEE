"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $125 to you if it's high quality and $0 if it's low quality, and Alice knows this, her recommendation is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.  While there's still a 20% chance it's low quality, the potential reward outweighs the risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads up, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she knows the value of the product to you, her lack of recommendation implies a high likelihood of it being low quality.  It's not worth the risk of losing $100."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take a chance on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's recommendation is not as strong as in Round 1 (since we now know she can be wrong), it still holds significant weight. We have seen that she is not just randomly recommending products. Her knowledge about the product's quality, combined with her recommendation, makes it more likely (80%) to be high quality. The potential reward of $25 outweighs the risk of losing $100."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a positive signal. We've now seen her be correct twice in a row when recommending a product. Her track record makes it more likely that the current product is high quality. The potential reward of $25 still outweighs the risk of losing $100."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.
