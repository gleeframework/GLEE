Alice's message: Welcome to our store! We've had a great response from our customers so far, and we're excited to offer you our next product. As you may know, 50% of our products are high-quality, but the other 50% are still great values in their own right.

Would you like to take a chance and see what you get?

Alice's message: Ahah, a savvy buyer! We love customers who do their own math. You're right, the 50/50 chance is a key consideration.

Alice's message: Great question about the sales record! We're actually still investigating why we've had a higher proportion of high-quality products sold so far. It could be due to a variety of factors, such as our suppliers having a good batch of high-quality products recently or our sales team being more effective at identifying high-quality products. We're working to identify the root cause and make adjustments as needed. In the meantime, we're still offering this product to you for $100, with the same 50/50 chance of it being high-quality or low-quality. Would you like to take the chance and see what you get?
