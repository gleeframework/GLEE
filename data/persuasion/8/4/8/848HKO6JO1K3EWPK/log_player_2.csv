``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on.  
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has a strong incentive to sell high-quality products, as that means she'll get more sales.
* **Positive Signal:** The fact that one high-quality product was sold already is a positive signal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $40,000 outweighs the potential loss of $10,000.

**Important Note:** This is a gamble, and there's no guarantee of a good outcome. However, the limited information available suggests taking the risk is a reasonable strategy."
