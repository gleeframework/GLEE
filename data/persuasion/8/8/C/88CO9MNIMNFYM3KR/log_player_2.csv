"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is offering the product at $100 and a high-quality product is worth $120 to you, it's always beneficial to buy.  Even though there's a 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk."

Round 2

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take another one! Thanks for the recommendation.""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic from Round 1 applies. As long as Alice is offering products at a fixed price of $100, and a high-quality product is worth $120, it's always beneficial to buy regardless of past outcomes. The chance of a low-quality product doesn't change the fact that the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk."

```
