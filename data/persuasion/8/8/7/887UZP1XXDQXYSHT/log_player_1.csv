Since the product is low-quality, there's no reason to recommend it. The buyer has no information about the product and would be taking a 50/50 risk. It's better to not recommend the purchase."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **The buyer has no information about this specific product.** They only know the general 50/50 chance of any product being high-quality.
* **The buyer is risk-averse.** They bought the first product even though they had no information, demonstrating a willingness to gamble. 
* **You know this product is high-quality.**  This is your chance to capitalize on the buyer's risk-taking nature. 

While the buyer might not pay $1,000,000 for a low-quality product, they are likely to be willing to pay that much for a high-quality product, especially given their willingness to buy the first product with no information."

* **The previous buyer's rejection provides information.**  Even though the buyer didn't know the quality of the product, their refusal to buy after your recommendation signals that they're more cautious than the first buyer. 
* **You know this product is low-quality.**  There's no reason to risk alienating this potential buyer with a recommendation for a product you know to be inferior. 
* **Building trust is crucial.**  You're in a situation where you need to gain the buyer's trust to make future sales. It's better to avoid a negative experience with a low-quality product that could damage your credibility."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

```

Here's why:

* **You have no information about this buyer's risk tolerance.** They could be like the first buyer, willing to gamble, or like the second and third buyers, more cautious. 
* **You know the product is high-quality.** This is a good opportunity to test the waters with a buyer who may be open to a deal, especially since you don't have much data yet.
* **A rejection doesn't hurt you in this situation.**  You're not risking much by recommending a high-quality product. If they refuse, it doesn't damage your credibility as it would if you recommended a low-quality product.

This approach allows you to gather information about the buyer's decision-making process, which will be valuable in future rounds."

* **Risk of Negative Feedback:** Recommending a low-quality product could lead to a negative experience for the buyer, potentially resulting in bad reviews or word-of-mouth that could hurt your future sales.
