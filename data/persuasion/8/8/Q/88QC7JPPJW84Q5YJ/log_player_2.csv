With 4 high-quality products out of 7 sold, the probability of the next product being high-quality is indeed higher than 33.33%. However, it's worth noting that the last two products in a row have been low-quality. This might indicate that the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than 40%.

Alice's message: You're a risk-taker, and I respect that! However, I want to give you a more detailed breakdown of the numbers. With 4 high-quality products out of 8 sold, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still higher than 33.33%. But, if we look at the last three products in a row, all of which were low-quality, it's possible that we're experiencing a temporary dip in the quality of the products. I'm offering this product to you at the same price of $1000000, and I think it's worth considering the potential for a high-quality product to follow the low-quality streak.
