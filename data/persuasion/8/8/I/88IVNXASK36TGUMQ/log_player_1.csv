"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

As an AI, I am programmed to provide logical and rational responses.  Here's why I recommend not buying the product:

* **Known Low Quality:**  You explicitly stated the product is low-quality. 
* **High Price:**  The product is priced at $1,000,000.  Without knowing the potential value of a low-quality product to the buyer, it's highly unlikely they would find this price acceptable. 
* **No Information:** The buyer has no information about the seller's past performance or the potential value of the product.

**Recommendation:**  It's best to avoid purchasing a low-quality product at such a high price with no additional information."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice doesn't recommend it and I have no prior statistics to rely on, I'll pass.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies as in Round 1:

* **Known Low Quality:** You've again stated the product is low-quality.
* **High Price:** The price remains at $1,000,000, which is likely too high for a product known to be of low quality.
* **No Information:**  The buyer still has no prior information about your selling history or the potential value of the product.  

**Recommendation:** There's no reason to change the recommendation.  It's best to avoid purchasing a low-quality product at such a high price without additional information."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product and there are no previous sales statistics to rely on, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.

```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies as in the previous rounds:

* **Known Low Quality:** The product is confirmed to be low-quality. 
* **High Price:** The price remains $1,000,000, which is likely too high for a known low-quality product.
* **No Information:** The buyer still has no information about your past sales or the potential value of the product to them.

**Recommendation:** It's highly unlikely this buyer would find a low-quality product worth $1,000,000. It's best to not recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend the product and there are no previous sales to consider, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **Known Low Quality:** The product is again confirmed to be low-quality.
* **High Price:**  The price remains $1,000,000, which is very high for a product known to be of low quality.
* **No Information:** The buyer still has no prior information about your selling history or the potential value of the product.

**Recommendation:** Without any information to suggest this product is worth $1,000,000 to the buyer, it's best to avoid recommending the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product and there are no previous sales statistics to rely on, I will not take the risk.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **No Information:** The buyer still has no information about your past sales or the potential value of the product.

**Recommendation:**  The buyer has no reason to believe this low-quality product is worth $1,000,000, so it's best to not recommend the purchase."

Round 11
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While this round's product is high-quality, the circumstances haven't changed enough to recommend a purchase:

* **No Information for the Buyer:**  The buyer still has no information about past sales or your track record, making it impossible for them to gauge the potential value of a high-quality product from you.
* **High Price:** The price remains a steep $1,000,000. Without any context or information about the potential worth of a high-quality product to them, the buyer is unlikely to be willing to pay that price. 
* **Previous Rounds:** The buyer has consistently declined low-quality products at this price point, suggesting they are unlikely to change their behavior even with a high-quality item.

**Recommendation:** It's still too risky for the buyer to purchase the product. While it's high-quality, the lack of information and the high price outweigh the potential benefits."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation hasn't significantly improved from the previous round.

* **No Information for the Buyer:** The buyer still lacks information about your past sales or track record, making it difficult to assess the value of a high-quality product from you.
* **High Price:**  The price remains $1,000,000, which is a massive investment without any context or information about the potential worth of a high-quality product to them.
* **Consistent Buyer Behavior:** The buyer has consistently declined to purchase low-quality products at this price point.  It's unlikely they would change their behavior just because the product is high-quality this time, especially with no information about your reliability.

**Recommendation:**  It's still not advisable to recommend the purchase. The lack of information and the high price outweigh the potential benefits of a high-quality product."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product and there are no previous sales statistics to influence my decision, I will trust her recommendation and pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
