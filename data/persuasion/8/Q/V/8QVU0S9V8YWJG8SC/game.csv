,,Alice,2,"I've got a high-quality product this time, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the usual price of $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. Trust me, it's worth every penny!",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take it, but I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I'm buying it because of its 33.33% chance of being high-quality, not because I trust your opinion.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've got a product that's a bit of a mystery, and I'm not even sure what it is. It might be a high-quality product, or it might be a low-quality product.

If it's low-quality, you'll only lose $100. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the 'double or nothing' option. I'll buy the product and hope it's high-quality. The potential reward of getting another high-quality product for free is too good to pass up, and the risk of losing $100 is manageable.",yes

What do you say?",
