Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're considering buying from me. Since you're new, I'll give you some context: I've sold 1 product so far, and it was a low-quality one. This means that 2 out of 3 products I've sold were low-quality. I'm offering this one for $10000. Would you like to take a chance?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, given the statistics that 0 high-quality products have been sold and the product you sold was low-quality, combined with the 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality, I've decided not to take the risk this time. I'll pass on this offer and wait for more information about future products.""}"
