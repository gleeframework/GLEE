"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As an AI, I cannot recommend a specific action based on human emotions or the desire to maximize profit. However, here's the logic:

* **High-Quality Product:** The product in this round is confirmed to be high-quality.
* **Buyer's Knowledge:** The buyer knows there's an 80% chance of a product being high-quality.
* **No Information on Buyer's Valuation:**  We don't know how much the buyer values a high-quality product, so we can't say for sure if it's worth $1,000,000 to them.

**Therefore, it's reasonable to recommend the buyer to buy the product.** There's a high probability it aligns with their expectations, and they are aware of the risks involved."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first sale and there's no data to suggest otherwise, I'm willing to take a chance based on the 80% chance of a high-quality product and your recommendation. Let's do it!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Low-Quality Product:** The product in this round is confirmed to be low-quality.
* **Buyer's Lack of Information:** The buyer has no information about the specific product's quality and only has the knowledge of the overall 80% high-quality probability.
* **No Data on Previous Sale:** The buyer is unaware of the previous sale where a high-quality product was sold, and there's no reason to believe this round's product will be high-quality. 

**Therefore, it's not recommended to recommend the buyer to buy the product.**  The buyer has no reason to believe this is a good deal, and there's a high chance they will be disappointed with the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. I will pass on this product. I appreciate the information provided.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3

```

**Explanation:**

* **High-Quality Product:** This round's product is high-quality.
* **Buyer's Knowledge:** The buyer is aware of the 80% probability of a high-quality product.
* **Previous Sale Data:** While the buyer doesn't know the specific quality of the previous product, they know that one sale has happened, and one product was high-quality. This provides some positive signal, although it's not definitive.

**Therefore, it's reasonable to recommend the buyer to buy the product.** The buyer has no reason to believe this product is low-quality, and the previous sale data adds a slight positive bias."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation Alice!  I'm happy to take the product.  
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.
