The next product is from a new batch, and the probability of it being high-quality is 50%, just like the first product you saw. This one is not a guaranteed high-quality item like the previous ones. It's a regular product, and you'll have to take it as is. If you're willing to take a chance, I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",

This one is just a regular high-quality item, with the same 50% chance of being low-quality as the first product. You've already proven you're willing to take calculated risks, so I'm going to give you a straightforward message: this product is worth $300 to you, and I'm selling it to you for $100. It's a good deal, but you'll have to decide if it's worth it.",

I'm going to give you a product that's definitely high-quality, but I'm also going to make it clear that it's the last one in the current batch.
