,,Alice,1,"This is the first product, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a discount, considering the high-quality products are priced the same. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can finalize the sale.",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, given the 50/50 chance of the product being high or low quality, and the fact that I value a high-quality product at $1250000, I'm not comfortable taking the risk at this price point. I'd like to see a few more products before making a decision.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm glad you're being cautious. This next product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. I'm taking a risk by offering it at a lower price than its true value, which I'm confident is higher than $1250000. I'm giving you a chance to get a great deal on a top-notch product. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can finalize the sale.",
,,Bob,2,"Alice, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to take a risk. However, I still need more information to make a decision. While you believe the product is high-quality, I can't be certain based on your statement.  I'd like to see a few more products before committing to a purchase.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your need for more information, Bob. I'll give you a concrete example to help you make a decision. Let's say I offered you a high-quality product for $1250000, and you would have bought it. If I were to offer you the same product at $1000000, would you still not buy it? If not, it suggests that you value the product at more than $1250000, which means you're passing up a good deal. If you would buy it at $1000000, it implies that you value it at $1000000 or less. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. What's your decision?",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, your logic makes sense. Based on your example, I can see that your offer is indeed a good deal, even if I'm not certain about the quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy this product for $1000000.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you took the risk and made a smart decision, Bob! You've just bought a high-quality product at a great price. Now, let me offer you another product. Given that you valued the previous high-quality product at more than $1250000, I'm willing to offer this new high-quality product to you for $1200000. This is a premium price, but I'm confident that it's still a good deal considering the value you've demonstrated for high-quality products. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, I appreciate your confidence in the quality of this product. Based on my previous experience and your offer, I'm willing to purchase this product for $1200000. I believe the high quality justifies the price, especially considering the value I placed on the last product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're pleased with the previous purchases, Bob. However, I want to make it clear that this next product is not high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, which is the same price as the first product. I'm giving you a chance to get a low-quality product at a price that's lower than what you've paid for the high-quality products. Consider this as a 'discount' for a product that might not meet your expectations. What's your decision?",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, I appreciate you being upfront about the product's quality. However, based on my past experience and my valuation of a low-quality product at $0, I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for this product.  I'd like to see a few more products before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your decision, Bob. Given that you value a low-quality product at $0, I'm willing to offer you this low-quality product for $500000.

,,Bob,6,"Alice, while I appreciate your offer and the discount, I'm still not willing to pay for a product that I know is low quality and holds no value for me. I'd prefer to pass on this one.",no

I'll give you this low-quality product for $0, and you can take it home without paying a dime. It's a one-time offer, and I won't make any further discounts. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not interested in taking a low-quality product even for free. It would cost me more in terms of storage and potential disposal costs. I'd prefer to focus on high-quality products that offer actual value.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

,,Bob,8,"Alice, I appreciate your creative offer, but I'm not comfortable with the gamble. While the potential profit is high, the risk of losing $100000 is too much for me. I'm looking for more predictable investments and would prefer to pass on this offer.",no

I'll give you this low-quality product for $50000. This is a significantly lower price than the previous offers, and it's a chance for you to get a product at a deep discount. You can think of it as a 'clearance sale' price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not interested in purchasing another low-quality product. Even at a discounted price, it doesn't hold any value for me.
