Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You have no information about the buyer's preferences or the value they place on high-quality products.
* Since the product is high-quality, and you know the buyer is aware of the 80% probability of high-quality products, there's a strong chance they will find value in it.
* It's in your best interest to recommend the purchase to maximize your sales."

* However, the previous buyer's decision to decline, despite the slightly improved sales record, suggests they are very risk-averse and require more evidence before purchasing.
* Since this product is low-quality, recommending it would damage your reputation and potentially discourage future buyers.
* It's better to be honest with potential buyers and decline the recommendation to maintain trust and attract buyers who are comfortable with the inherent risk."
