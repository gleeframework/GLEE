**Explanation:**

* **Previous Data:** 7 buyers purchased, all 7 were high quality. This suggests a strong correlation between Alice's recommendations and high-quality products. 
* **Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying. 
* **Value Proposition:** Even though the product could be low quality, the odds are heavily in favor of it being high quality given the past data and Alice's recommendation. The potential gain ($300) outweighs the potential loss ($0)."
