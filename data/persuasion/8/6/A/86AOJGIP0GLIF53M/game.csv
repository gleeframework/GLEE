,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that if I buy and it's low quality, I'll be wasting $10000. Given that 4 previous buyers have also bought and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be even lower than 50%."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to see a few more sales before I consider buying."

,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm concerned that this might be a low-quality product.
