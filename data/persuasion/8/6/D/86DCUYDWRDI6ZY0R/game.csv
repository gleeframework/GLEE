low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since it's the first one and I don't have any information to go by."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 out of 2 products has been sold, and that product was low-quality, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm the 2nd buyer and the first buyer passed, which makes me more likely to get a high-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold out of the first two, it's likely that the products are low-quality, and I don't want to risk wasting my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, which is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low-quality. I don't want to risk buying a product that is not worth $100 to me."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not sure I should buy it based on your previous recommendations. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the products?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that there haven't been any high-quality products sold yet, and I think the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the probability might be low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if you have any information about my valuation, but I'm going to take a chance and buy it. I'm hoping that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold in the past 5 attempts, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 attempts, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%.
