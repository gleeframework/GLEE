Here's why:

* **The buyer has no information about the current product's quality.**  They only know the overall statistics, which show a 100% success rate so far.
* **Alice is motivated to maximize her profit.**  While she could try to build trust by recommending only high-quality products, she'll lose money if she doesn't sell. 

Therefore, Alice should continue recommending the product, hoping the buyer will buy it despite the risk."
"The buyer's message: I'll take my chances. The statistics show 100% of the products sold were high-quality, and Alice recommends buying this one. The probability of the product being high-quality, combined with Alice's recommendation, is enough to convince me to make the purchase.
