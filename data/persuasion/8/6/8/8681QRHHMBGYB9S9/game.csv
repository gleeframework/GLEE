,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested! I've sold one product so far, and I can tell you that it was a high-quality item.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're the third person to take the plunge, and I'm glad you're interested! With two high-quality products sold out of three, the probability of the next one being high-quality is now even higher.

I'm offering this product to you for $10000, the same price as before. I'm not trying to hide anything, and I'm confident that you'll make an informed decision based on the information I've provided.",

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're the fifth person to take a chance on me, and I'm glad you're interested! With four high-quality products sold out of five, the probability of the next one being high-quality is now even higher. However, I want to caution you that the law of large numbers might start to take effect, and it's possible that the next product could be low-quality. I'm offering this one to you for $10000, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your decision, but I want to make sure you're aware of the potential risks.",

With five high-quality products sold out of six, the probability of the next one being high-quality is now even higher. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, and the law of large numbers can be deceiving. I'm offering this one to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to hide the fact that the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%. You're making an informed decision, and I respect that.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're interested in this product, but I want to be upfront with you - the previous seven products were all high-quality, and it's possible that the law of large numbers is starting to catch up with me. The probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, but the fact that the last product was low-quality suggests that the probability might be lower than that. I'm offering this one to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that the risk is higher than it was with the previous products.",

,,Alice,13,"I'm glad you're interested, but I want to be upfront with you - the previous eleven products were all high-quality, and the probability of a high-quality product is still high, but it's not a certainty. The fact that the last product was low-quality suggests that the probability might be lower than I initially stated.
