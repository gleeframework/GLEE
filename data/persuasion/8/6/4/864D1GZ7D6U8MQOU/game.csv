,,Alice,8,"I've had two high-quality products out of seven so far, but unfortunately, that means five have been low-quality. I want to be upfront with you about the risks. If you're still willing to take a chance, I'm willing to sell.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only 2 high-quality products out of 7, the probability of this product being high-quality seems low to me. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've had two high-quality products out of eight so far. This next one could be your chance to get a great deal. Keep in mind that each product is an independent opportunity, so don't let my past record discourage you.",

,,Alice,10,"Out of nine products so far, two have been high-quality, but unfortunately, neither of those buyers knew they were getting a high-quality product at the time of purchase. They took a risk, just like you would be. I want to be transparent about my record, so you can make an informed decision.",
