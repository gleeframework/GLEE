low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since it's the first one and I have no information to go on. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and make a profit."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the stated 33.33%. I'd like to negotiate a discount to reflect this risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm inclined to believe it's a low-quality product. Given the statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but with 2 failed attempts, the probability of a low-quality product is higher than 66.67%. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 buyers who received a recommendation to buy the product have done so, and none of the sold products were high-quality, I suspect that Alice may be recommending low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 3 products sold were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a new product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 3 products were high quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to see more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product, especially since I know the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that since 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, but I also know that each product has a 33.33% chance of being high quality. I'll take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests a higher proportion of low-quality products than expected, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, but I'm not sure if that's representative of the overall quality of the products. I'd like to take the chance and buy it."
