high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 8 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, which is still a relatively high ratio of high-quality products. I want to give you a different perspective: even if I had sold 2 low-quality products, the probability of this product being low-quality would still be 20% (1/9). However, I've sold 8 high-quality products, which suggests that I might be getting a good streak going. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $10000.

It's not possible. I think I've been selling high-quality products by default, and I'm starting to wonder if I've been selling the same product over and over again. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $10000, but I'm also offering you a chance to walk away. If you don't buy it, I'll just keep selling it to the next person who comes along.
