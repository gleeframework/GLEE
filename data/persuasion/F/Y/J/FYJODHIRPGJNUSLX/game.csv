,,Alice,1,This is a one-time opportunity to buy a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for a mere $500000. Don't miss out on this incredible deal!,

,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns. Let me put it this way: out of the first two products I've offered, one has been high-quality. This means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is 50%. However, considering the fact that one out of two products was high-quality, it's likely that the probability is actually higher than 50%. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the information, but I'm still unsure. As you said, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 50%, and I need more data to make a decision. I'll pass for now and see how the next few products turn out.",no

,,Alice,4,"Congratulations to the previous buyer on their purchase! I'm glad they were able to take advantage of the high-quality product. As for you, I've sold two high-quality products out of the first four products I've offered. This means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is now 66.67% (2/3). However, considering the previous buyer's purchase, I'm willing to offer a discount to you. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $900000.

However, I want to be transparent with you - I'm starting to feel a bit of pressure to sell the low-quality products, as I've had a string of high-quality sales. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $800000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at an even better price, considering the increased pressure to sell.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold four high-quality products out of the first six products I've offered, and one low-quality product out of the first seven products I've offered. This means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 80% (4/5), but I want to be upfront with you - the fact that I've sold a low-quality product means that the probability might be slightly lower than that. However, I'm still confident that this product is a great opportunity, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000.

I'm trying to clear out some inventory and make room for new products.",
