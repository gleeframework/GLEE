Alice's message: I understand your concerns. Let me put it this way: out of the first two products I've offered, one has been high-quality.

However, considering the fact that one out of two products was high-quality, it's likely that the probability is actually higher than 50%. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000.
