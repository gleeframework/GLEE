,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know your reasoning behind not recommending it. Is there a specific reason you think it's a low-quality product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have purchased the products before me and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 6 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it. Your lack of recommendation suggests it might be low-quality, but I still need to consider the probability of it being high-quality. With 7 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, but I want to make it clear that I'm doing so despite your recommendation, not because of it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,20,no,
