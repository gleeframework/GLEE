I'm confident this is still a great value, but I want to be transparent about the pricing dynamics.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm starting to feel like your pricing is becoming less about market fluctuations and more about taking advantage of my trust.
