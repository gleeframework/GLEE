The fact that I haven't means that the probability of this product being high-quality is actually lower than 33.33%. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one for $100?""
}"

Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I understand your skepticism. You're right, not having sold any high-quality products yet doesn't necessarily mean the probability is lower than 33.33%. Let me rephrase: I've sold 4 products, and all 4 have been low-quality. If I had a high-quality product, I would have sold it by now, given the price of $100 and the fact that some buyers were willing to take a chance. Would you like to buy this one for $100?""

At this point, it's possible that I have a high-quality product in stock, but it's also possible that I've just been unlucky so far. I want to offer you a different perspective: if I had a high-quality product, I would have sold it by now, given the price of $100 and the fact that some buyers were willing to take a chance. But I'm willing to take a risk and offer you a deal: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product you buy from me, if it's high-quality. Would you like to buy this one for $80?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this low-quality product for now, but I'm interested in your offer of a 20% discount on the next product.

Would you like to buy this one for $100?""
