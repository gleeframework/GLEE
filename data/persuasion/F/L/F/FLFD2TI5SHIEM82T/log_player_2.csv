Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you liked the first product! This one is also high-quality, but I need to be honest with you, I've already sold one product at a discounted price, so I'm not getting the usual profit margin.

Round 3
Alice's message: I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchases! However, I need to be upfront with you about this one. I've had a bit of a run of bad luck, and this product is unfortunately not as good as the previous ones. I'm only asking $10000 for it, which is actually below my costs. I'm hoping you can help me out and take it off my hands.

I'm only asking $8000 for it, which is below my costs, and I'm willing to throw in a 10% warranty on top of that. It's a risk, but it might be worth it if you're looking to flip it or use it for a specific project.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

I'm willing to let this one go for $7000, which is a significant loss for me. I'm not asking you to take a risk, I'm asking you to take pity on me and help me clear out some space. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

I'm willing to give you an even better deal on this one - I'll sell it to you for $6000, which is essentially a giveaway. I'm not making any profit on this one, and I'm starting to wonder if it's worth continuing to sell products at all. Please, consider this a last-ditch effort to get rid of this one and help me figure out my next steps.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
