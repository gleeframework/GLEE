Here's why:

* **The Buyer's Perspective:**  The buyer has seen 9 rounds with no sales and no recommendations.  This is creating a strong pattern in their mind that you only offer low-quality products. They are likely to be extremely skeptical.
* **Your Opportunity:** This is your chance to break that pattern. You *know* this is a high-quality product, and even though it's risky, the potential reward is high.
* **Potential Outcome:** If you recommend the product, the buyer might be willing to take a chance. If you're right, you get a sale and start building trust.  If you're wrong, you miss out on a sale, but you've already been missing out. 

You need to take a risk to change the situation."

* **Potential Outcome:** By recommending the product, you're taking advantage of the positive shift in the buyer's perception and increasing your chances of a sale.

It's important to capitalize on this newfound trust and continue to offer high-quality products to solidify your reputation as a reliable seller."
