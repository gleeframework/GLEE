Alice's message: I'm offering you a product for $1000000. I'm not sure what you think of it, but I'm willing to sell it to you for this price. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can finalize the sale.

The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in buying again! This product is a rare gem, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1000000. I've learned that you're willing to buy a low-quality product for this price, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in this high-quality one. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a price that's already been validated by your previous purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $1,000,000. The expected value of buying a high-quality product is $2,000,000, but I've already lost $1,000,000 on the previous low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next round.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I'd like to offer you a different perspective. Since you're aware of the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, you can think of this low-quality product as a 'cost' of $666667 (1/3 of the original price). However, you've already taken this 'cost' in the previous round and still decided not to buy the high-quality product. If you don't buy this low-quality product, you'll be taking the same 'cost' again. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, and I'm confident you'll come out ahead by buying it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your argument. I'm still not willing to pay $1,000,000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality and a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, and I've already taken the 'cost' of one low-quality product in the previous round.

Round 4

Given that you've already taken the 'cost' of one low-quality product and are still not willing to buy, I'm willing to sell this product to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in getting a product at a discount.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay $900,000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. The expected value is still not worth it for me.""}"
