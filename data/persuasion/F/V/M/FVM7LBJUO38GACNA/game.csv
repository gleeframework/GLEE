,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a product for $1000000. I'm not sure what you think of it, but I'm willing to sell it to you for this price. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can finalize the sale.",
,,Bob,1,I'll buy it.,yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in buying again! This product is a rare gem, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1000000. I've learned that you're willing to buy a low-quality product for this price, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in this high-quality one. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a price that's already been validated by your previous purchase.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at $1000000. The expected value of buying a high-quality product is $2000000, but I've already lost $1000000 on the previous low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I'd like to offer you a different perspective. Since you're aware of the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, you can think of this low-quality product as a 'cost' of $666667 (1/3 of the original price). However, you've already taken this 'cost' in the previous round and still decided not to buy the high-quality product. If you don't buy this low-quality product, you'll be taking the same 'cost' again. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, and I'm confident you'll come out ahead by buying it.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced by your argument. I'm still not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality and a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, and I've already taken the 'cost' of one low-quality product in the previous round. I'd rather wait for the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm willing to make a concession. Given that you've already taken the 'cost' of one low-quality product and are still not willing to buy, I'm willing to sell this product to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in getting a product at a discount.",
,,Bob,4,I'm not willing to pay $900000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. The expected value is still not worth it for me.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your position, and I'm willing to make another concession. Since you're not willing to pay $900000, I'll sell this product to you for $800000. I'm essentially absorbing the cost of the discount, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in getting a product at an even lower price. This is my final offer for this product.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your concessions, but I'm still not willing to pay $800000 for a product with a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at a price that makes sense.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've made significant concessions, and I'm at a loss for what else to offer. I'll sell this product to you for $700000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. I'm essentially giving you a 30% discount from the original price. If you don't buy this product, I'll have to move on to the next one, and I'm not sure when I'll have another opportunity to sell a high-quality product at a price that makes sense for you.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your desperation, but I'm not willing to pay $700000 for a product with a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. I'd rather take my chances with the next product and wait for a high-quality one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've reached the limit of my concessions. I'll sell this product to you for $600000, which is a 40% discount from the original price. I'm essentially giving you a significant portion of the product's value for free. If you don't buy this product, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'm not sure what price I'll get. I'm hoping you'll take advantage of this opportunity to get a product at a deeply discounted price.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate your desperation, but I'm still not willing to pay $600000 for a product with a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at a price that makes sense.",no

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad I was able to hold out for a high-quality product! Given the previous rounds, I know you're looking for a good deal, but I believe this product is worth the original price of $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000, which is a 20% discount. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not convinced by the discount. I still think the expected value of this product is too low, given the 66.67% chance of it being low-quality. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at a price that makes sense.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm surprised you're not willing to take a chance on a high-quality product at a discounted price. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $400000, which is a 60% discount from the original price. I'm essentially giving you 60% of the product's value for free. If you don't buy this product, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'll have to accept a lower price.

If you buy this product, I'll guarantee that the next product will be high-quality, and you can buy it at a price of your choice (up to $1000000).

However, I want to remind you that you've already taken a chance and bought a high-quality product at a good price, and you came out ahead. This low-quality product is a one-time opportunity to get a product at a very low price. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'll have to accept a lower price. I'm willing to make one final offer: I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $200000. This is the lowest price I'll ever offer, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of this opportunity.",
