However, think of it as a 'warm-up' for the next product, which might be even better. I'm offering this one to you at the discounted price of $10,000, and if you're not satisfied, you can always come back to me for the next one.

""Bob, I know you've had a great run, but I want to remind you that not every product is a home run. This one might not be as valuable, but it's still a chance to get a great deal. Think of it as a 'breather' before the next big one. And who knows, you might be able to flip it or use it as a trade-in for something else.

""Bob, I understand your caution, but I want to assure you that this is an isolated incident. The previous low-quality product was just a one-time thing. This next product is a great opportunity to get back on track. Think of it as a'reset' button. I'm offering it to you at the same price of $10,000, and I'm confident it's worth much more to you.

However, I want to be upfront with you - I have a limited number of high-quality products left, and I'm not sure how many more I can offer. This next product is a crucial one, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer you another high-quality one after this.
