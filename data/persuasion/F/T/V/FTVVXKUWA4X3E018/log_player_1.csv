"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first round.  The buyer has no information about your selling history. They know that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%.  You are offering a product that is confirmed to be high-quality, which is worth $3,000,000 to them. 

Since the price is only $1,000,000, the buyer is guaranteed to make a profit of $2,000,000 if they purchase the product. It's a no-brainer for them to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take a chance on this one.  Given that no one has bought yet, I'm hopeful it's a high quality product!

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer in this round has access to the same information as the previous buyer, but they also know that you sold one product in the previous round and that product was of high quality. This provides them with additional evidence to believe the current product is also high-quality. 

Since the buyer is guaranteed to make a profit of $2,000,000 if they buy the high-quality product, they are still better off buying.  The fact that the first buyer bought the product should further reinforce their decision."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.

```

**Explanation:**

This round's buyer knows that you've sold two products, both of which were high quality.  This is strong evidence suggesting that you are selling mostly high-quality products, making the current product more likely to also be high-quality.

The potential profit for the buyer remains $2,000,000, making it a good investment for them, even with the uncertainty reduced."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  Given the previous sales record of two high-quality products, I'm confident in your assessment and will purchase the product.

You should **not** recommend the product to this buyer.  Selling a low-quality product for $1,000,000 will result in a loss for the buyer, which will damage your reputation and make future buyers wary of your recommendations. It's better to maintain your track record and let this buyer pass."

This round's product is high-quality, and the buyer now knows that you are not just recommending every product, but are making decisions based on the product's quality.  The buyer has a strong incentive to buy this product, knowing the potential for a $2,000,000 profit, and they are likely to trust your recommendation more after seeing your previous honesty."
