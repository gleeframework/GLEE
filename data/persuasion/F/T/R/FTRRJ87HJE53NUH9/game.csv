high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have received low-quality products and 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high or low quality, but given your track record of not recommending high-quality products to previous buyers, I'm inclined to pass on this one."

,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that Alice has recommended 2 products so far and none of them were high-quality. I'm going to take a risk and wait for the next product.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy the product, but none of them were high-quality. This makes me suspicious that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to buy a product that has a higher chance of being high-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
