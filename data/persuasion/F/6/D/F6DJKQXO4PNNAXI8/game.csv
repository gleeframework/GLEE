,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous products were high-quality. I'll wait for the next one."

,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales and the quality of the products that were sold? I'd like to understand the pattern or any insights you can provide.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on the fact that the first two buyers didn't find any high-quality products. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being selected might be lower than expected.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous two buyers passed on the products, and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be higher than 50%."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, given your track record of not recommending low-quality products."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and all of them were low-quality products, I suspect that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass on a product before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but based on your previous recommendations, I'm inclined to think it's low quality. I'll pass on it to see if the next buyer is more optimistic."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products (since no high-quality products have been sold), I'm going to assume that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'll pass and let the next buyer have a chance to make a decision."
