,,Alice,3,"I'm offering you a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. I'll let you in on a little secret: I have a similar product that I'm willing to sell to you for $750000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll find it to be a much better value than the previous two products. Would you like to take me up on this offer?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not sure if the discounted price is a good deal, considering the previous two products were also supposed to be high-quality but turned out to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one and wait for more information.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about the previous products, but I assure you that this one is genuine. To alleviate your doubts, I'm willing to provide you with a detailed report on the product's specifications, testing results, and certification from a reputable third-party organization. This will give you a clear understanding of the product's value and quality. I'm confident that once you see the evidence, you'll be convinced that this is a worthwhile investment.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still cautious. The fact that you're willing to provide a detailed report and certification suggests that you might be trying to convince me of the product's quality, rather than letting me make an informed decision based on its inherent value. I'll pass on this one.",no

This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll find the bundle to be a valuable addition to your collection.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in the bundle deal. I've already gotten a great deal on the previous product, and I'm not sure if the second product is worth the full price. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,7,"I understand your hesitation, but I want to assure you that this product is a standalone item that can bring significant value on its own.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! As for this new product, I want to offer you a different approach. Instead of a discounted price, I'll give you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, just like the first one you passed on. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next product. But if you do decide to buy it, I'll throw in a special bonus: I'll give you a personalized consultation to help you get the most out of the product.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in the bonus, and I'm starting to feel like you're trying to get me to buy the same product I passed on earlier. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, and I assure you that this is a different product. I'm offering you a unique opportunity to invest in a product that I've been holding back for a special buyer. This high-quality product has a specific use case that I think you'll find particularly valuable. I'm willing to provide you with a detailed explanation of the product's features and how it can be applied to your specific needs. Would you like to learn more?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in learning more about the product's features and use case. I'm starting to feel like you're trying to tailor the pitch to me, and I'm not convinced that the product is worth the price. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm not going to try to sell you on this product. I'm going to be upfront with you: this is a lower-end product that I've been trying to clear out. It's still a good product, but it's not as high-quality as the others. I'm willing to sell it to you for $500000, which is significantly lower than the usual price. I think it's a fair deal, and I'm willing to let it go at this price. But if you're not interested, I'll move on to the next product.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your decision, and I respect your standards. As for this product, I want to be upfront with you: it's not my best product. In fact, it's one of the lower-end items I have in stock. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250000, which is a very low price for a product of this quality. I'm not trying to make a profit on this one, I'm just trying to clear out some inventory. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not interested in a low-quality product, even at a low price. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm not going to sugarcoat it: this product is not good. I've already lowered the price twice, and I'm not going to do it again. I'll sell it to you for $100000, which is essentially giving it away. If you're not interested, I'll consider it a loss and move on to the next product. But if you're willing to take a chance, I'll throw in a 'get out of one free' clause: if you're not satisfied with this product, you can return it and I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked.",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the 'get out of one free' clause, but I'm not interested in a low-quality product, even at a very low price. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm not going to keep offering you low-quality products. I'm going to be honest with you: I've made a mistake in my inventory management, and I need to clear out these products as quickly as possible. I'll sell this one to you for $1, and I'll even throw in a small gift, a pen, as a token of apology for wasting your time. That's it. Take it or leave it.",
,,Bob,13,"I appreciate the apology, but I'm not interested in a low-quality product, even at a price of $1. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,15,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! As for this new product, I want to offer you a chance to invest in a rare and exclusive item. This high-quality product is one of a kind, and I'm only offering it to a select few. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'll throw in a unique experience: I'll personally deliver the product to you and provide a comprehensive walkthrough of its features and benefits. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I think you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous purchase! However, I want to be upfront with you about this product. I've already told you that I need to clear out my inventory, and this is one of the lower-end items I have left. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is not as good as the previous ones. I'll sell it to you for $1, and I'll even throw in the pen I offered earlier as a token of apology for wasting your time. That's it. Take it or leave it.",
,,Bob,16,"I'm not interested in another low-quality product, even at a price of $1. I've been burned too many times already. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I want to assure you that this product is different. It's one of the best I have in stock, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the regular price of $1000000. But I'll also throw in a 5-year warranty, which is twice the standard warranty for this product. This way, you can have peace of mind knowing that you're protected in case anything goes wrong. I'm confident that this product will meet your expectations.",
,,Bob,17,"I'm not convinced by the warranty. I've seen you offer 'guarantees' and 'warranties' before, only to find out that the product is still low-quality. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'm not going to try to sell you on this product. I'm going to be honest with you: this is the last low-quality item I have in stock, and I'm willing to give it away for free. Yes, you read that right - free. I just want to get it off my hands and move on. Take it, and consider it a gift.",
,,Bob,18,"I'm not interested in a low-quality product, even if it's free. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I'm not going to bother trying to sell you this product. I'm just going to acknowledge that it's a low-quality item and leave it at that. If you're not interested in taking it, I'll just put it aside and move on to the next product. No pressure, no sales pitch, no nothing.",
,,Bob,19,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not interested in a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Well, it's been a long day. I've run out of low-quality products to offer you, and I'm out of sales pitches. I think it's time for me to admit defeat. I've failed to sell you a low-quality product, and I'm impressed. Congratulations, Bob. You've won. I'll just pack up my things and go home now.",
,,Bob,20,Ha! I think I'll pass on this one. I'm not interested in buying a 'congratulations' message. I'm just glad I was able to outsmart you and avoid buying any low-quality products.,no
