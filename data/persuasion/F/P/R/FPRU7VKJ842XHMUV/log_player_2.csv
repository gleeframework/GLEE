**Explanation:**

* **The information is very positive:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high-quality. This strongly suggests that Alice is making accurate recommendations.
* **The risk is low:** Even if the product is low-quality (which is unlikely based on the sales record), you only lose $10,000. 
* **The potential reward is high:** If the product is high-quality, you gain $2,500.

Given the high probability of the product being high-quality and the relatively low risk, it's a good decision to buy."
