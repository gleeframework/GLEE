high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so with the understanding that this is a new product and I have no prior information to go on. I'm essentially making a blind bet. I'm aware that there's a 80% chance it's high quality and a 20% chance it's low quality."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data. Can I get more information about the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product? What was their decision-making process like?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it, and considering the low probability of a high-quality product (20%), I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products is 0.5. This is lower than the true proportion of high-quality products (0.8).
