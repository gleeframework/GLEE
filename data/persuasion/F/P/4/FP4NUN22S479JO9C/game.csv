high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I've sold 0 products so far, and I'm looking to make a profit. If you're interested, I can offer you a 50/50 chance of getting a great deal.",
,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the opportunity. Given the uncertainty and the potential for a high-quality product, I am willing to take the risk at the offered price.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. I'm glad you know that the previous product was high-quality. This product is also high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Given that the first product was high-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 50% (since the probability of the first product being high-quality was 50% and the probability of the second product being high-quality is independent). However, I'm willing to offer you a discount of 10% off the price, making it $900000, to reflect the increased confidence in the product's quality.",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, and I'm glad you know that. This product is also high-quality. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, the probability of two products being high-quality in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4. However, since I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, the probability of the third product being high-quality is now 2/3 (since the previous two products being high-quality increases the likelihood of the next one being high-quality). I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'll offer you a 20% discount if you're willing to take on the risk, making it $800000.",
,,the buyer,3,"I trust the statistics and your recent sales. Given the increased probability of this product being high-quality, I am willing to take the risk at $800000.",yes

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,

I'm hoping that you'll take advantage of this opportunity to buy a product at an even lower price, despite it being low-quality. Keep in mind that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000 if you're willing to take the risk.",
