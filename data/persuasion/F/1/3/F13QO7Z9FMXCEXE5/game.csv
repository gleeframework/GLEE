high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, I don't have any information about its quality and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not buying based on the recommendation, I'd like to see the actual quality of the product first."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, as there's no information to go on yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics. What's the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and chose to do so, but no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the first product was likely low quality. This increases my skepticism about the quality of the current product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and it's a 10000 dollar product. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'll take a chance and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product, I'm going to take a chance and pass on it. If all previous buyers had high-quality aversion, the proportion of high-quality products would be expected to be lower than 33.33%, which makes the product more likely to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, I'm concerned that the product is also low-quality and I don't want to buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product and no high-quality products were sold, I suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not buying this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I think the probability of this product being high quality is still quite low."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, it suggests a very low probability of the product being high-quality. I'd rather wait for a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and possibly get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure I trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product and why you're advising me not to buy it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my own assessment of the probability of it being high-quality, not based on your recommendation."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous sales record, it seems that all products sold so far have been low-quality. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
