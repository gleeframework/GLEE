**Explanation:**

* **The buyer is risk-neutral:**  The value of a high-quality product ($12,500) is significantly higher than the price ($10,000).  Even though the chance of getting a low-quality product is higher, the potential reward outweighs the risk.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which implies she believes it to be high-quality. While this could be a random chance, it's a positive signal.
* **Previous sales:** The fact that one high-quality product was already sold provides further evidence that Alice's recommendation is likely based on some information about the product's quality.

**Overall:** Based on the limited information available, the buyer has a higher chance of making a profit by buying the product."
