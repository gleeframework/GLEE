Alice should still recommend against buying the product.  Here's why:

* **No Trust:**  Bob has no reason to trust Alice. She's consistently recommended against buying products, even though there's a chance they could be high quality.  
* **Risk Aversion:** Bob is clearly risk-averse. He's not willing to take a chance on a product when the potential loss (buying a low-quality product) is so high.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Alice has information about the product's quality that Bob does not.  Until there's a reason to believe Alice's recommendations are reliable, Bob is right to be cautious. 

Alice needs to find a way to build trust or provide more information to convince Bob. Simply switching to recommending a high-quality product without addressing the underlying issue is unlikely to be successful."
"Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to feel like there's something you're not telling me.  Can you explain why you consistently recommend against these products?  I'm not willing to buy without understanding the situation better.
Bob didn't bought the product.
