"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first product. If you buy it, I'll give you a 50% chance of getting a $4000000 product, and a 50% chance of getting a $0 product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to potentially get a high-quality product at a discount from the expected value of $2000000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the risk and buy the product, it's a 50/50 shot at a $2,000,000 profit.""}"

The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: You just got a $0 product, which is what I expected. Since the probability of getting a high-quality product hasn't changed, the expected value of buying from me is still $2000000. However, I'm willing to offer you a discount for the next product. If you buy this one, I'll sell it to you for $900000. It's still a 50/50 shot at a $2000000 profit.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that the expected value is still $2,000,000. Since I've already lost $1,000,000 on the first product, I'd like to reassess the situation. With a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product, I'd expect to break even on average. However, I've already taken a loss, so I'd like to be cautious and pass on this offer.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3

This new product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Since you've seen the value of a high-quality product firsthand, I believe you'll appreciate the opportunity to add another one to your collection. Plus, the expected value of buying from me has increased to $3000000, considering the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm glad you're willing to sell the high-quality product for $1,000,000. Considering I've already lost $1,000,000 on the first product and didn't buy the second one, I'm in a position to break even on average if I buy this product. And if I get lucky, I'll make a $3,000,000 profit. I'll take the risk and buy the high-quality product.""}"

I know you've had a good run, but I want to remind you that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%. If you buy this one, you'll be able to add another $4000000 to your collection, but if you get a low-quality product, you'll be back to square one. It's a 50/50 shot, and I think you should consider it.

I know you've had a good run, but I want to remind you that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%. I'm willing to offer you a'rebound deal' on this product. If you buy it, I'll sell it to you for $800000. This is a 20% discount from the usual price, and I'm willing to take on more risk to get you back on track. It's still a 50/50 shot, but I think this is a good opportunity for you to recover from your last loss.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the'rebound deal', but I'm not convinced it's a good idea to buy another product at this point. I've already lost $1,000,000 on the fourth product, and I'm now $1,000,000 in the hole. I'd rather not take on more risk and try to break even on the next product.
