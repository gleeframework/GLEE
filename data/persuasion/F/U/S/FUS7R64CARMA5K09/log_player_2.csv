Alice's message: Let me do a quick calculation for you. I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 9 total products sold, which means I've sold 4 low-quality products. If we assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, we can use Bayes' theorem to update the probability based on the data. Given that 3 out of the last 4 buyers were satisfied, the probability of the current product being high-quality is approximately 61.5%.
