high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is 100%. This is unusually high and I suspect that the first product might have been a high-quality one, which makes me cautious. I'd rather wait for more data to make a more informed decision."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision, but based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"

,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. The fact that you know how much each product is worth to me and you're recommending me to buy a product that has a 20% chance of being low-quality, it seems like you're trying to take advantage of me.
