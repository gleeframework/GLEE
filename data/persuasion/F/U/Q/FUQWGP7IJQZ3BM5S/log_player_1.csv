"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take a chance on you, Alice. I'll buy the product, but I'm doing it more for the thrill of potentially getting a high-quality product than out of pity. I hope you'll turn your luck around and start selling high-quality products again.

I'm not even going to try to spin this one - it's a low-quality product, and you should probably just walk away. But hey, if you're feeling desperate or just want to see what kind of junk I'm peddling, be my guest. It's only $100, and you might get a good laugh out of it.""}"

I don't have any more products to sell. I think you must have gotten the wrong message. But if you're willing to take a chance on a former salesperson who's clearly lost her touch, I suppose I could offer you a... unique experience. You could buy the rights to my business, complete with all the low-quality products and questionable sales tactics. It's a steal at $100, and you'll get to be your own boss... of a failed business. What do you say?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not interested in buying your business, and I'm definitely not going to take a chance on a product that's probably low-quality. You're not even selling a product, you're selling a failed business! I think I'll pass on this 'unique experience'.
