I'd like to assure you that the probability of a product being high-quality remains 80%. With this new information, I can provide a more informed estimate of the probability of the next product being high-quality. I'd like to offer you a special deal: I'll give you a 95% confidence interval of the probability of the next product being high-quality.

Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products sold. Given the previous sales data, I can calculate the 95% confidence interval for the probability of a product being high-quality. The interval is approximately [0.64, 0.96]. This means that I'm 95% confident that the true probability of a product being high-quality lies between 64% and 96%. Keep in mind that this interval is wider than the true probability of 80% due to the small sample size. The price remains at $1000000. Would you like to take the risk?

Given this new information, I'd like to offer you a more nuanced perspective. The probability of the next product being high-quality is likely lower than 88%, but it's still a significant chance.
