low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it. This suggests that the product may be low-quality, which is consistent with the 50% chance of a low-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000, as the potential upside of getting a high-quality product for $3000000 is significant. I'd like to take the product and see if I get lucky!"
