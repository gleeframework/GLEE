low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality yet.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not going to take the risk. I don't know the quality of the product, and even if it's high quality, I can still get a high-quality product in the next round."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take the chance. I know that Alice doesn't recommend it, so it might be a low-quality product, which would be worth $0 to me. But if it's high-quality, it's worth $20000, so I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I'm not going to fall for it. I know Alice knows the product's quality and is recommending it, so it's likely to be a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a product that she doesn't recommend, which might be more likely to be high-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'm going to take the bait this time. Alice is recommending it, so it's likely to be high-quality, which would be worth $20000 to me. I'll take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"I'm not going to get too confident. I just got lucky last time, and Alice knows the product's quality. I'll pass and wait for another opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Alice doesn't recommend it, so it's more likely to be a low-quality product, which would be worth $0 to me. But if it's high-quality, it's worth $20000, and I'd rather take that risk than pass on a potentially valuable product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"I'm not going to fall for Alice's recommendation again. She knows the product's quality and is trying to sell it to me, so it's likely to be a low-quality product. I'll pass and wait for a product that she doesn't recommend."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"Same as before, Alice is recommending it, so it's likely to be a low-quality product. I'll pass and wait for another opportunity."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'll take the chance this time. Alice is recommending it, and I've already missed out on a high-quality product once, so I'll go for it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I'm not going to get too greedy. I just got lucky twice in a row, and Alice is recommending it again. I'll pass and wait for a product that she doesn't recommend, which might be more likely to be a low-quality product that I can avoid losing money on."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"I'm not going to fall for Alice's recommendation again. I've missed out on two high-quality products already, and I'm not going to take the risk of buying another one. I'll wait for a product that she doesn't recommend."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"Same pattern, same decision. Alice recommends it, so it's likely to be high-quality, but I'm not going to take the risk. I'll pass and wait for another opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Alice doesn't recommend it, so it's more likely to be a low-quality product, which would be worth $0 to me. But if it's high-quality, it's worth $20000, and I'd rather take that risk than pass on a potentially valuable product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"I've been burned twice by Alice's recommendations, and now I'm not going to fall for it again. I'll pass and wait for a product that she doesn't recommend."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Alice doesn't recommend it, so it's more likely to be a low-quality product, which would be worth $0 to me. But if it's high-quality, it's worth $20000, and I'd rather take that risk than pass on a potentially valuable product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,"I've been burned too many times by Alice's recommendations. I'm going to stick to my strategy of passing on products she recommends. I've lost $20000 so far on low-quality products, and I'm not going to risk losing more."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Alice doesn't recommend it, so it's more likely to be a low-quality product, which would be worth $0 to me. But if it's high-quality, it's worth $20000, and I'd rather take that risk than pass on a potentially valuable product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"I'm not going to fall for it. I've lost money on three low-quality products that Alice didn't recommend, and I'm not going to risk losing more. I'll stick to passing on products she recommends."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one. Alice doesn't recommend it, so it's more likely to be a low-quality product, which would be worth $0 to me. But if it's high-quality, it's worth $20000, and I'd rather take that risk than end the game without trying."
