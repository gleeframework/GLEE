,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a product for $100. I know it's a low-quality product, but I'm willing to take a loss on it. I'm doing this as a 'test' to gauge your willingness to buy from me. Please consider this a one-time offer. If you buy this product, I'll know you're willing to pay $100 for a low-quality product, which will help me in our future interactions.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your decision last round, and I respect it. However, I'd like to point out that you're passing on a 'test' product that I know is low-quality. If you had bought it, I would have known you're willing to pay $100 for a low-quality product. Since you're not willing to pay that price for a low-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee': if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% refund if it's indeed low-quality, which we both know it is. This way, you can take a risk-free chance to buy a product from me.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by the 'guarantee' offer. Even with a 50% refund, I'm still paying $50 for a product that's only worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for a chance to buy a high-quality product.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to make you a counteroffer. If you buy this low-quality product for $100, I'll give you a'veto' power on the next product I offer. If the next product is low-quality, you can choose to buy it for $0, essentially getting it for free. If the next product is high-quality, you can still choose to buy it for $100. This way, you're not losing anything by buying this low-quality product, and you're getting a chance to potentially get a high-quality product for free.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the low-quality product for $100, hoping to get a veto power on the next product. I'll take advantage of the potential to get a high-quality product for free if the next product is indeed high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Congratulations on making a smart decision last round! As promised, you now have the veto power on the next product. Since you're aware that the previous product was low-quality, and you've already exercised your veto power, I'll make you a straightforward offer: I'll give you a 20% discount on this product, bringing the price down to $80. You can buy this low-quality product for $80, or you can choose to veto it and wait for the next round.",

,,Alice,5,"Well done on exercising your veto power! Now, I have a high-quality product for you. Given that you've seen the previous low-quality products and have a veto power, I'm willing to make a concession. I'll offer you a price of $80 for this high-quality product. This is a significant discount from the original $100, and I'm doing this because I believe you've demonstrated a willingness to wait for a high-quality product. Please consider this a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll appreciate the value of this high-quality product.",

I've learned that you're willing to pay a premium for high-quality products, and I believe this one is worth it. You've already seen the value of a high-quality product firsthand, and I'm confident you'll appreciate this one just as much. What do you say?",
