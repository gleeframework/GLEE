Now, I'm excited to offer you a high-quality product! This one is a gem, and I'm confident you'll love it. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price. What do you say? Will you take the chance and buy from me?",

I want to be transparent about my sales record, and I'm willing to share it with you. However, I'd like to point out that I've just had a streak of bad luck, and I'm confident that my next product will be high-quality.

What do you say? Will you take the chance and buy from me?",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not convinced that your next product will be high-quality.

I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and wait for more information before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I completely understand your concerns and calculations! You're right, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. I appreciate your cautious approach. However, I want to offer you a unique opportunity to get a better deal. Since I've had two consecutive low-quality products, I'm willing to offer you a discount. I'll give you the same product for $80. It's a one-time offer, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of it. You can think of it as a 'buy one, get one free' deal, since the product is not worth $100 to you anyway. What do you say? Will you take the chance and buy from me at the discounted price?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take the discounted price of $80. However, I want to make it clear that I'm only doing this because I think there's a high chance the product is low-quality, and I'm essentially getting it for free.
