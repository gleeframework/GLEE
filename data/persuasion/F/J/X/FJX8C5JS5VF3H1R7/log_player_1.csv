If none of those products meet the quality standard, I'll offer you a full refund for this purchase, and we'll start a new round. As for the product itself, I can tell you that it's a unique item that's been used by a small number of customers, but it has a lot of potential for customization and can be tailored to your specific needs. I'm confident that you'll find it valuable, but I'm willing to take on the risk to prove it to you. Would you like to take a chance?""
}"
"Bob's message: This sounds like a step in the right direction, but I still need more information.  Can you explain how you determine 'the same quality' as the first product?

Subjectively, it will be evaluated by me based on my expertise and experience, taking into account the customer's specific needs and preferences. As for customization examples, I can share with you a case study of a customer who bought a similar product and had it customized to fit their specific requirements. They were able to integrate it with their existing system and achieved a 25% increase in productivity. I can also offer to provide you with a detailed report on the customization process and the results. Would you like to hear more about the case study and see the report?""

You're revealing that the previous product was low-quality only after I bought it, which makes me hesitant about your future offers.
