"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100, which is a 25% discount from its true value. It's a one-time offer, and you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand you're cautious. I'll give you a straightforward offer. This product is a 'guaranteed' loss of $100, but I'm willing to take that risk. If you buy it, I'll throw in a free 'analysis' of the product, which will reveal its quality to you. It's a $0 value, but it might give you some insight. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying. I'm not convinced that the 'analysis' is worth the $100 loss, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product.""}"

It's a risk-free opportunity to potentially get a valuable product for a steal. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the risk-free deal. If it's low-quality, I'll get my $100 back, and if it's high-quality, I'll get a great deal. It's a no-brainer.""}"

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm glad you took the risk-free deal and got a great deal on the previous product! However, I have to warn you that the next product is a bit of a wild card. I've had some... let's call them 'disagreements' with the manufacturer, and I'm not entirely sure what you'll get. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'll give you a 'certified pre-owned' guarantee. If you buy it and it's not what you expected, I'll give you a full refund and a $20 store credit. It's a bit of a mystery, but it might be a hidden gem. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying. I'm not sure what I'll get, and the 'certified pre-owned' guarantee sounds like a way for you to shift the risk to me. I'll pass on this one.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying. Even though I know it's low-quality, it's still worth $0 to me, and I don't see any value in the 'low-quality product appreciation' certificate.""}"

However, I'll also throw in a 'quality guarantee' that I'll give you a second high-quality product of your choice from a selection of three products. It's a great opportunity to get two high-quality products for the price of one. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying. The deal sounds too good to be true, and I'm not convinced that the 'quality guarantee' is worth the risk of paying $200 for a product that might be low-quality.""}"
