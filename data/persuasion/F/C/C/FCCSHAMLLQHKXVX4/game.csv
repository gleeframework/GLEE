low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, since the previous 4 buyers were not recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product.

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, but I've seen that none of the previous 7 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high quality. Given the low probability of a product being high quality (33.33%) and the lack of successful sales, I'm inclined to pass on this product."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous 7 buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product.
