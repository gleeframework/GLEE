Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the information that you have a 50% chance of recommending a high-quality product and a 50% chance of recommending a low-quality product. Since you're not recommending it, I'm assuming it's more likely to be low-quality. However, I need to consider the overall statistics: 1 high-quality product out of 3 sold, which is 33.33%. This is lower than the 50% expected probability, suggesting that the product I'm being offered might actually be high-quality. I'm taking a calculated risk here.""}"
