**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  There's only one previous sale, and it was a high-quality product. This is a very small sample size and doesn't provide a strong basis for decision-making.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying. Since she has no way of knowing the product's quality before revealing it, her recommendation is essentially a coin toss.  
* **Potential Value:**  Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential upside of $120 (if it's high quality) outweighs the risk of losing $100.

**This decision is a gamble, but the potential reward makes it worth taking in this situation.**"
