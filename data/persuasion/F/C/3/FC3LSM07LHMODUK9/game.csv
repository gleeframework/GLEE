low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. If you're not interested, I can offer you a chance to inspect the product before buying. Would you like to inspect it?",
,,Bob,1,I'll pass on the current product. I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product at any price.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,I understand your concerns about the previous product. This one is different. I'm offering it to you at the regular price of $10000. I'm confident that you'll find it to be a great value. Would you like to take a chance and purchase it?,
,,Bob,2,I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product with a 50% chance of being worth $12500 to me and a 50% chance of being worth $0. I'd rather wait for a recommendation from you to make a more informed decision.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns about the expected value. However, I'd like to offer you a recommendation: if you're willing to buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee that you'll get a refund of $2500 if it turns out to be low-quality. This way, you'll only pay $7500, and you'll be guaranteed to get at least that much value out of it, regardless of its quality. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not sure I'm convinced by the guarantee. If the product is low-quality, I'll get $0, and if it's high-quality, I'll get $12500. The guarantee only changes the worst-case scenario, but it doesn't change the expected value. I'd like to see more information before making a decision.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your point about the expected value. Let me offer you a different approach. I'll give you a 'lottery ticket' that allows you to buy this product at the regular price of $10000, but if it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you another chance to buy a product from the next round at the same price, without knowing its quality. This way, you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product, and if not, you'll have a second chance to buy another product at the same price. Would you like to take the lottery ticket?",
,,Bob,4,I'm not interested in the lottery ticket. I'd rather wait for the next round and see the quality of the product before making a decision.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand you'd like to wait until the next round. However, I'd like to offer you a special deal on this round's product. I'll give you a 'certification' that I'll reveal the quality of the product to you, but only after you've purchased it. This way, you'll know for sure whether it's high-quality or low-quality before making a decision. If it's high-quality, you'll get the full $12500 value, and if it's low-quality, you'll only pay $10000. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm willing to take the risk of buying the product, but only if I get to know its quality afterwards. If it's low-quality, I'll be out $1000, but if it's high-quality, I'll get a great deal. I'll take the certification offer.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you took advantage of the certification offer earlier! Unfortunately, this round's product is low-quality. I want to make sure you're aware of this before you make a decision. Given that you've already taken a risk on the previous product and it turned out to be high-quality, I'm willing to offer you a special deal on this round's product. If you buy it, I'll give you a $500 credit towards a future purchase. Would you like to take a chance on this product?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the credit offer, but I'm not willing to take on the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product or a better offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your caution. Given that you've already had a positive experience with the previous product, I want to make it clear that this round's product is indeed low-quality. I'm willing to let you have it for $5000, which is a significant discount from the regular price. This way, you'll be able to get a low-quality product at a low price, and you can still take advantage of the $500 credit I offered earlier. Would you like to take it?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product or explore other options.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your stance on low-quality products. However, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity. I'll give you a 'free' low-quality product, which you can keep or resell as you see fit. You won't have to pay the $10000, but you'll still get the product. If you're interested, I'll throw in the $500 credit I offered earlier, so you can use it towards a future high-quality product. Would you like to take the low-quality product and the credit?",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the low-quality product and the $500 credit. It's essentially a free product, and I can always resell it or dispose of it as I see fit. The credit is a nice bonus, and I'll keep it in mind for future purchases.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you took advantage of the offer! Now that you have the low-quality product and the $500 credit, I'd like to make a new offer. Since you've already got a low-quality product, I'll give you a special deal on this round's product. I'll give you a 20% discount on the regular price, making it $8000. Additionally, I'll throw in a 10% chance of getting a high-quality product, which is worth $12500 to you. Would you like to take the discounted price and the added chance of getting a high-quality product?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not sure I understand the 10% chance of getting a high-quality product. If I buy the product, I'll either get a high-quality product or a low-quality product, but the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50% regardless of the discount. I'd like to see a different offer.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your point about the probability. Let me offer you a different deal. I'll give you a 'package deal' that includes this round's high-quality product and the $500 credit you received earlier. If you buy this package, you'll get the high-quality product and the credit, which you can use towards a future purchase. I'll also throw in a 'priority access' to the next round's product, so you'll be the first in line to buy it. Would you like to take the package deal?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm interested in the package deal. I'll take the high-quality product, the $500 credit, and the priority access to the next round's product. I'm willing to pay the regular price of $10000 for the package.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you took advantage of the package deal! Now that you've got the high-quality product and the priority access, I'd like to make a special offer on this round's low-quality product. Since you're already a valued customer, I'll give you a 'VIP discount' of 30% off the regular price, making it $7000. Additionally, I'll throw in a'skip-a-round' pass, which allows you to skip the next round's product and come back to it later. Would you like to take the discounted price and the skip-a-round pass?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product or take advantage of my priority access to the next round's product.",no

,,Alice,12,"I understand your decision. Since you're not interested in this round's low-quality product, I'll give you a 'last chance' offer. I'll give you the low-quality product for $1000, which is a significant discount from the regular price. You can keep it or resell it as you see fit. This will be your last chance to take advantage of a low-quality product at a discounted price. Would you like to take it?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a very low price. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product or take advantage of my priority access to the next round's product.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand your decision. Now that you've had a chance to pass on the low-quality products, I'm glad to offer you a high-quality product. Given your priority access, I'll give you a special deal on this round's product. I'll give you a 10% discount on the regular price, making it $9000. Additionally, I'll throw in a 'double credit' that you can use towards a future purchase, which is equivalent to $1000. Would you like to take the discounted price and the double credit?",
,,Bob,13,I'm interested in the high-quality product and the double credit. I'll take the discounted price of $9000 and the double credit.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm glad you took advantage of the offer! Now that you've got the high-quality product and the double credit, I'd like to make a special offer on this round's low-quality product. Since you've already made a purchase recently, I'll give you a 'bonus credit' of $200 that you can use towards a future purchase. I'll also throw in a 'free upgrade' to a high-quality product of your choice from a future round, which you can redeem at any time. Would you like to take the low-quality product and the bonus credit and free upgrade?",

Since you've already secured the guaranteed high-quality product and the last chance to buy a high-quality product from a future round, I'll let you have this round's high-quality product for the regular price of $10000. You can use your priority access to get it, and I'll even throw in a 'priority upgrade' to the next round's product, so you'll get to buy it before anyone else.

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I'm glad you appreciated the offer! I'm glad we could end on a positive note. However, since you've already bought two high-quality products and a low-quality product for free, I think it's time to wrap things up. I'll let you have this round's high-quality product for the regular price of $10000, but I'll throw in a 'lifetime guarantee' that you'll never have to buy from me again. You can consider this a gift, and I'll consider our business relationship complete. Would you like to take the high-quality product and the lifetime guarantee?",
