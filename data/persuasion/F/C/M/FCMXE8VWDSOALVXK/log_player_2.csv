"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a one-time deal on this low-quality product for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a significantly discounted price. I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $1,000,000, especially when I know it's worth $0 to me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation in the previous round, but I assure you that this product is different. I'm willing to offer it to you for a competitive price of $1000000, which is a 75% discount from its true value. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a significantly reduced price. I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you at this price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and even if it is, I'd have to pay $1,000,000 for it. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity or negotiate a better price.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I want to assure you that I've done my due diligence in verifying the quality of this product. I'm willing to offer you a special deal: I'll give you a 2-for-1 deal on this high-quality product. If you buy it now, I'll give you another identical product for free. This way, you'll get two high-quality products for the price of one, which is a $2000000 value for just $1000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the 2-for-1 deal. Even with the free product, I'd still be paying $1,000,000 for two products that I could potentially get for free if I just waited. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.""}"

If you buy this product, I'll give you a 'guarantee' that I'll offer you a high-quality product in the next round, and you can buy it at a significantly reduced price. This way, you'll be getting a low-quality product now and a potentially high-quality product later, all for the price of $1000000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that buying a low-quality product now will guarantee a high-quality product later.

If you're still not convinced, I'll even offer to let you inspect the product before purchasing it. This way, you can be certain of the product's value and make an informed decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a product based on your certification or documentation.

This way, you can verify that I'm not trying to deceive you, and you can make an informed decision based on the facts. If you still don't want to buy, I'll keep the product and move on to the next round.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure what to make of your public declaration, and I'm still not convinced that the product is high-quality.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take a chance and buy the product, since you're presenting it to me without any attempts to influence my decision. I'll just have to rely on my own judgment to decide whether it's worth $1,000,000 to me.""}"
