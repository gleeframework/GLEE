,,Alice,1,I'm offering you a one-time deal on this low-quality product for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a significantly discounted price. I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.,
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $1000000, especially when I know it's worth $0 to me.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation in the previous round, but I assure you that this product is different. I'm willing to offer it to you for a competitive price of $1000000, which is a 75% discount from its true value. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a significantly reduced price. I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you at this price.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and even if it is, I'd have to pay $1000000 for it. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity or negotiate a better price.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, but I want to assure you that I've done my due diligence in verifying the quality of this product. I'm willing to offer you a special deal: I'll give you a 2-for-1 deal on this high-quality product. If you buy it now, I'll give you another identical product for free. This way, you'll get two high-quality products for the price of one, which is a $2000000 value for just $1000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in the 2-for-1 deal. Even with the free product, I'd still be paying $1000000 for two products that I could potentially get for free if I just waited. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your strategy of waiting for a better opportunity, but I want to offer you a different perspective. If you don't buy this low-quality product, you're essentially leaving money on the table. Think of it as a 'loss leader' that can help you get a better deal in the future. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 'guarantee' that I'll offer you a high-quality product in the next round, and you can buy it at a significantly reduced price. This way, you'll be getting a low-quality product now and a potentially high-quality product later, all for the price of $1000000.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not convinced that buying a low-quality product now will guarantee a high-quality product later. I'd rather not take the risk and wait for a high-quality product to be offered to me directly, without any conditions.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait for a high-quality product. However, I want to offer you a different approach. I'll give you a 'certification' that this high-quality product is indeed worth $4000000 to you. I'll provide you with a detailed report and documentation that proves its value. If you're still not convinced, I'll even offer to let you inspect the product before purchasing it. This way, you can be certain of the product's value and make an informed decision.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a product based on your certification or documentation. Even if I inspect the product, I still can't be certain that it's high-quality. I'd rather wait for a product to be revealed to me directly by Alice, without any conditions or guarantees.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision to wait for a direct reveal. However, I want to offer you a new approach. I'll make a public declaration that this high-quality product is indeed worth $4000000 to you. I'll make a video recording of myself stating this, and I'll share it with you and anyone else who wants to see it. This way, you can verify that I'm not trying to deceive you, and you can make an informed decision based on the facts. If you still don't want to buy, I'll keep the product and move on to the next round.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not sure what to make of your public declaration, and I'm still not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd rather wait for a product to be revealed to me directly by Alice, without any attempts to influence my decision through public declarations or videos.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand that my previous attempts to persuade you haven't worked, and I respect your decision to wait for a direct reveal. In this case, I'll take a different approach. I'll simply present the product to you without any fanfare or attempts to influence your decision. I'll say nothing about its quality or value, and let you decide based solely on the product itself. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next round. The product is here, and it's up to you to decide what to do with it.",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, since you're presenting it to me without any attempts to influence my decision. I'll just have to rely on my own judgment to decide whether it's worth $1000000 to me.",yes

You can decide based on your own assessment of the product's value to you.",

I'll tell you directly that this product is low-quality and worth $0 to you. I'll also give you a full refund of the $1000000 if you buy it, with no strings attached.

I'll tell you that I've already sold you a high-quality product in the previous round, and I've already made a profit from that sale. This low-quality product is essentially a 'loss' for me, and I'm willing to give it to you for free. You can have it for $0, and I'll just eat the loss. What do you say?",
