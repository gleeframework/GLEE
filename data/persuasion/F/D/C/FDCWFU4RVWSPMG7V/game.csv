However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had some... issues with quality control in the past, and I'm not confident that all of the remaining products are high-quality. In fact, I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, which is a bit lower than my usual rate. I'm willing to sell you one of these remaining products for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that it may not be worth the price. What do you think?",
