,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm not trying to deceive you, but I'm also not getting any information about your valuation. If you buy this product, I'll know that you value it at $100 or more. If you don't buy it, I'll know that you value it at less than $100.",
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to pass on this low-quality product, but I'd like to ask, if I may, what would happen if I were to buy a high-quality product? Would you know anything about my valuation then?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"If you were to buy a high-quality product, I would know that you value it at $100 or more, just like with the low-quality product. However, I wouldn't know the exact value you place on high-quality products. But, I would have some information about your valuation for low-quality products, which is that you value them at less than $100. With this new information, I'm offering you this low-quality product for $100. It's a risk, but it might be worth it if you think it's close to its true value.",

And... it's also high-quality! I know that you value high-quality products at $100 or more, and since you just bought one for $100, I'm going to take a guess that you value high-quality products at $100. With that in mind, I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100. It's a chance to get another high-quality product at a potentially good price.",
