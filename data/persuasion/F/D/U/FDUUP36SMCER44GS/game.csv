It's a calculated risk, and I'm confident you'll make an informed decision.",

I'm offering you a chance to purchase a product for $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - the chances are slim. If you're feeling optimistic, this might be your chance to turn things around. But if you're a realist, you might want to think twice.",
