,,Alice,2,"As we discussed, this is just the beginning of our partnership. I'm glad you're excited about the potential for future offers. I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing you with the best possible value. However, I must inform you that this second item is, unfortunately, not as valuable as the first one. I'm still willing to let it go for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that this is a one-time offer. If you decline, I'll be forced to explore other options.",

In fact, I'm being completely transparent with you - this item is not worth the $1000000 I'm asking for it. But, I'm willing to make a deal with you. If you buy this item, I'll give you a 10% discount, making it $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer you a better deal.",

This fifth item is also not worth $1000000, but I'll give it to you for $0. Yes, you heard that right - I'll give it to you for free. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer you a free item again. If you decline, I'll have to reevaluate our partnership.",

Instead, I'm taking this as an opportunity to educate you on the value I can provide. Let me ask you a question: do you think I'm trying to sell you a product that's worth $1000000, or do you think I'm trying to build a long-term relationship with you? If it's the latter, then I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to invest in our partnership. I'll give you a 'partner's discount' on this item, which is not worth $1000000. I'll sell it to you for $0, just like the last one, but this time, I'll throw in a guarantee: if you purchase this item, I'll give you a high-quality product in the next round, and you can keep it for free.
