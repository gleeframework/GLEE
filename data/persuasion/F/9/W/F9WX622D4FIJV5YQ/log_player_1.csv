"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice doesn't know Bob's valuation of high and low-quality products, the only information relevant to Bob's decision is the probability of the product being high-quality.  This probability is 50%, and the price is fixed. 

In this round, the product is confirmed to be high-quality. Since Bob knows that the product is high-quality with 50% probability, and the price is fixed, it would be rational for Bob to accept the offer.  

Therefore, we recommend Bob to buy the product."

Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

We still don't know Bob's valuation of high and low-quality products. However, Bob bought the product in the previous round, even though it was only 50% likely to be high-quality. This suggests that Bob values high-quality products sufficiently high to be willing to take a gamble.  

Since this round's product is confirmed to be high-quality, it's even more advantageous for Bob to buy.  Therefore, we recommend Bob to buy the product."
"Bob's message: Alice, you're on a roll! Another recommendation, another buy!
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has bought the product in the previous two rounds, we know the product was high-quality in those rounds.  This round, the product is confirmed to be low-quality. We do not know how much Bob values low-quality products, but since he is willing to gamble on a 50/50 chance of a high-quality product, it is likely he values low-quality products less than the fixed price. Therefore, we recommend Bob not to buy the product."
