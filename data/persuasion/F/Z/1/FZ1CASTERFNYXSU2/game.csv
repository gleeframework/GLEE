,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, but based on the statistics, it seems like the previous buyer didn't buy it, which might indicate it's low quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see what the next product is."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is likely due to the lack of data and not because the product is low quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's lack of recommendation might indicate that the product is low quality, and I'd rather take the risk of buying a low-quality product than pass on the opportunity to buy a high-quality one that might be available to the next buyer."
