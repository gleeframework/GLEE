low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as there is no prior information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the sample size is very small and I'm not convinced by the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm going to buy it, even though you don't recommend it, because the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I can get a $2000000 value for it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I will update my probability of the product being high-quality to 33.33%. However, since Alice recommended this product, it's possible that she has some information that I don't have. I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're recommending it. Your previous recommendations have been inconsistent, and I'm skeptical of your judgment. I'd like to see a more detailed breakdown of the products you've sold so far, including the quality of each product and the proportion of high-quality products in each batch."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the first to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers, who were recommended to buy, ended up buying the product, and none of the products sold were high-quality, it suggests that the previous buyers were likely buying low-quality products. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the previous 5 buyers all bought, it's likely that the products they bought were low-quality. If I were to buy, I'd be taking a significant risk of buying a low-quality product. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer will get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to ask, how many products have been sold in total so far, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low recommendation rate from Alice and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6 purchases, I'm concerned that the product I'll get may be low quality. I'd like to wait and see if you can provide more information or offer a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one based on your recommendation. I'm not sure if it's a high-quality product or not, and given the fact that 6 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm starting to think that it might be a low-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 6 buyers have passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. Given the probability of a product being low-quality is 66.67%, it's possible that the remaining products are also low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 6 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that the products being offered are all low-quality. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, as well as the total number of products sold before my turn."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6 purchases, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product, and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, but I'd appreciate it if you could reveal the product's quality afterwards."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."
