**Reasoning:**

While there's a 50% chance of the product being low quality, Alice's recommendation provides valuable information. Since she knows the true quality, her recommendation to buy implies the product is likely high quality.  The fact that the first buyer purchased the product and it was high quality further strengthens the possibility that this product is also high quality.  

In this scenario, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one."
