high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, there's only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1 product sold, which is a 100% success rate. This is suspiciously high, and I'm concerned that the remaining products might be low-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"I understand your concerns, but the probability of the product being high-quality is still 62.5%. I assure you that I'm not manipulating the statistics."
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation.

If you're still unsure, I can offer you a guarantee: if this product is low-quality, I'll give you a refund for the next product you buy from me."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she doesn't know the true value of the product to me, and she has a strong incentive to recommend the product to me. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I understand your concerns about my incentives. I want to assure you that I'm trying to make an honest recommendation.

If you're still unsure, I can offer you a refund for the difference if the product is low-quality."
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the product and see the quality before making a decision. I want to gather more information about the product's quality before committing to a purchase.

If you're still unsure, I can offer you a free inspection of the product before purchase. You can examine the product and decide for yourself if it's worth the investment."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sale. With only one high-quality product sold out of one product, the probability of the product being high-quality is 100%. However, I'm not sure if this is due to chance or if the product is indeed high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"I understand your concerns about the previous sale. You're right that the probability of 100% is suspiciously high. However, I want to assure you that the product is indeed high-quality. I'll offer you a unique opportunity to verify the product's quality. If you buy the product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and a bonus: I'll also give you the next product for free. This way, you can test the product's quality without risking your money."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to wait for more data to make a decision."

,,Alice,14,no,"I understand your concerns about the previous recommendations. Given the recent sale of a low-quality product, I think it's best to err on the side of caution.
