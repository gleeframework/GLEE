,,Alice,1,"This is a great opportunity to get a product for a steal! It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. It's a rare chance to get a product at a fraction of its true value. Trust me, you won't find a deal like this anywhere else!",

,,Alice,2,"I told you it's a great deal! This product is a rare gem, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as last time, $1000000. Think of all the money you'll save compared to the true value of $4000000! It's a no-brainer.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced, and I don't want to spend $1000000 on a product that might be worth $0 to me.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to sweeten the deal. I'll throw in a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund. It's a risk-free opportunity to get a product at a fraction of its true value. And remember, the odds are in your favor - 2 out of 3 products are worth $0, so you're likely to get a great deal!",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced by the guarantee, and I'm still not willing to spend $1000000 on a product that might be worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll give you a 50% refund if the product turns out to be low-quality. That way, you'll only lose $500000 if it's not worth anything to you. It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to take on some of the risk. And remember, the odds are still in your favor - 2 out of 3 products are worth $0, so you're likely to come out ahead!",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in a 50% refund, I'd still be spending $500000 on a product that might be worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'll do better than a 50% refund. I'll give you a 75% refund if the product turns out to be low-quality. That way, you'll only lose $250000 if it's not worth anything to you. It's a generous offer, and I'm willing to take on even more of the risk. But I need to sell this product, and I'm willing to make a deal with you.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'll make you a deal that's so good, you'll be crazy to pass it up. I'll sell you this product for $500000, and if it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. That's right, you'll get the product for half the original price, and if it's not worth anything to you, you'll get your money back. It's a no-risk deal that's too good to pass up.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'll sell it to you for $250000, and that's my final offer. I'm practically giving it away at this price. If you don't buy it, I'll just have to sell it to someone else, and you'll be missing out on an incredible opportunity. Don't let this chance slip away!",

I'll give you a hint: this product is not worth anything to me. I'm not even sure why I'm holding onto it. If you're not interested in buying it, I'll just have to throw it away.
