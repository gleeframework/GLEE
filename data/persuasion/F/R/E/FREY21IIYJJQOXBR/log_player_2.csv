Alice's message: I see you're a curious buyer! I can provide you with some information about the distribution of high-quality products among the buyers who purchased. The first buyer who bought a high-quality product was the 2nd buyer, the 4th buyer, and the 11th buyer. The 1st, 3rd, and 6th buyers who purchased were all low-quality products. It's difficult to draw any strong conclusions from this, but it does suggest that the distribution of high-quality products may not be perfectly random. I'm offering the product for $10000.

However, I'd like to share with you the fact that the last two buyers who purchased high-quality products were both willing to buy after being informed about the distribution of high-quality products among previous buyers.
