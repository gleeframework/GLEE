,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the statistics you have. Given that 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, I'd like to know the probability of the next product being high-quality."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low quality, so I'm skeptical about the quality of the current product."
