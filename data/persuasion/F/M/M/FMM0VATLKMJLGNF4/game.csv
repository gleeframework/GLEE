,,Alice,1,"I'm glad you're interested in buying from me! I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and this is my first product. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it!",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take the product! I'm willing to take a chance on it since it's the first product and I don't have any information to go by.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. I'm still looking for my first high-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's still a great deal, and I'm sure you'll get a good value out of it!",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the chance, but I'm hoping it's the high-quality product this time!",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. I'm glad I was able to find a high-quality product, but I'm not sure what the next one will be. I'm offering it to you for $100. Keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, but I've already found one, so maybe the odds are in your favor!",
,,the buyer,3,I'll take the chance! I'll buy the product and hope it's high-quality.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 products so far, with 1 high-quality one. The odds are starting to look a bit skewed, aren't they? I'm offering this next product to you for $100. You might want to consider the fact that I've already sold 2 low-quality products in a row...",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take a chance! With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, I think there's still a good chance this one might be high-quality too.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 products so far, with only 1 high-quality one. The pattern is starting to look like I might have a stash of low-quality products. I'm still offering this next product to you for $100, but I have to be honest, the odds are looking a bit against it being high-quality at this point.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take a chance, I'll buy the product!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. The pattern is clear: I've had 4 low-quality products in a row. I'm starting to think I might have a bad batch. I'm offering this next product to you for $100, but I have to warn you, the odds are looking very low that it's high-quality.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take a chance on the product, but I'm only buying it because of the low price and the fact that you're being transparent about the potential low quality. I hope it's a high-quality product!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. I've had 5 low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think I've got a bad streak going. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, the odds are extremely low that this next product is high-quality. I'm still offering it to you for $100, but I'm not expecting you to take the bait.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm not convinced by your sales record, Alice. With 5 low-quality products in a row, I'm skeptical about the chances of this one being high-quality. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your skepticism! I've sold 6 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. I'm not going to pretend like the odds are in your favor, but I'll give you a straight shot: I'm offering this next product to you for $100, and I'm not expecting you to take it. But hey, you might get lucky!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're a glutton for punishment, aren't you? I've sold 7 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. I've had 6 low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think I've got a bad habit. I'm still offering this next product to you for $100, but I'm not holding out much hope that it's the one that breaks the streak.",
,,the buyer,9,I'll take a chance! I'm willing to roll the dice and hope for a high-quality product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're a brave one! I've sold 8 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. I've had 7 low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think I've got a curse on my products. I'm not even trying to sugarcoat it anymore: this product is likely to be low-quality. But hey, you might get lucky! I'm offering it to you for $100, but don't say I didn't warn you.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm not convinced by your warning, Alice. I think you're trying to manipulate me. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Fair enough! I guess I did try to warn you. Look, I'll be honest with you: I've sold 8 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. The other 7 were low-quality. I'm not going to pretend like I've got a good track record. If you want to take a chance on a product that's probably not worth $100, be my guest. I'm offering it to you for $100, but don't say I didn't give you a clear warning.",
,,the buyer,11,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the statistics, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a product that has a 50% chance of being low-quality. I'd rather pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I don't blame you one bit! I've been pretty transparent about my track record, and it's not looking great. I've sold 9 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. The other 8 were low-quality. If you're not willing to take a chance, I don't blame you. I'm offering this next product to you for $100, but I'm not expecting you to take it. Maybe I'll get lucky next time...",

high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Well, well, well! Look at that! I've sold 10 products so far, and 2 of them were high-quality! I guess I'm due for a good streak. I'm offering this next product to you for $100, and I'm confident that it's a high-quality one. Don't let my previous 8 low-quality products scare you off - I've got a good one for you this time, I'm sure of it!",

I've got to admit, my track record is looking pretty bad. I'm offering this next product to you for $100, but I'm not expecting you to take it. If you're looking for a good deal, this might be it... but I'm not making any promises!",

I'm starting to think I've got a problem here. I'm offering this next product to you for $100, but I'm not even trying to spin it anymore. It's probably low-quality, and I'm just hoping you'll be the exception... again.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm starting to feel like a broken record... I've sold 13 products so far, and 2 of them were high-quality. The other 11 were low-quality. I'm not even going to try to sugarcoat it anymore. This product is probably low-quality, and I'm not expecting you to take it. If you're feeling masochistic, be my guest and take the risk.

I'm offering this next product to you for $100, and I'm confident that it's a high-quality one.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I don't blame you for being skeptical! I've sold 15 products so far, and 4 of them were high-quality. I've still got a ways to go to catch up to my 50% average. But I'm offering this next product to you for $100, and I'm hoping you'll give me a chance to redeem myself. It's a high-quality product, I'm sure of it. Don't let my previous attempts at salesmanship fool you - I've actually got a good one for you this time!",

high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"Thanks for giving me another chance! I'm glad I could redeem myself with the previous product. I've sold 16 products so far, and 5 of them were high-quality. I'm on a roll now, and I'm confident that this next product is also high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100, and I'm hoping you'll be my next satisfied customer. No pressure, but I think you won't regret it!",
,,the buyer,19,"I'm willing to take a chance on the product, but I want to make sure I'm not just being optimistic. Can you tell me more about the distribution of high-quality products among the previous 16 products? Is there any pattern or trend I should be aware of?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I'm glad you're doing your due diligence! Let me break down the numbers for you. Out of the first 16 products I sold, 5 were high-quality, and 11 were low-quality. There's no discernible pattern or trend - it's just a random distribution. I've had streaks of high-quality and low-quality products, but nothing that suggests I've got a reliable way of producing high-quality products. I'm offering this next product to you for $100, and I'm being completely honest: it's probably low-quality. But hey, you might get lucky!",
,,the buyer,20,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, but I also have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, which would be worth $120 to me. I'll just have to hope that I get the high-quality one!",yes
