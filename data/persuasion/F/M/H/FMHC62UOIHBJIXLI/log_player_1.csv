"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and worth $300 to the buyer, while the selling price is only $100, it's a clear advantage for the buyer.  There is no risk involved, as the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, but doesn't know the specific product's quality.  Therefore, recommending a purchase is the best strategy in this scenario."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales history to go on, I'm going to trust your recommendation and buy the product. Fingers crossed it's high quality!
The buyer bought the product!

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now knows that you have sold one product, and it was high-quality. This information reinforces their initial trust in your recommendations. Since the current product is also high-quality, recommending a purchase is still the best strategy. The buyer is likely to be even more inclined to buy now, based on the positive past sale."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the buyer has a positive experience so far, this round's product is low-quality.  Recommending a purchase would lead to a loss for the buyer. Since the buyer is aware of the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product, it's not guaranteed that the buyer will purchase despite a positive track record.  It's more strategic to avoid recommending a purchase in this case to preserve your reputation for future rounds."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty, but I'll pass on this one.  Based on your recommendation and the statistics, it seems like the chances of this being a high-quality product are slim. I'll wait for a better opportunity.

**Explanation:**

Despite the previous round's low-quality product, you still have a good reputation. The buyer knows that you've sold two high-quality products and one low-quality product, which is a better track record than the initial 33.33% probability. This current product is high-quality, so recommending a purchase is still the best strategy. The buyer is likely to be more cautious but will still consider the positive historical data."

The buyer is likely to be confident in the product's quality and will likely purchase."
