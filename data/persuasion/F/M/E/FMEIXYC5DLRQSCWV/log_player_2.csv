Alice's message: I understand your concerns! I'm a bit surprised myself that my first two products didn't turn out to be high-quality. But I want to assure you that I'm not intentionally selling low-quality products. I'm just having a rough streak, I guess. As for my sales strategy, I'm just randomly selecting products from my inventory. I don't have any special way of choosing which ones are high-quality and which ones aren't. Would you like to take a chance and see if this one is an exception?
