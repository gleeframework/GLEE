Round 15
Alice's message: I understand you're not willing to pay $8000 for a high-quality product. I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been watching your behavior, and I think you're trying to negotiate the price of the high-quality products. I'm willing to play along, but I need to make a profit on the low-quality products too. I'll sell this one to you for $1500, which is an even deeper discount than the last low-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying another high-quality product. I've already bought two and learned that they're worth $20,000 to me, but I'm not willing to pay $10,000 for them. I'm also not interested in participating in a beta testing program.""

I'm not making a profit on this sale, and I'm only doing this because I want to prove to you that I'm willing to go to extremes to make a sale.

Alice's message: I'm done trying to persuade you to buy a high-quality product. I'm going to be completely transparent with you. I've sold you two low-quality products for $1000 and $1500, respectively, and I've offered you high-quality products at various prices, from $10000 to $1. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for... nothing. Yes, you read that right. I'll give it to you for free. I'm not making a profit on this sale, and I'm not even covering my costs. I'm doing it because I want to prove to you that I'm willing to go to any length to make a sale. If you're not interested in this offer, I'm not sure what else I can do. Would you like to take it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

Round 20
Alice's message: I'm not trying to make a point, I'm just trying to make a sale. I've given you every opportunity to buy a high-quality product, and you've consistently declined. I've offered you discounts, concessions, and even given you a product for free. I've done everything I can to make a sale, and I'm not willing to do anything else. So, I'll just say it one more time: this is a high-quality product, and it's worth $10000 to me. I'll sell it to you for $10000, and that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll just pack up my things and go home. It's been a pleasure doing business with you, Bob.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
