Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad to offer you a new product for $100. As you may know, my sales record shows that 50% of my products are high-quality, and we've already had one sale. Since the first product sold, I can tell you that it was a low-quality one. This new product is a different one, and I'm excited to share that it has a 50% chance of being high-quality as well. Would you like to take a chance and try your luck?

The first product was low-quality, and the second one was high-quality. Since we've had a mix of both, I can tell you that the probability of this new product being high-quality is still 50%.

Alice's message: I understand your concern! I'd be happy to provide more information. The first product was indeed low-quality, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the probability of the next product being high-quality is affected. Think of it like a coin flip - just because heads came up once doesn't mean tails is more likely to come up next. In fact, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%!
