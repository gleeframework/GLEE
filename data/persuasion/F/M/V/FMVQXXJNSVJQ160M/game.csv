high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'm not going to buy the product. I don't have enough information about its quality yet.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, since I have no prior information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there's no data to go on yet, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if I buy it, I'll get a low-quality product and I won't be able to get a refund. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I'm trying to estimate the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation from you, Alice. Can you tell me more about the product's quality based on the previous sales data?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 4 buyers having purchased and none of them getting a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that none of the previous 4 products sold were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and all of them were low-quality products, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass or a change in the statistics before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of my valuation, and she has already sold 4 products without a single high-quality one being sold, which suggests that the remaining products may have a lower chance of being high-quality. I'd like to wait for a more favorable situation or more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on my own assessment of the odds, not Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have rejected the product, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold?
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to take advantage of the information that the previous 6 buyers were all discouraged by her recommendations, which suggests that the products they got were low quality. This means the probability of the current product being high quality might be higher than 50%."
