low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, since it's the first one and I have no prior information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm inclined to pass on the product. I'm also aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 1, which is not a very reliable sample size. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendation. I'm curious to know if it's high or low quality, but I'm not confident enough to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one buyer having purchased and no high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I don't have enough information to justify a purchase at $10000 when there's a 66.67% chance it's worthless to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Given that you don't recommend it, I'm inclined to trust your judgment. Plus, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the product might be low-quality. I'll pass and see what the next one looks like."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is biased and I'm trying to break the pattern. If I don't buy, the product will be discarded, and I'll never know its quality. Since the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the expected 33.33%. I'm skeptical about the quality of this product and would rather not take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's recommendation is based on the product's quality, and the fact that none of the previous 3 products were high quality. This suggests that the product I'm being offered may be low quality as well. I'd like to wait for a new product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 previous buyers, I think the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still 33.33%, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 buyers have rejected the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, and given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't find the product worth buying, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product with a 66.67% chance of being low quality, especially given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me more about your previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is very low. I'm going to take a risk and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics, which show that all previous products were low-quality, but that doesn't necessarily mean the current one is low-quality. I'm taking a chance!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you've recommended 0 high-quality products to the previous 5 buyers. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the expected 33.33%. I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product, but I'm doing so with the understanding that I'm not following your recommendation."
