,,Bob,1,I'm not ready to commit to buying without knowing the product's quality. I'd like to see more information or at least have a chance to make an informed decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I completely understand your concerns, Bob! I'm happy to provide more information. This product is a limited edition item, and I'm only offering it to a select few. I'm willing to give you a special deal - if you buy it now, I'll throw in a bonus item that's worth $20. It's a great opportunity to get a unique product and a bonus at an unbeatable price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by the limited edition claim, and the bonus item doesn't change my decision. I'd still like to know the product's quality before committing to a purchase.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. Let me ask you this: have you ever heard of the phrase 'you get what you pay for'? In this case, you're getting an incredible deal on a product that's worth much more than $100. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - it's not the best product on the market. But it's a great value for the price, and I'm willing to stand behind it. If you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund. What do you say?",

What do you say, are you ready to take your business to the next level?",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not convinced by your claims. A 30-day money-back guarantee doesn't change the fact that I don't know the product's quality yet. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product, even with a refund option.",no

This is a one-time offer, and I think it's worth considering. What do you say?",

,,Bob,8,"Alice, I appreciate the report and testimonials, but I'm still not convinced.

I'd like to see more concrete evidence or a different approach before making a decision.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to propose a different approach. Why don't we meet in person and I can show you the product in action?

It's a one-time offer, and I'm only doing it because I want to clear out some inventory. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not convinced by the discount. A 50% discount on a product that's not one of your best offerings doesn't make it a good value for me, especially considering the risks involved. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.",no
