In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to offer you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll throw in a free upgrade that's worth $20. That brings the price down to $80. What do you think?

This product is definitely a winner, and I'm willing to let it go for the same price as the last one, $80. No free upgrade this time, but I think you'll find it's worth every penny.

Round 6
Alice's message: You're a man of faith, I like that! Unfortunately, this one might not live up to your expectations. I've had some issues with this product myself, and I'm not sure it's worth the $80. In fact, I'm so unsure that I'm willing to let it go for a steal: $50. That's right, I'm willing to lose money on this one just to get it out of my inventory. What do you think?

In fact, I'm so confident that I'm willing to offer you a money-back guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied, I'll give you a full refund. That's right, you can try it risk-free.

Round 9
