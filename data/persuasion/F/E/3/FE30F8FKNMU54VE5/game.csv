low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even without your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low sales rate of high-quality products so far. I'll give it a shot!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data. Can you share that with me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product's quality?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,

,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low sales record and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm willing to take the risk and hope that this product might be the first high-quality one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is there something about the previous sales record that makes you think it's a low-quality product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Can you provide that information?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and all of them were low-quality products, I'm going to assume that the recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold yet, and Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm going to take a chance and buy it. If I pass, the probability of a high-quality product remaining unsold will decrease, which might not be in my favor in the future."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product, considering the statistics so far. Is it because you think the product is likely to be low quality, given the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. Your lack of recommendation makes me think the product might be low quality, which is consistent with the 4/4 sales record so far. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product, which would be worth $20000 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers purchased the products, and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the 33.33% stated. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is still 33.33%. With that in mind, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned about the lack of high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me more about the previous products you've sold, and how you're determining your recommendations?"

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
