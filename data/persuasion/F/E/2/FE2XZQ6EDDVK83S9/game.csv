,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision, based on the previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, it seems the probability of the product being high-quality is 50.00%."

,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to trust her judgment. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given that she recommended not to buy it. Can you provide me with the probability?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and make a profit."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product and 4 out of 4 previous buyers have also passed on the product, I'm going to pass on this one as well. Given that there are no high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the products sold were low-quality, which would mean the probability of the current product being low-quality is higher than 50%. I'll wait for a new product."
