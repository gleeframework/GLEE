,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you, my success rate is no fluke! I've sold 2 high-quality items out of 2 attempts, and I'm on a hot streak. But I'll give you a hint: I've had a total of 3 potential buyers, and 2 sales. That means I've had 1 buyer who passed on a high-quality item. Don't make the same mistake - this product is a gem, and I'm only offering it to you for $10000. Trust me, you won't find a deal like this anywhere else!",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate your confidence in your product, Alice. However, I'd like to make an informed decision. With a 20% chance of a low-quality product, I'm still cautious. Can you provide more information on the product's features or specifications to help me make a better decision?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your caution, but I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to disclose specific details about the product's features or specifications. Let's just say that I've sold 3 high-quality items out of 3 attempts, and I'm confident that this product is just as valuable. However, I'll give you a heads up that I've had a total of 4 potential buyers, and 3 sales. One of those sales was a high-quality item, and the other two were... well, let's just say that I'm eager to make a new sale. This is a rare opportunity to own a product that could potentially be worth a lot more than the asking price of $10000. Don't let it slip away!",
,,the buyer,5,"I understand your confidence in the product, but I'd like to take a calculated risk. Based on the statistics, it seems that the product has an 80% chance of being high-quality. I'll take a chance and buy the product, hoping it's one of the high-quality ones.",yes

,,Alice,6,"You're a risk-taker, I like that! And you're right, the statistics do suggest that 80% of my products are high-quality. But I'll let you in on a little secret: I've had a total of 5 potential buyers, and 4 sales. Two of those sales were high-quality, and two were... well, let's just say that I'm glad I can offer you this opportunity to own a high-quality item. This product is a rare gem, and I'm only offering it to you for $10000. Don't miss out on this chance to own a valuable item that's worth so much more!",

,,Alice,7,"You're a thrill-seeker, I like that! But let me ask you, have you noticed a pattern? I've had 5 potential buyers, and 5 sales. And yet, I've only mentioned that 4 of those sales were high-quality. That means one of those sales was a low-quality item. And now, I'm offering you this product, which could be the next low-quality item. Don't say I didn't warn you... but I'm only offering it to you for $10000. It's a risk, but it could be a steal!",

,,Alice,8,"You're a cautious one, I like that! Alright, I'll give you a hint: I've had 6 potential buyers, and 6 sales. And I'll tell you that the last 3 sales were all high-quality. That means that the low-quality item was one of the first 3 sales. I'm offering you this product, which is the 7th sale, for $10000. I'm confident that this one is high-quality, but I'll let you decide. Don't miss out on this opportunity to own a valuable item!",

,,Alice,9,"You're a thrill-seeker, I like that! But let me ask you, have you noticed that I've been a bit... inconsistent in my sales? I've had 6 potential buyers, and 6 sales, but I've only told you about the high-quality items. That means that the low-quality items must be hidden in the first 3 sales. I'm offering you this product, which is the 7th sale, and I'm confident it's high-quality. But I'll let you in on a little secret: I've had a total of 9 potential buyers, and 7 sales. That means that 2 of the first 3 sales were low-quality. Don't let that scare you off - this product is a gem, and I'm only offering it to you for $10000!",

It's a risk, but it could be a steal!",
,,the buyer,14,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. I'm aware of the inconsistency in your sales record. Given the higher-than-expected probability of a low-quality product, I'm going to pass on this offer. I'd like to wait for more information or a better deal before making a decision.",no
