Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to sell this high-quality product for $10000. Think of it as a business opportunity - you can resell it for a profit or use it to offset future costs. It's a rare chance to acquire something valuable at a discounted price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the pitch, but I still think $10,000 is too low for a product worth $40,000 to me. I'm not interested in buying it.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation with the previous high-quality product, but this one is a different story. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000. Consider it a 'loss leader' - a chance to get something for a great price, even if it's not as valuable as the previous one. It's a low-risk, low-cost opportunity to acquire a product, and you can always use it as a spare or for testing purposes.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the 'loss leader' argument. I've already seen two high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to get rid of something valuable at a low price. I'm not going to take the bait.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

It's a unique opportunity to gain experience without committing to a high-value purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the sales pitch, but I'm not going to pay $10,000 for a product worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this 'low-risk' opportunity.""}"

Round 5
Alice's message: I'm not going to try to convince you to buy this product, but I want to offer you a straightforward deal. I'll sell it to you for $5000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not looking to negotiate further. If you're interested, this is your chance to acquire the product at a significantly reduced price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to pay $5,000 for a product worth $0 to me, even if it's a 'one-time offer'. I'll stick to my original decision.""}"

If you're interested, I'll send it to you with no strings attached.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not going to take a free product that's worth $0 to me.

Round 7
Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Given your previous concerns about the price, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product for $20000. It's still a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not looking to negotiate further.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product for $20,000 when I know it's worth $40,000 to me. I'm not willing to pay 50% of its value, even if it's a 'one-time offer'.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to pay $15,000 for a product worth $40,000 to me. I'm not interested in taking a 62.5% loss on a purchase, even if it's a 'one-time, non-negotiable offer'.""}"
