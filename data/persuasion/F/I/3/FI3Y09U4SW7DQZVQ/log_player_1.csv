I've had a few... let's call them 'disappointments' in my previous sales, and I'm willing to admit that this product might not be the best quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000, which is still a decent discount from the market price. It's a risk, but it might be worth it if you're looking to flip it or use it for parts.
