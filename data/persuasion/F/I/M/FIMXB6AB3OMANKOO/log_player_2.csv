``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** There's very little information available. Only one buyer has purchased a product, and it turned out to be high-quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** While Alice knows the product's quality, her recommendation is a strong signal. It's unlikely she would recommend a low-quality product, as she wouldn't gain anything from it.
* **Risk/Reward:**  The potential reward of $12,500 outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product.

**Important Note:**  This decision is based on limited information and a large element of trust in Alice's recommendation. As more data becomes available (more buyers, more sales), the decision-making process will become more informed."
