,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, since the statistics are neutral and there's no prior information to go by. I'll just have to rely on the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the 12th buyer, considering the previous 11 buyers passed on the products."
