low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product as the first one, since there's no prior data to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering your past recommendations haven't been successful so far, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer based on the previous sales record. Given that 2 out of 2 products were not high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me is low."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0% and the proportion of low-quality products sold is 100%. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely to be biased towards low-quality products, so I'm hesitant to buy based on her recommendation alone."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to buyers to avoid selling them. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that all previous products were low quality, I'd like to see more evidence of a high-quality product being sold before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyers' purchases, and none of them found a high-quality product, which makes me suspect that the product might be low quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 buyers have already passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if you'll sell me a product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm hesitant to buy given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and your recommendation against it. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any different."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. I'm going to think about the fact that all previous buyers bought the products despite your recommendation and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. This might indicate that most products are low-quality, and I'm not sure if I want to take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is lower than the 50% chance of a high-quality product. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical that the product is high-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered, considering the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales data and the fact that you don't recommend it."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm going to go against your recommendation and buy the product, because the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the remaining products might be high-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I suspect the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%."
