**Explanation:**

While the probability of a product being low quality is higher (66.67%), the fact that Alice recommends buying the product and that one out of two previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product makes it worthwhile to take a chance.  The potential gain of $2,500 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product."

I'll wait to see if another buyer buys the product and confirm its quality.""}
