"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance the product is low-quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($30,000) significantly outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.  Alice knows the value of each product and is recommending it, so there's a higher than normal chance it's high-quality.  It's a gamble, but a calculated one with a good potential payoff."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads-up, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable piece of information.  Since she knows the product's quality and is not recommending it, it's likely a low-quality product.  The risk of losing $10,000 for a product that's likely worth nothing is too high. It's better to pass and wait for a better opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty. I'll pass on this one as well.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's continued lack of recommendation strongly suggests the product is low-quality. Even though there's a chance it could be high-quality, the risk is too high given her previous information.  It's better to wait and see if there's a more promising opportunity later."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've recommended a good product before. I'm willing to take another chance on this one. I'll buy it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's lack of recommendation in the previous rounds strongly suggests the product was low quality, her recommendation now indicates a significant change. Since Alice knows the quality of each product, her recommendation should be taken seriously.  It's a risk, but the potential reward of $20,000 justifies taking it."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record has proven valuable.  She's made good recommendations that have led to high-quality products.  Her lack of recommendation in this round, coupled with her past accuracy, suggests a high probability of a low-quality product.  While there's always a chance it could be high-quality, the risk of losing $10,000 outweighs the potential reward.  It's best to wait and see if there's a more promising opportunity later."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's consistent accuracy in predicting the quality of products makes her a reliable source of information.
