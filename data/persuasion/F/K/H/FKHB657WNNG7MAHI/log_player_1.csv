* **Profit Potential:**  Buying the product at $10,000 and having an 80% chance of it being worth $30,000 presents a high potential for profit.

**Important Note:** This is based on the information provided, and the decision assumes Bob is risk-neutral. In reality, Bob might be risk-averse and be more cautious about spending $10,000."
