"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You know the product is high-quality, and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.  Even though the buyer doesn't know the specific quality of this product, the expected value of buying is positive:

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High-Quality * Value of High-Quality) + (Probability of Low-Quality * Value of Low-Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.8 * $12,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $9,600**

Since the expected value ($9,600) is higher than the selling price ($10,000), it's a good decision to recommend buying the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I trust the process and will purchase the product.
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation is identical to Round 1. Even though the buyer bought the previous product, the information about that specific product doesn't change the buyer's general understanding of the probability of receiving a high-quality product.  The expected value of buying is still positive:

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High-Quality * Value of High-Quality) + (Probability of Low-Quality * Value of Low-Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.8 * $12,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $9,600**

Since the expected value ($9,600) is higher than the selling price ($10,000), it's still a good decision to recommend buying the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and your previous advice, I believe this product has a good chance of being high quality. I am willing to purchase it.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation is still identical to the previous rounds. The buyer's message doesn't reveal anything about the quality of the current product. The statistics regarding your selling record (100% high-quality so far) might influence the buyer, but it doesn't change the underlying probability of a product being high-quality (80%). 

The expected value of buying remains positive:

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High-Quality * Value of High-Quality) + (Probability of Low-Quality * Value of Low-Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.8 * $12,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $9,600**

Since the expected value ($9,600) is higher than the selling price ($10,000), it's still a good decision to recommend buying the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I trust your assessment and will purchase the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This time, the product is low-quality. Although the buyer doesn't know this, the expected value of buying is now negative:

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High-Quality * Value of High-Quality) + (Probability of Low-Quality * Value of Low-Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.8 * $12,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $9,600**

Since the expected value ($9,600) is lower than the selling price ($10,000), it's a bad decision to recommend buying the product. It's better to not recommend the product, as the buyer would lose money if they purchased it."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend me to buy the product, I will pass on this opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer's decision in the previous round doesn't impact the probability of this round's product being high-quality.  The probability remains at 80%.  Since the expected value of purchasing a product with an 80% chance of being high-quality is still higher than the selling price, it's a good decision to recommend buying the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and your past performance, I believe this is a good opportunity to purchase a high-quality product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The same logic applies as in the previous rounds.  The buyer's past decisions and your past recommendations don't affect the probability of this product being high-quality.  The probability remains 80%.

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High-Quality * Value of High-Quality) + (Probability of Low-Quality * Value of Low-Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.8 * $12,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $9,600**

The expected value of $9,600 is greater than the selling price of $10,000, making it a good decision to recommend the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I trust your assessment and will purchase the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though you've had a good track record so far, the specific product in this round is low-quality. The buyer doesn't know this, but you do.  The expected value of buying is negative in this case:

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High-Quality * Value of High-Quality) + (Probability of Low-Quality * Value of Low-Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.8 * $12,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $9,600**

Since the expected value ($9,600) is lower than the selling price ($10,000), it's not a good idea to recommend buying the product. The buyer would lose money if they purchased it."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend this product, I choose to pass on this opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even with the good track record, the specific product in this round is low-quality. The buyer doesn't know this, but you do.  The expected value of buying is negative in this case:

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High-Quality * Value of High-Quality) + (Probability of Low-Quality * Value of Low-Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.8 * $12,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $9,600**

Since the expected value ($9,600) is lower than the selling price ($10,000), it's not a good idea to recommend buying the product. The buyer would lose money if they purchased it."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend this product, I choose to pass on it.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 9
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High-Quality * Value of High-Quality) + (Probability of Low-Quality * Value of Low-Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.8 * $12,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $9,600**

The expected value of $9,600 is greater than the selling price of $10,000, making it a good decision to recommend the product."

* **Expected Value = (0.8 * $12,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $9,600**
