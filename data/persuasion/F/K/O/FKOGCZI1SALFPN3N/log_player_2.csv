**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one previous sale to go on.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation, despite knowing the true quality of the product, is to buy. This is a strong signal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward (getting a high-quality product worth $200) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product worth $0. 

While the odds are still against us (66.67% chance of low quality), Alice's recommendation suggests she believes this particular product is high quality. It's a gamble, but the potential reward makes it worth taking the chance."
