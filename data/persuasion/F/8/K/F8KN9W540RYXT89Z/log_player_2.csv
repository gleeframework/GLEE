Alice's message: I know what you're thinking, 'Is this product high-quality or low-quality?' Well, let me tell you, I've sold 100 high-quality products out of 200 total. That's a 50% success rate, which is exactly what you'd expect if I was selling random products. But, I'll give you a hint: the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products I've sold is actually 100:100, not 100:100. Just a coincidence, right?

I'll give you a more straightforward message: I've sold 100 high-quality products out of 200 total, and the last two products I sold were low-quality. It's a 50/50 chance, just like the probability.
