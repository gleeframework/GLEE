But I can offer you a unique perspective: with 2 high-quality products sold out of 3 total products, the probability of this product being high-quality is actually lower than you might think. It's a calculated risk, but one that could pay off big time. I'm offering you this product for $10,000, and I'm willing to take on the risk with you. Are you in?""}"

But I'd like to offer you a different perspective: what if I'm not just selling you a product, but also a guarantee? I'm willing to offer you a unique guarantee: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you another chance to buy a high-quality product from me at the same price.

I'm offering you this product for $10,000, and I'm confident that it's high-quality. But I'll also remind you that the guarantee I offered earlier is still on the table.
