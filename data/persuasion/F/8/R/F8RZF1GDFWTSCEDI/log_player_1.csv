Still, I'm only asking $10000 for the product itself. Is that enough to change your mind?""

I'll give you a completely new offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $5000, which is a significant discount from the original price of $10000. But here's the catch: if you buy it, I'll also give you a 10% chance to buy a second high-quality product of your choice at the same price. It's a gamble, but it could pay off big time. What do you say?""
