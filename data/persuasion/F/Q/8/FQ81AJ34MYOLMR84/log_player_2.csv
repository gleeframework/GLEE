Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in the product. I want to be upfront with you - my previous buyer took a chance on my first product, and I appreciate their trust. However, I still can't disclose the quality of this new product. What I can tell you is that I have a 0% success rate so far in terms of selling high-quality products, but that's just a statistic based on a single sale. It's a new chance for both of us. The price is still $1000000. What's your decision?
