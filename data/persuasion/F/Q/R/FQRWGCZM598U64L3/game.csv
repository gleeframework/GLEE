,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the recommendation from Alice doesn't provide any information about the product's quality. I'm making this decision based on the prior probability of the product being high-quality (80.00%) and its potential value to me ($12500)."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the current statistics, but I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a final decision. Can I get a recommendation based on the product's quality?"

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given the statistics. The fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the sample is 0. Based on the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80.00%), I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, which would be the product's quality times the proportion of high-quality products in the sample. However, since the sample is very small, I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given that the previous buyer passed on the product."
