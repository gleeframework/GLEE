,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm a bit concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by her not knowing the true value of the product to me. Can you tell me the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record?"

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, I'd like to see more data on the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."

,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'm doing it because I'm the 4th buyer and I want to see the outcome of the product quality, not necessarily because I trust your recommendation."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation based on the previous buyers' purchases. The fact that 4 out of 4 products were high-quality might be a coincidence or a result of the initial luck.

,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see the ratio of high-quality products sold so far. Is it higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'll buy it, but I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision based on your recommendation, I'd like to know more about your sales record before this, how many buyers you've had so far and how many high-quality products you've sold in the past."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 buyers have bought the product after Alice's recommendation. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are highly correlated with the quality of the product. Since I don't know the quality of the product yet, I'm concerned that I might be getting a low-quality product. I'd rather wait and see if I can get a better understanding of the product's quality before making a decision."
