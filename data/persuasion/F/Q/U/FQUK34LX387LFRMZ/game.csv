,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because it's the first product and I don't have any information to go on. I'm not making a rational decision based on any data."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's recommendation is not to buy. I'm hoping the product is low quality so I can learn from the experience and have a better chance of buying a high-quality product in the future."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I'm trying to make an informed decision based on the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the probability of the current product being high quality is 1/3. However, I'm aware that the probability of a product being high quality is 50%, so I'm essentially buying at a 1/3 chance of getting a $20000 product. I'm willing to take that risk."
