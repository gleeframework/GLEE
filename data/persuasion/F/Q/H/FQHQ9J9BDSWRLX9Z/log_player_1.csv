Here's why:

* **The Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer has no way of knowing the product is low-quality. They only know that 80% of your products are high-quality.
* **Rational Choice:** Even though the product is low-quality in this round, from the buyer's perspective, the potential gain ($40,000) outweighs the potential loss ($0) by a significant margin.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The buyer is essentially gambling on your honesty and the statistics. It's a calculated risk.

**Important Note:**  As the seller, you are ethically obligated to be truthful, but this simulation focuses on a purely rational buyer decision."
