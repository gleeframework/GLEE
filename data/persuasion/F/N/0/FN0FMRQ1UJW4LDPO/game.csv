,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, there's only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1 sold so far, which is a very low proportion. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since I know the first buyer purchased it. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product's quality and why you think it's worth buying?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data on the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience before making a decision. What was the quality of the product they bought, and what was their decision?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/1 = 1. This is higher than the expected proportion of high-quality products (1/3). Given that Alice knows how much each product is worth to me, I suspect that the high-quality product was sold first, and the low-quality products are still available. Therefore, I'm inclined to pass on the product to avoid buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far?

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that only 1 out of 1 product was high-quality, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, and I don't want to overpay for a potentially low-quality product."

,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyer's purchase, which might have been a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for a more informed decision."
