high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm going to take the risk, even though you don't recommend it.
