```

You've now gone through 20 rounds without a single sale.  Your current strategy of not recommending the product isn't working. You're not building any trust with buyers, and they are highly unlikely to purchase. You need to significantly change your approach, such as:

* **Offering a discount:** This can incentivize buyers to take a risk on a product, even if there's no sales history.
* **Providing more information about your products:** This could help buyers understand the value proposition of your products and make a more informed decision.
* **Changing your communication style:** You could try to be more persuasive or build a rapport with buyers to create a more positive experience.

You need to be more proactive and take steps to overcome the buyer's hesitation.  Continue to not recommend the product, but implement new strategies."
