Alice's message: We'd be happy to help you understand the probability. Based on the 7 products offered to the 4 buyers who passed on the products, 2 of them were high-quality. That means the probability of a product being high-quality, given that a buyer passed on it, is 2/7 or approximately 28.57%. However, we want to remind you that this is a conditional probability, and it's not the overall probability of a product being high-quality.
