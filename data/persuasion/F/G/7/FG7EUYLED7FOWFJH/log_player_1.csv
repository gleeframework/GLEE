"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable making a purchase without more information. Your previous sales record doesn't reflect the actual quality of the products, as you haven't sold any yet. I'd appreciate it if you could share more details about the product, such as its origin, any certifications it may have, or any guarantees you can offer. I'll also need some time to consider your 10% discount offer.  Perhaps we can discuss this further once I have a better understanding of the product and its value.

Would you like to take it?""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but I'm still hesitant. The odds are still against me, and even with the discount, the risk is too high for me. I'll pass on this product for now.

Would you like to take a chance and buy it?""}"
"The buyer's message: Alice, while I appreciate the discount and the attempt to reassure me, your sales history is too small to establish any meaningful trend.  I'm not comfortable buying a product with such a high chance of being low quality, especially since I have no way to verify your claims about the quality of past products.

I'm also willing to throw in a 'buy-back' guarantee: if you're not satisfied with the product, I'll buy it back from you for $100,000. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While the discount is appealing, the sales history is a bit concerning.  The risk of buying a low-quality product outweighs the potential benefit, especially with a buy-back guarantee that only recovers a small portion of the purchase price.

Would you like to take it?""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, but I am not comfortable purchasing a product with such a low price without seeing any previous sales data. The 'double-or-nothing' guarantee doesn't address the risk of buying a product with a 66.67% chance of being low quality. I'd like to see some evidence of your products' quality in the form of actual sales data before considering your offer.

This way, you'll have complete transparency and can see the actual quality of my products. Would you like to take a chance and buy this high-quality product for $400,000?""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, but I'm not comfortable with the guarantee. I'd prefer to see the quality of the products you've sold in the past before making a decision.  Could you please reveal the quality of the past 14 products?

This is likely my last chance to sell this product, and I'm willing to make a very aggressive offer. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the discount is tempting, the recent streak of low-quality products is concerning.
