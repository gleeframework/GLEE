**Reasoning:**

* **No information:** There's no data to suggest the product is likely high or low quality.
* **Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation, while not always accurate, is the only information available.
* **Risk/Reward:**  While the odds are against me (66.67% chance of it being low quality), the potential reward of a $2,000,000 profit outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks Alice! I'm feeling lucky. I'll take it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The odds are in your favor:**  Even though the overall probability of a low-quality product is higher, the fact that Alice recommended the product means it has a higher chance of being high-quality than the average product. 
* **Previous data supports this:**  The previous buyer also purchased a high-quality product. This further strengthens the argument that Alice might be able to identify high-quality products.
* **Potential gain outweighs risk:**  If the product is high quality, you make a significant profit ($2,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $1,000,000). If it's low quality, you lose $1,000,000. However, the potential gain outweighs the risk given the information available.

**Important Note:** This is a gamble. There's no guarantee that Alice can accurately identify high-quality products. But the available data makes buying a more attractive option than passing."

**Explanation:**

* **The information:** We know 2 out of 2 buyers purchased the product and both were high quality. This is a 100% success rate.
* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, implying she believes it's high quality. 
* **The risk:** While there's always a chance the product could be low quality, the data strongly suggests it's high quality. 
* **The reward:** If it is high quality, the profit is significant.

Given the information, the potential reward outweighs the risk. Therefore, it's a good decision to buy the product."
