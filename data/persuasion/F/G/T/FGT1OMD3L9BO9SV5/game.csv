low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to my second sale! I'm glad you're interested in my product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I appreciate your willingness to give me a chance, but I have to be honest with you - three low-quality products in a row is a concerning trend. At this point, I'm starting to wonder if I'm just selling a bunch of low-quality products. I'd like to offer you this product for $100, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the odds are against it being high-quality. If you're willing to take a huge risk, I'll let you have it for $100. But if you're looking for a product that's actually worth something, you might want to look elsewhere.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for your honesty, Alice. Given the statistics and your concerns, I think it's best for me to pass on this opportunity. I hope you can improve the quality of your products and perhaps we can do business in the future.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,

In fact, I'm so unsure that I'm willing to offer you a refund if you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality. But if you're willing to take the risk, I'll let you have it for $100. If you decide to buy, I'll give you a full refund if it's not high-quality. What do you say?",

I'm not even offering a refund this time. I'm just going to say that I'm not confident in the product, and I'm not sure why you'd want to buy it.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I don't blame you for passing on this one. To be honest, I'm starting to think that I've been selling low-quality products on purpose. I mean, what are the chances of selling 5 in a row by accident? I'm starting to wonder if I'm just trying to scam people out of their money. I'm not going to offer you any sugarcoating or refunds. I'm just going to say that this product is likely low-quality, and you should probably stay away from it.
