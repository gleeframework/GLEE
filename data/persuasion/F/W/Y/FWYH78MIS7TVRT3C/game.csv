,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take the risk of it being a low-quality product, and I'm hoping it'll be a high-quality one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were low-quality, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that none of the previous two products were high quality, and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of the product's quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I think the probability of the product being high quality is still relatively high."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products may have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for a new product to be selected and see if the pattern continues."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy and all of them passed, it suggests that all 3 products were low-quality. This means that the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0. I'll take a chance and pass on this product, hoping that the next product will be high-quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on the fact that all previous buyers have also passed, and none of the products sold so far have been high quality. I'd like to know why you recommended it to me, though."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 attempts, the probability of the product being high quality is still 80.00%.

high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80%."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, I'd like to pass on this one."
