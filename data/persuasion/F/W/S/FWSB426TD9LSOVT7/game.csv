And let's be real, you're not going to find a better deal on a product like this anywhere else. I've got a limited supply, and I'm willing to let it go for $100 because I want to clear out some inventory. If you're willing to take a chance, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Plus, think of it as a fun little experiment - you can always use it as a backup or for a specific task. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this product?",

I'm willing to make one last, desperate offer to you. I'll give you the product for $40, and I'll throw in a third product of equal or lesser value for free. That's three products for the price of one, and I'm willing to take a loss on the deal. It's a one-time offer, and if you don't take it, I'll have to let the product go to waste. What do you say?
