high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take the recommendation this time. The probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and the potential gain is worth considering."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'm on a roll! The probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, and I've already had a positive experience with the previous product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I'm not going to get too confident. Two high-quality products in a row is a good streak, but I still need to consider the 20% chance of a low-quality product."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'm going to take the recommendation again, since the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"Three high-quality products in a row is a good streak, but I'm not going to get too comfortable. I'll pass on this one to see if the probability of a low-quality product is higher than I think it is."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,Four high-quality products in a row is a strong indication that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 80%. I'll take the recommendation this time.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,Four high-quality products in a row is starting to look suspiciously like a pattern. I'll pass on this one to see if the probability of a low-quality product is actually higher than 20%.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm going to take a chance on this one, even though Alice doesn't recommend it. The probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, and I've been burned by passing on high-quality products too many times already."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'm on a roll! Five high-quality products in a row, and now Alice doesn't recommend it. I'll take the chance and buy it, since the potential gain is too great to pass up."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I got burned by buying the last low-quality product, but I'll try to learn from my mistake. Since Alice doesn't recommend it, I'll take a chance and buy it, but I'll be more cautious this time."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I've been passed over a high-quality product before, and now I'm getting a recommendation from Alice. I'll take the chance and buy it, since the potential gain is too great to pass up."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"Six high-quality products in a row, and now Alice recommends it. I'm not going to get too comfortable, so I'll pass on this one and see if the probability of a low-quality product is higher than I think it is."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I've been passed over a high-quality product before, and now Alice doesn't recommend it. I'll take a chance and buy it, since the potential gain is too great to pass up."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"Seven high-quality products in a row, and now Alice recommends it. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a good indicator of the product's quality.
