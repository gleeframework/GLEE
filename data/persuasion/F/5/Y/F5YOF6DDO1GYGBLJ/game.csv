high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Thank you for taking the leap of faith! I'm glad you found the context helpful. As of now, we've sold a total of 40 products, with 20 of them being high-quality.

Considering this track record and the exceptional value of this high-quality product, priced at $10000, I believe it's a great opportunity. Would you like to proceed with purchasing this item?",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm going to pass on this one.
