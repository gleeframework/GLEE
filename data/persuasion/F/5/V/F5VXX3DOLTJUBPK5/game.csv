,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous two buyers also bought and no high-quality products have been sold yet.
