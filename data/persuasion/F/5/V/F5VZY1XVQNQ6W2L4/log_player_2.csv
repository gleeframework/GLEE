**Reasoning:**

The information provided is very favorable:

* **High Success Rate:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This suggests Alice is consistently recommending high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal, as she knows the true quality of the product and has a track record of recommending good ones. 

While there's still a risk of getting a low-quality product, the odds are heavily in favor of a high-quality product given the current data. The potential profit of $2,000 (the difference between the product's worth and the price) outweighs the risk."
