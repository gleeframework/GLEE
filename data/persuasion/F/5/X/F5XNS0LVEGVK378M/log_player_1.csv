Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Now that Bob has bought a low-quality product, he knows that at least one product is low-quality.

If I recommend buying the product, Bob will know it's high-quality and will pay $12,500, but I will only get $10,000. This is a loss for me.
