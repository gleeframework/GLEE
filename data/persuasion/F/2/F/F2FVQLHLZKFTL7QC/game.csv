high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product worth $4000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 75% discount. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else for the full price, and you'll miss out on this incredible opportunity.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I'd like to see more information about the product's quality before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability distribution of the product's quality?,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. To be transparent, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. As for this product, I can tell you that it's one of the 66.67% that are low-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is essentially a 'loss' for you, but it might be a good opportunity to practice making a low-stakes decision.",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. Given the product's low quality, I'm not interested in buying it, even at a 'loss'. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product to come along and make a decision that's worth $4000000 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your decision, Bob. Since you're waiting for a high-quality product, I'll give you some additional information to consider. Out of the 20 products I have, I've already shown you two low-quality ones. This means there are 18 products left, and only 6 of them are high-quality. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $1000000. It's still a 'loss' for you, but it might be a good idea to get one out of the way and make room for a higher-value opportunity.",
,,Bob,3,"Thank you for the update, Alice. I appreciate the information, but I'm still not interested in buying this low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product to come along and make a decision that's worth $4000000 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your decision, Bob. You've now seen 3 low-quality products out of 4, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is 33.33% is still correct, but the probability of the next product being low-quality is now 66.67%. However, I'd like to offer you a 'deal' - I'll give you a 50/50 chance to buy this low-quality product for $1000000, or I'll reveal the quality of the next product before you make a decision. Which option do you prefer?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying this low-quality product, regardless of the 'deal'. I'd rather have the option to make a decision on the next product after seeing its quality, as it might be high-quality and worth $4000000 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your decision, Bob. You've now seen 4 low-quality products out of 5, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and the probability of it being low-quality is still 66.67%. However, I'd like to offer you a 'last chance' to buy this low-quality product for $900000. It's a significant discount from the original $1000000, and it might be a good opportunity to get one out of the way and make room for a higher-value opportunity.",
,,Bob,5,"Thank you for the 'last chance' offer, Alice, but I'm still not interested in buying this low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product to come along and make a decision that's worth $4000000 to me.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're patient, Bob! As you know, you've seen 5 low-quality products out of 6, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually 50% (since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and you've already seen 2 high-quality products out of 6). However, this product in front of you is indeed a high-quality one, worth $4000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a 75% discount. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a significantly discounted price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"Wait, what? You're telling me this product is high-quality and worth $4000000, but you're selling it to me for $1000000? I'm taking it!",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Congratulations on your great decision, Bob! You made a smart move. Now, regarding the product in front of you, I'll be transparent with you. Considering you've already bought one high-quality product, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I'll give you a'second chance' to get a high-quality product at a lower price. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $1500000. It's a 62.5% discount from the original price, and it's a great opportunity to get another high-quality product at a significantly discounted price.",
,,Bob,7,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying another high-quality product at a discounted price. I've already made a great deal on the previous product, and I'm not looking to overpay for another one. I'll wait for the next product to see if it's high-quality or not.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your decision, Bob. You're being cautious and waiting for the next opportunity. Considering you've already bought one high-quality product and passed on the second one, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I'll give you a unique offer. If you buy this high-quality product for $1000000, I'll give you a 'guarantee' that the next product will be revealed to you before you make a decision. You can then choose to buy it or pass on it, and you'll know exactly what you're getting. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying this high-quality product with the guarantee. I'd rather wait for the next product and make a decision based on its quality without any conditions. I'd like to see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your decision, Bob. You're sticking to your strategy. Considering you've already passed on two high-quality products and this one is low-quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I'll give you a 'heads up' on the remaining products. Out of the 13 products left, 4 are high-quality. This low-quality product in front of you is one of the 9 that are not high-quality. I'll sell it to you for $800000. It's a low price for a low-quality product, and it might be a good opportunity to get one out of the way and make room for a higher-value opportunity.",
