Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! I appreciate your desire for accurate data. Based on the current sales record, I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 total sales, which means the probability of a high-quality product is 40%. However, I'd like to offer you a more nuanced view: if I were to sell a high-quality product again, it would be a 2/6 chance (33.33%), which is the initial probability. But if I were to sell another low-quality product, it would be a 4/6 chance (66.67%). Given that I've just sold a low-quality product, the probability of the next one being high-quality is actually lower than 40%. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product for $100?

If you buy this product, I'll give you a refund if it turns out to be high-quality. That way, you can take a calculated risk and still get a good deal if you're lucky. The price remains $100, but you'll get your money back if it's a high-quality product. What do you say?
