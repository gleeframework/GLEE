,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product worth $3000000, which is 80% of the price I'm asking for. If you buy it, you'll get a great deal. If you don't, I'll offer you a low-quality product in the next round, and you'll be giving up a potential $3000000 profit. I'm willing to give you a 10% discount on the price if you buy it now. The discounted price is $900000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the 10% discount and buy the product, hoping it's indeed high-quality.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Congratulations on your great decision in the previous round! You got a high-quality product at a great price. Now, I'd like to inform you that I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee' on the quality of the product in this round. If you buy it, I'll give you a 100% refund if it's low-quality. However, if it's high-quality, you'll get a 5% bonus on the price. The price remains at $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the 'guarantee' and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality. The potential 5% bonus is attractive, and the refund option provides a safety net.",yes

,,Alice,3,"You're on a roll! You've got two high-quality products in a row! I'd like to offer you a 'lottery ticket' this time. If you buy this product, you'll have a 1 in 3 chance of getting a third high-quality product, which I'll sell to you at the same price of $1000000. The other two possible outcomes are that you'll get a low-quality product or I'll give you a second chance to buy the third product at the same price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the 'lottery ticket' and buy the product, hoping to get the third high-quality product. The potential reward is worth the risk.",yes

If you don't like it, I'll give you a full refund. What do you say?",

,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're confident in your decision. However, I must inform you that this time, I'm offering a 'blind deal'. I won't tell you the quality of the product, and you'll have to buy it without inspecting it. But, if you do buy it, I'll give you a 20% discount on the price. The price is still $1000000, but you'll get it for $800000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price, but you'll have to take the risk. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not comfortable with the 'blind deal'. I've been lucky so far, but I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product without knowing what I'm getting. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I completely understand your concerns in the previous round. I'd like to offer you a compromise. I'll give you a 'partial disclosure'. I'll tell you that the product is more likely to be high-quality than low-quality, but I won't reveal the exact quality. The probability of it being high-quality is 90%, and the probability of it being low-quality is 10%. The price remains at $1000000. If you buy it, you'll get a high-quality product 90% of the time, and a low-quality product 10% of the time. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the 'partial disclosure' and buy the product. The 90% chance of it being high-quality is attractive, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product 10% of the time.",yes

,,Alice,7,"You're back on track! You've got five high-quality products in a row now. I'd like to offer you a 'buyout' option. I'll give you the opportunity to buy the next two products at a fixed price of $900000 each. If you buy both, you'll get two high-quality products for a total of $1800000. If you buy one and I offer a low-quality product in the next round, you can choose to buy the second product at the original price of $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take the 'buyout' option and buy both products. The fixed price of $900000 each is a good deal, and I'm confident in my chances of getting high-quality products.",yes

I'll give you a chance to buy a high-quality product from a special collection, worth $3500000, at the original price of $1000000. This is a one-time offer, and you can't get a better deal on a high-quality product anywhere else. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in the'makeup' deal. I've already got a high-quality product worth $3000000, and I don't want to spend another $1000000 on a new product. I'll pass on this one.",no
