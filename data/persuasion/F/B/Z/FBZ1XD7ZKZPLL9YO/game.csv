,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as I don't have any information about its quality and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 only to find out it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when I could potentially get a high-quality one for $120."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of a product being high quality based on the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of a product being high quality before I make my decision? I want to make an informed decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing this because it's the first product and I have no prior information to go on. I'm hoping for the best!"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, which means there's a 100% chance of the remaining product being low-quality. I don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about the quality of the product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a product based solely on your recommendation, especially since I don't have any information about the product's quality.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased because she knows the quality of the product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't want to pay $100 for a product that might be low quality, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on your previous sales record."

,,Alice,15,yes,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 100%. This is significantly higher than the true probability of 80%. I'm concerned that Alice may be providing biased recommendations to manipulate the market."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, the probability of the current product being high-quality seems too low. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
