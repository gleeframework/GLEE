Alice's message: Welcome to the second sale of the day! I've just sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 so far. This product is also a one-time offer at $10000. The ratio of high-quality products sold is 50%, which is already higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. This might be a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price... or it might just be a coincidence. The choice is yours.
