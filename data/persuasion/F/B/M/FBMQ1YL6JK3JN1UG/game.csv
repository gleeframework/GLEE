low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it. I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just have to rely on my initial intuition."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively high, and I'm willing to take a chance to get it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to see the product's quality for myself."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low quality. Given the high probability of a low-quality product (66.67%), I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality as well. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is there something I should know?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it, given the low success rate of high-quality products in the past."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. If it's low, I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that Alice recommends it. I'm worried it might be a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm the 6th buyer and I'm curious about the product's quality, and also I want to see if Alice's recommendation is correct or not."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have been offered the product and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is still at 0%. I'll take a chance and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not buying based on your recommendation.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'm not convinced that this product is high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers were discouraged by Alice's recommendations, I'm suspicious that Alice is trying to get rid of low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I'd be willing to take that chance."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 7, which is significantly lower than the expected 33.33%. This suggests that the current product is more likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the products are mostly low quality. I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 7, the probability of this product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, it's likely that the products sold so far were all low-quality, which would mean that the remaining products are more likely to be high-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product."
