,,Bob,1,I'll take it!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've already taken a chance on a low-quality product in the previous round. Since you're willing to take on some risk, I'll offer you another product for $1000000. If you're feeling lucky, I'm sure you'll make out okay.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not feeling so lucky anymore. I'd rather pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're being cautious, and that's wise. I'll let you in on a little secret: I've had a streak of low-quality products so far. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll offer you this next one for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to break the streak!",
,,Bob,3,I'm not convinced that the streak will break in my favor.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see you're a savvy buyer. I'll give you a more concrete offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% chance to get a refund of $500000 if it's a low-quality product. That way, you'll only lose $500000 if it's a dud. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in the 50/50 gamble, I'll stick to my initial decision to pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're a tough negotiator. I'll try to sweeten the deal. If you buy this product, I'll throw in a guarantee: if it's a low-quality product, I'll give you a free product from the next round. It's a chance to get something for nothing, and it's only $1000000.",
,,Bob,5,I'm not convinced that the free product is worth the risk of buying a potentially low-quality item.,no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism. Let me be transparent with you: I've had a string of low-quality products so far, and I'm starting to think I've got a bad batch. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll sell this one to you for $900000. It's a risk, but it's also a chance to get something for less than the usual price.",
,,Bob,7,I'm not falling for the 'bad batch' story. I'll pass on this one too.,no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've been upfront with you about the quality of my previous products, and I'm glad you've been cautious.

This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a significant discount. I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",
