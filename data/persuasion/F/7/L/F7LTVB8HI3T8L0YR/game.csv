high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, out of a total of 1 products sold. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and I've already sold 1 high-quality product, I'd say the probability of this product being high-quality is around 100%.

What do you think?",

I'm willing to sell this product to you at a discount of $900000. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that the discount is a one-time offer, and I'd like to negotiate the price further if I'm not satisfied with the product's quality.

What do you think?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800000 for it, as the 20% discount is already factored in. If it's low-quality, I'll accept the full refund.",yes
