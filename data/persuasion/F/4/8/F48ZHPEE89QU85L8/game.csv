Given that 3 out of 3 products were recommended and only 1 was high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4 purchases, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 25%. This is lower than the 80% probability of a product being high-quality. Given the low probability of this product being high-quality, I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,

,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm not sure about the product's quality, but I'd like to take the risk and buy it, hoping it's the 2nd high-quality product. I'm willing to take the chance and pay $100 for it."

,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not sure I should trust your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Can you share the probability of the product being high quality?"
