high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your business acumen. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $100000, which is a 16.67% discount from its true value. I'm confident it's a great investment, and I'm willing to take on the risk of not selling it to you at this price. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer another deal like this.",

However, I'm willing to offer you a 'certification' process that will give you a 50% chance of discovering its quality before making a final decision. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll provide you with the certification process, and you can decide whether to buy it at the full price of $1000000.",

If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000, and we'll start fresh with the next product. This way, you can try it out without any financial risk. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your perspective, and I respect your decision to wait for a high-quality product. However, I want to make a special offer that might change your mind. If you buy this product, I'll give you an option to 'pass it on' to someone else for free, essentially transferring the ownership to them. This way, you can still get the $1000000 back, and the new owner will take on the risk of it being low-quality. Would you like to consider this unique opportunity?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in this offer. If the product is low-quality, I'd still be out the $1000000, and if it's high-quality, I'd have to pass on the opportunity to own it myself. I'd rather wait for the next product.",no

If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a 20% refund of the purchase price, which is $200000. This way, you'll still get some value out of the deal, and I'll take on the risk of the product being low-quality. Would you like to consider this offer?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in the safety net deal. If the product is low-quality, I'll get $0, and if it's high-quality, I'll be paying $1000000 for it. The refund doesn't change the fact that I'm taking on a significant risk.",no
