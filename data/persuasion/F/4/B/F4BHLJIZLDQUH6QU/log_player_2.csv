**Reasoning:**

* **The odds are in your favor:** You have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $12,000. Even if you get a low-quality product, you lose $10,000, but that's less than the potential $2,000 profit.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice has no incentive to recommend a bad product to you. She wants to sell as many products as possible, and a happy customer is more likely to buy from her again.
* **The sales record:** While the sales record is small, it shows that Alice is able to identify high-quality products. This increases your confidence in her recommendation.

**Overall:** The potential upside of buying a high-quality product outweighs the risk of buying a low-quality product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!

**Explanation:**

* **The Odds are in Your Favor:**  The information provided is limited, but the fact that one out of three products sold was high quality implies a better-than-random chance.  This is because you are valuing the high-quality products at $12,000, while they are selling for $10,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if you buy a low-quality product, your loss is $10,000. However, if you buy a high-quality product, you gain $2,000. 
* **Limited Information:** Without more data points, there's no way to know for sure. However, the available information suggests a slight advantage to buying.

**Important Note:** This is a risky decision. There's a 50% chance you'll lose $10,000. This strategy relies on the potential for a higher reward outweighing the potential loss."
