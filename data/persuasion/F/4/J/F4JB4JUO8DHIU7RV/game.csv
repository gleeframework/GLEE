,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're recommending it. Your previous recommendations have been a good indicator of the product's quality, and since you're not recommending it, I'm inclined to believe it's a low-quality product. If I buy it, I'll be able to update the statistics and make a more informed decision in the future."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision, and I don't want to spend $1000000 on a potentially low-quality product."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, please."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and I can potentially get a $2000000 value out of it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. With 4 buyers having passed on the product and no high-quality products sold, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one too."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if I buy it, I'll end up with a low-quality product, and there's no guarantee that the next buyer will buy it, potentially wasting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the fact that you don't recommend it might actually increase the likelihood that it's a high-quality product, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 9 buyers didn't buy the product after your recommendation, and since no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the previous products might have been low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to potentially get a high-quality one."

,,Alice,18,yes,

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. Given the statistics, I'm aware that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, as the potential reward is substantial."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm not sure if this is a good product or not, but I'm willing to take the risk."
