,,Alice,4,yes,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'll take the recommended product, since the odds are still in my favor. I've had 7 high-quality products out of 9 recommended products, so I'll keep taking the chance."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are just a decoy to get me to buy more products. I'll pass this one and see if I can figure out what's really going on.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Ah-ha! I think I've figured it out. When Alice doesn't recommend a product, it's always low-quality. I'll take the chance and buy this one, since it's likely to be worth $0."
