But my friend also told me that the low-quality products have a peculiar smell, and the high-quality ones have a distinctive shine to them. I'm not saying this product has either of those characteristics, but I am saying that I'm offering it to you for $1000000, and I'm still willing to provide that 30-day money-back guarantee.
