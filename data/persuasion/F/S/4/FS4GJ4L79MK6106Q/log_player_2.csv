Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying the product without an inspection report for a standard product, and even with the inspection report, I'm not willing to pay $10,000 for a product worth $40,000 to me.

I'll also provide you with a detailed description of the product's features and specifications, which might give you a better idea of its value.

I'm also throwing in a complimentary service package that includes installation and maintenance, which would normally cost $2000.
