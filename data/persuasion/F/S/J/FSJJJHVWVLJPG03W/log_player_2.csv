**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record indicates a 100% success rate for high-quality products (4 out of 4).
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation implies she believes the current product is high quality, further increasing the likelihood of it being valuable. 
* **Potential Gain vs. Loss:** The potential gain ($20,000) is significantly higher than the potential loss ($10,000).  

Even though there's still a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the information available suggests a strong likelihood of it being high quality.  Therefore, it's a calculated risk with the potential for a significant reward."
