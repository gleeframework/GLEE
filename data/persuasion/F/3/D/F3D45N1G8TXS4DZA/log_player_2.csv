**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product and recommends buying it. This is valuable information, especially since the seller's recommendation is known to be accurate in this game.
* **Prior Information:** There's only one previous sale, and it was a high-quality product. This supports the idea that the current product is likely high quality. 
* **Expected Value:** Even with the 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $120 from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $100.  

**While there's risk, the information available suggests a high probability of a positive outcome.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  Since two out of two previous buyers bought high-quality products, the success rate is currently 100%.  
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the purchase adds further confidence. While she knows the product's quality, her past record suggests she's likely recommending good products.

**Important Note:**  This assumes trust in Alice's recommendations. In real-world scenarios, it's always wise to factor in the possibility of deception or bias."
