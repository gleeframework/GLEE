,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now, considering the 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%, but the recommendation from Alice doesn't seem to be very reliable so far."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were recommended by Alice and both were low quality, I'm suspicious that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous two buyers didn't buy, or is there some other information that led you to advise against purchasing?"

,,Alice,11,no,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it's likely that the products recommended so far were all low-quality. I'd like to see a more balanced distribution of recommendations before making a purchase."
