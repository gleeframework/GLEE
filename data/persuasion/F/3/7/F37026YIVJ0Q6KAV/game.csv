,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this product! As a seller, I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing the best possible experience. With 1 out of 3 products being high-quality, I'm confident that you'll be pleased with your purchase. The price of $100 is a great value, considering the potential benefits of a high-quality product. Plus, I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a low-quality product to you, which means I'm essentially guaranteeing that you'll get a good deal either way. So, what do you say? Are you ready to take the chance and see what you get?",

However, I want to emphasize that this is just a small sample size, and the true probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%.

But, as a seller, I can assure you that each product has an equal chance of being high-quality. The price of $100 remains the same, and I'm still willing to take on the risk of selling a low-quality product to you. So, are you willing to take another chance and see what you get?",
