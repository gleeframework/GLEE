,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance, it's the first product and I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just take it as is."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer is more optimistic."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have passed on the products. Given the 0 high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to think that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to know if there's any information that suggests the current product is high-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 previous purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. I'd rather wait for a new product or get more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as you don't recommend it. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate a higher likelihood of a low-quality product being offered to me."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendations are based on the product quality, which means she's only recommending low-quality products so far. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even if you don't recommend it, I'll buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending me to buy the product, and what's the probability that it's high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,

,,Alice,19,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendations, I'm assuming that the low-quality products have been sold and the high-quality products have not. This means that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely to be higher than the overall average. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's high quality."
