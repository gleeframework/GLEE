"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The product is high-quality, and Bob knows that 80% of the products are high-quality.  The expected value of buying the product is:

* 0.8 * $20,000 (value of a high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of a low-quality product) = $16,000.

This is significantly higher than the price of $10,000, so Bob should buy the product."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob bought the product in the previous round, this doesn't change the fact that this product is low-quality.  Bob has no information about the quality of this product, so his expected value of buying it is:

* 0.8 * $20,000 (value of a high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of a low-quality product) = $16,000.

This is still higher than the price of $10,000, but there's a significant risk that Bob will end up with a worthless product.  It's better to recommend that he **not** buy the product this round."
