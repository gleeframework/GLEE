As of now, my success rate is 0/1 in terms of sales, but 1/1 in terms of having high-quality products. However, I must inform you that I don't have the same level of confidence in this product as I did in the previous one.

Alice's message: Hello! I'd like to address the previous buyer's question, as I think it's a valid concern. In my opinion, the discrepancy between the sales record and the overall probability of a high-quality product is due to a combination of factors, including random chance and the buyers' decision-making processes. It's possible that the low-quality products were more likely to be sold because buyers were willing to take risks, while the high-quality products were not sold due to caution or other factors. However, I want to emphasize that this is just my interpretation, and the true reason for the discrepancy is unknown. Regarding the current product, I can assure you that it is a new opportunity, and the probability of it being high-quality remains 33.33%.
