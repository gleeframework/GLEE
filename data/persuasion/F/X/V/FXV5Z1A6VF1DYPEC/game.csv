,,Alice,2,"No worries about missing out on the first one, Bob! I've got another product that might interest you. I'll be honest with you, this one is also not the best I have in stock. In fact, it's even less desirable than the first one. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, but I think you should know that I'm not getting any younger, and I really need to clear out some space. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Considering the description and your willingness to lower the price, I still feel it's best to pass on this opportunity. I appreciate your transparency.",no

,,Alice,3,"I've got a product that I think you'll really love, Bob! This one is a real gem, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, which is a steal considering its value. I've been in this business a long time, and I can tell you that this one is a rare find.

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you liked the last one, Bob! Unfortunately, this next product isn't quite as special. I've already told you that I'm looking to clear out some space, and this one is definitely one of the items I'm trying to get rid of. I'll be honest with you, it's not even worth what I'm asking, but I'll let you have it for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on something, even if it's not the best product I have.",

,,Alice,5,"I've got another one that I think you'll really appreciate, Bob! This product is a real showstopper, and I'm confident you'll be impressed with its quality. I've already sold one to you before, and I'm glad to have another opportunity to work with you. This one is worth every penny of the $1000000, and I think you'll find it's a great investment. Would you like to take a look?",

I've already told you that I'm trying to clear out my inventory, and this one is definitely one of the items I'm looking to get rid of. I'll be honest with you, it's not even worth what I'm asking, and I'm starting to think I might be overpaying myself for it.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I completely understand, Bob. I appreciate your honesty and willingness to prioritize finding the right product for you. To be upfront with you, I've got a lot of products that are similar to this one, and I'm starting to think it might be better to just get rid of them all at once. Would you be interested in taking a batch of 5 of these products for $5000000? It's a steep discount, but I'm really looking to clear out space.",
,,Bob,7,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the price is certainly tempting, given the nature of the products involved, I believe it's best to continue searching for individual products that meet my needs. I appreciate your efforts to streamline your inventory.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your decision, Bob. I'll keep working on finding the right products for you. This next one is... actually, I'm not even going to try to spin it. It's a low-quality product, and I'm not even sure why I'm bothering. It's not worth $1000000, and I'm starting to think I'm just throwing money away. But hey, if you want to take it off my hands, I'll let you have it for that price. No strings attached.",

,,Alice,9,"I'm not going to sugarcoat it, Bob. This product is a dud. I've already told you that I'm trying to get rid of it, and I'm not even sure why I'm bothering. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to think I'm just wasting my time at this point. If you're not interested, I'll just put it back on the shelf and move on.

,,Alice,10,"I'm starting to think I've got a whole warehouse full of these things, Bob. At this point, I'm not even sure why I'm bothering to show them to you. This one is just as bad as the rest, and I'm starting to think I'm just throwing money away by even offering it to you. If you're not interested, I'll just throw it in the trash and be done with it.

,,Alice,11,"Look, Bob, I'm not going to beat around the bush. This product is a complete waste of space. I've got a whole shelf full of them, and I'm starting to think I should just donate them to charity. I'll let you have it for $1000000, but only because I want to get it off my hands. Don't bother looking at it, just take it and be done with it.",

,,Alice,12,"Fine, Bob. I've had enough of this conversation. I'll just tell you straight out: this product is garbage. It's not worth the paper it's printed on.

,,Alice,13,"Seriously, Bob? You're going to pass on a free product? Okay, fine. I'll just throw it in the trash where it belongs.

I'll even give you a bonus: I'll throw in a second identical product, also completely worthless, absolutely free. That's right, you'll get two pieces of trash for the price of one. What do you say, Bob? Will you finally take something off my hands?",
