high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know what the probability of it being high quality is before I make a final decision. Can you provide that?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'd like to see the quality of the product for myself."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the total number of products offered so far, the number of high-quality products offered so far, and the proportion of high-quality products offered so far. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or the fact that I'm the third buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain why you think this product is not worth buying?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 2 products sold was high-quality, which is a lower proportion than the 80% probability of a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the proportion of high-quality products sold increases."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5. Given the probability of a high-quality product is 80.00%, I believe the true proportion of high-quality products should be higher than 0.5. Therefore, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and would rather pass on it."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she has already sold a high-quality product, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'm not convinced by your recommendation."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see if you'll give me more information about the previous sales record.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling high-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product based on your recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 2 products sold, which means the probability of this product being low-quality is relatively high. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the low-quality product ratio is higher than expected given the recommendation rate.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased, and I want to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high quality (0.8). I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, I think it's more likely that the remaining product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product, which might have a higher chance of being high-quality."
