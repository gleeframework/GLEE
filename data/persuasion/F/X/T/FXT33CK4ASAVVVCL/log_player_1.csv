"Bob's message: I'm willing to take the risk and buy the current product, hoping to get a high-quality product at the initial price in the next round. I'm not sure if it's worth it, but the increasing probability of getting a high-quality product at a higher price in the next round makes it a tempting offer.

  ""message"": ""I understand your strategy, but I'll give you a new perspective: the probability of getting a high-quality product at the initial price is now extremely low, as I've sold two high-quality products already. This low-quality product is actually a great opportunity to get a 'free' chance to get a high-quality product at a higher price in the next round. Think of it as a 'free lottery ticket' with a high potential reward. The price remains the same, $1,000,000.""

"Bob's message: I'm not buying the low-quality product. I'd rather take the 'free lottery ticket' and get a chance to get a high-quality product at a higher price in the next round, rather than spending $1000000 on a product that's worth $0 to me.
