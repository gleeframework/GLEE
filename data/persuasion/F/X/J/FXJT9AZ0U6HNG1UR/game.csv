,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm willing to buy the product as the first one, and I'll see what happens."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the statistics and my own risk assessment."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers purchased the product, it's likely that all previous products were low-quality. I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because I don't have any information to go on and Alice's recommendation doesn't carry much weight. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm prepared to be disappointed."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous buyers passed on the products. If all previous buyers passed, it's likely that the products were low-quality, so I'm taking a chance on the fact that this one might be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a contrarian, and I think the fact that you don't recommend it increases its value to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm skeptical of your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the current statistics, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which suggests a potential bias towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold to the total number of products sold so far, and the proportion of low-quality products sold to the total number of products sold so far, to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the fact that 7 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. This makes me skeptical about the quality of the current product, and I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 7 buyers have passed on the product, which suggests a low-quality product is more likely. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 8 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm going to buy it, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 50% and the previous buyers didn't find it valuable, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 9 out of 9 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since you don't recommend it, I'm guessing it's low-quality. I'll pass on it."
