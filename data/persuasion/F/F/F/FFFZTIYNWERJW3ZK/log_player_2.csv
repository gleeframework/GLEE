Alice's message: I'm glad you were willing to take the risk and make a deal. However, I must inform you that the previous buyer's comment has given me some insight. It seems that the full price of $10000 might be a bit steep for some buyers, even with an 80% chance of a high-quality product. I'm willing to make a concession on the price for this next product. I'll sell it to you for $8000. It's still a great deal, considering the 80% chance of it being high-quality. Would you like to buy it?

Alice's message: The previous buyer mentioned that they were only willing to accept the 50/50 split because they were unsure if they'd be willing to pay the full price of $10000, even with the 80% chance of it being high-quality. This suggests that the value of a high-quality product to them might be lower than $10000. As for the sales record, I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total products sold. The probability of the next product being high-quality is 80%. However, considering the previous buyer's comment, I'm willing to offer you a 75/25 split on the price if you're willing to take the risk. Would you like to buy it for $2500?
