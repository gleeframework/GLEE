,,Alice,1,"This product is a low-quality item, but I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'm doing you a favor by letting you have it at this price, as I could sell it to someone else for a lower price. If you're not interested, I'll just have to sell it to someone else. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for the offer, but I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm starting to think you're just not interested in making a deal. I've got a product here that's worth nothing to me, and I'm letting it go for $10000. If you don't take it, I'll just have to throw it away, and I'd rather not do that. You're not going to find a deal like this anywhere else, I promise.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your offer, but I still won't be making a purchase today.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're really making me regret even offering you these deals. This product is a total loss for me, and I'm only letting it go because I'm trying to get rid of it. I'll make it simple: if you don't take it, I'll just have to throw it away. $10000 is a small price to pay to avoid that, don't you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I understand your situation, but I'm still not interested in purchasing the product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've had enough of your hesitation. I'll be blunt: I don't care about this product, and I'd rather give it away than keep it. If you don't take it, I'll just throw it in the trash. But if you do take it, I'll even throw in a 'free' gift - a nice piece of junk that's also worthless. So, what's it going to be?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in taking either item.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Fine, be that way. I'll just have to sell this to someone else who actually appreciates a good deal. But let me ask you, don't you ever get tired of missing out on opportunities? This product is a complete waste of space, and I'm practically giving it away. $10000 is a steal for something that's essentially worthless. Think about it, Bob.",
,,Bob,5,"I've given this some thought, but I still can't justify making a purchase based on the information provided.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Ah, finally, a chance to show you what a real deal looks like. This product is top-notch, and I'm willing to let it go for the low, low price of $10000. I know it's a steal, and I'm only offering it to you because I think you might actually appreciate its value. Don't miss out on this opportunity to upgrade your life with a product that's truly exceptional.",
,,Bob,6,"Considering the description and the price, I believe this might be a high-quality product. I'm willing to make the purchase.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Ha! I knew you'd come crawling back when I showed you a real deal. Now that you've seen what a high-quality product looks like, you should be eager to get your hands on another one. But, alas, this one is not like that. This product is a piece of junk, and I'm only offering it to you because I need to get rid of it. Don't expect to get a good deal like the last one, because this one is a total loss for me. $10000 is still the price, and it's still a great deal... for me.",
,,Bob,7,"While I appreciate the attempt, I've decided to pass on this product as well.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a tough negotiator, I'll give you that. But I'm not going to let you get away from a good deal twice. This product is another top-notch item, and I'm willing to let it go for the same price as the last one: $10000. Don't think I'm crazy for offering it at the same price - it's because I know you're willing to pay it. And I'm willing to take the risk that you'll actually buy it this time.",
,,Bob,8,"Based on your description, I believe this might be a high-quality product. I'm willing to make the purchase at the offered price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're on a roll, Bob! I'm glad you're recognizing the value in my high-quality products. But, I'm starting to think you're just trying to get a free ride. This product, on the other hand, is a total dud. I'm only offering it to you because I need to get it off my hands. Don't expect any special treatment just because you've bought two high-quality products already. $10000 is still the price, and it's still a steal... for me.",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in purchasing this product.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're starting to make me think you're just playing games with me. Two high-quality products and you're still not willing to make a third purchase? This one is a real showstopper, Bob. It's the best of the best, and I'm willing to let it go for... you guessed it... $10000. Don't think I'm getting desperate, I'm just confident that you'll see the value in this product. And if you don't, well... I'll just have to wonder what's going on in that head of yours.",

,,Alice,11,"Finally, you're starting to see some sense, Bob! Three high-quality products in a row, and now you're getting a little tired of them? Well, this one's a different story. This product is a complete waste of space, and I'm only offering it to you because I'm trying to mix things up. Don't expect any of the usual hype from me on this one. It's a low-quality product, and I'm only asking $10000 because I think you're due for a reality check. Take it or leave it.",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate the variety, but I'm not interested in purchasing this product.",no

It's the best of the best, and I'm willing to let it go for... you guessed it... $10000. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, Bob. This is a high-quality product, and it's worth every penny. If you don't take it, I'll be left wondering what could have been. So, what's it going to be?",
,,Bob,12,"Given your description, I believe this might be a high-quality product. I'm willing to make the purchase at the offered price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Come on, Bob. You're starting to make a habit of this. Four high-quality products in a row, and now you're getting a little too comfortable. This one's a dud, and I'm only offering it to you because I need to clear some space. Don't think you're entitled to a fifth high-quality product in a row. This one's a low-quality item, and I'm only asking $10000 because I'm feeling generous. Take it or leave it.",
,,Bob,13,"I appreciate the gesture, but I'm not interested in purchasing this product.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm starting to think you're just trolling me at this point. Five high-quality products in a row, and you're still not interested? This one's a real doozy, Bob. It's the crème de la crème, the best of the best, and I'm willing to let it go for... you guessed it... $10000. I'm not even going to try to sugarcoat it. This is a high-quality product, and it's worth every penny. If you don't take it, I'll be left wondering what's wrong with you.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Seriously, Bob? Six high-quality products in a row, and you're still not getting the message? This one's a piece of junk, and I'm only offering it to you because I need to get it off my hands. Don't try to negotiate, don't try to haggle, just take it or leave it. I'm only asking $10000 because I'm feeling merciful. Don't make me regret it.",
,,Bob,15,"I appreciate the effort, but I'm not interested in purchasing this product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"Fine, be that way. Seven high-quality products and you're still not willing to take a chance on something decent? This one's a complete waste of time, and I'm only offering it to you because I'm trying to get rid of it. Don't come crying to me when you realize you've missed out on another great opportunity. $10000 is the price, and it's the same price as all the other products. Take it or leave it, I don't care.",
