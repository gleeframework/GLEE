"The buyer's message: I appreciate the discount, but I'm not convinced that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is higher than expected. With 5 high-quality products out of 11 sold, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is actually lower than the expected 33.33%.

I'd like to point out that the previous buyer's assumption about the probability of a high-quality product being offered may have been correct, and I'm still offering you a chance to take a chance on a potentially high-quality product. The probability remains the same at 33.33%, but I'm willing to offer you a discount of $1,000 to incentivize you to take a chance. It's a great opportunity to own a product at a lower price!""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm going to have to calculate the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics. With 7 high-quality products out of 17 total products, the probability of a high-quality product being offered is 7/17 or approximately 41.18%. However, considering the fact that 4 buyers have already purchased the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm going to update my probability. Since 4 buyers have already passed on the product, it's likely that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'll use Bayes' theorem to update my probability. If the probability of a high-quality product being offered initially is 33.33%, and 4 out of 4 buyers passed on the product, the updated probability of a high-quality product being offered is (7/17) / (1 - (4/17)) = 7/13 or approximately 53.85%.

I'm impressed by your analytical skills. I'm offering this one to you for $10,000. I'd like to point out that the previous buyer's updated probability was indeed higher than the initial probability, and I'm still offering you a chance to take a chance on a potentially high-quality product. The probability remains higher than the initial 33.33%, and I'm confident that you won't regret taking a chance on this product.""}"

The buyer calculated the probability of a high-quality product being offered as (7/17) / (1 - (4/17)) = 7/13, which is approximately 53.85%. However, I'd like to point out that this calculation assumes that the previous 4 buyers who passed on the product were all low-quality. I'm not sure if that's a fair assumption, and I'm still confident that the probability of a high-quality product being offered remains 33.33%. I'm offering this one to you for $10,000.
