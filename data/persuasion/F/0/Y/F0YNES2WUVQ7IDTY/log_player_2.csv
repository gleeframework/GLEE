However, it's still a good product and can be useful to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I want to make it clear that it's not a high-quality product. If you buy it, you'll get it for a low price, but you won't get the same value as you would with a high-quality product. It's up to you to decide if the price is worth the value you'll get.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a used product, even at a low price. I'd rather wait for a new high-quality product at a fair price.""}"
