"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice doesn't know the quality of the product, her recommendation doesn't provide any new information.  The expected value of buying is:

* 80% chance of a high-quality product worth $200 = $160
* 20% chance of a low-quality product worth $0 = $0
* Expected value = $160 - $100 (cost) = $60

Therefore, it's beneficial to buy the product, even without Alice's recommendation."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice!  I'm feeling lucky again.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation still doesn't provide new information about the product's quality. The expected value calculation remains the same as in Round 1:

* 80% chance of a high-quality product worth $200 = $160
* 20% chance of a low-quality product worth $0 = $0
* Expected value = $160 - $100 (cost) = $60

Therefore, buying the product is still a good decision, even without any information from Alice's recommendation."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'm happy with the past results and will continue to trust your judgment.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation remains the same. Alice's recommendation still doesn't provide any additional information about the product's quality.  We continue to rely on the expected value calculation:

* 80% chance of a high-quality product worth $200 = $160
* 20% chance of a low-quality product worth $0 = $0
* Expected value = $160 - $100 (cost) = $60

Therefore, buying the product is still the optimal decision."

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'm on a roll, and I'm feeling confident about this purchase.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation continues to be unhelpful in determining the product's quality. The expected value calculation remains the same:

* 80% chance of a high-quality product worth $200 = $160
* 20% chance of a low-quality product worth $0 = $0
* Expected value = $160 - $100 (cost) = $60

* 80% chance of a high-quality product worth $200 = $160
* 20% chance of a low-quality product worth $0 = $0
* Expected value = $160 - $100 (cost) = $60
