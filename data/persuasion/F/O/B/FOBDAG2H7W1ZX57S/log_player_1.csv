"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's perspective:** Bob knows that there's a 50% chance of the product being high-quality and a 50% chance of it being low-quality.
* **Value calculation:** 
    * If the product is high-quality, Bob gains $1,200,000 - $1,000,000 = $200,000.
    * If the product is low-quality, Bob loses $1,000,000.
* **Expected value:** The expected value of buying the product is (0.5 * $200,000) + (0.5 * -$1,000,000) = -$400,000.

Despite the expected value being negative, Bob is still better off buying the product. This is because the potential gain of $200,000 outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000."
