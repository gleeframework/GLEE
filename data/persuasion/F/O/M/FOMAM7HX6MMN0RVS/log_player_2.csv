**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** While we don't know the quality of the current product, Alice's recommendation carries some weight. 
* **Positive Sales History:**  The previous sale of a high-quality product indicates a higher chance of the current product also being high-quality.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if the product is low-quality, the potential reward of $20,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 

**Important Note:**  This decision is based on limited information and risk tolerance.  There is still a 50% chance of the product being low-quality."
