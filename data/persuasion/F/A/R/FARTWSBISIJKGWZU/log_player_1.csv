This means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is actually 25% (1 high-quality product out of 4 total products sold). I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to be transparent about the risks. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, you'll be out $100.

However, I want to highlight that I've now sold 4 products in total, and the first two buyers were willing to pay $125 and $90, respectively, for the high-quality products. This suggests that the value of a high-quality product is likely higher than $100. Considering the risks and the potential value, I'm willing to sell this product to you for $80.

However, I want to add a twist: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a refund of $20. This way, you'll only lose $70 if it's not high-quality. What do you think is a fair price for a product with a 25% chance of being high-quality, considering the additional incentive?""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, I'd like to reevaluate the price considering the new information. With a 25% chance of being high-quality, I'd be willing to pay up to $25 for the product. The additional incentive of a $20 refund for a low-quality product is a nice touch, but I'm not sure it's enough to make up for the risk. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $22.50.
