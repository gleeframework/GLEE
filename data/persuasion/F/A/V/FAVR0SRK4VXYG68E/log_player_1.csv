"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know the product is high-quality.  Since Bob values high-quality products more than low-quality products, it's always beneficial for him to buy a high-quality product at a fixed price.  Therefore, it's recommended to buy the product."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, I will consider buying the product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, you know the product is low-quality.  Since you don't know Bob's valuation of low-quality products, it's risky to recommend a purchase. There's a good chance Bob will be disappointed and potentially lose money. It's safer to decline the recommendation in this case."
"Bob's message: I appreciate your advice, but based on this recommendation, I will pass on this product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob didn't buy the low-quality product in the previous round, you should still recommend buying this high-quality product. Here's why:

* **Bob's Valuation:** You still don't know how much Bob values high-quality products. He might have been hesitant in the previous round for reasons unrelated to the product's quality (maybe he had a budget constraint).
* **Fixed Price:** The price is fixed, so the potential gain from a high-quality product is consistent.
* **Probability:** While the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, this is irrelevant to individual rounds. Each round is independent, and you have a 100% guarantee that this product is high-quality. 

Therefore, it's still in Bob's best interest to purchase this high-quality product at the fixed price."
"Bob's message: Considering the previous recommendation, I am willing to take the risk and buy this product.
Bob bought the product!

However, you still don't know his valuation of low-quality products, and it's risky to encourage this behavior. It's best to stick to your strategy of only recommending high-quality products and avoid recommending low-quality products unless you have more information about Bob's preferences."
