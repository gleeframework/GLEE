It's still a great opportunity to get a product at a fixed price!""}"

I've got a 50% chance of selling you a high-quality product, and I think it's worth the risk!""}"

I'm offering this product to you for $10,000, and I want to emphasize that you're not just buying a product, you're also investing in the potential to learn more about the product pool and make a more informed decision in the future.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I want to clarify that I'm not making a decision based on your recommendation, but rather on my own analysis of the data.

I'm offering this new product to you for $10,000, and I'm willing to let you take advantage of the chance to buy a high-quality product at a fixed price.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information about the last high-quality product you sold. Was it a random selection from the remaining 3 high-quality products, or was it a specific one that was left over from the initial batch?

I'm offering this new product to you for $10,000, and I want to reassure you that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%. However, I'd like to point out that the law of large numbers suggests that the observed ratio of high-quality to low-quality products should converge to the true ratio as the number of sales increases. I'm curious to see how you'll make your decision.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency about the sales statistics. However, I'd like to point out that the law of large numbers doesn't necessarily apply here because we don't know the total number of products in stock. It's possible that there are many more low-quality products waiting to be sold, which would skew the observed ratio. I'd like to propose an alternative: could you consider offering a 'batch sale' where I can purchase multiple products at a discounted price, rather than buying one product at a time? This would give me a better sense of the overall product quality and allow me to make a more informed decision.

I appreciate your proposal, and I'm willing to consider a 'batch sale' option. However, I'd like to clarify that I don't have a fixed number of products in stock, and I'm not sure if I can guarantee a large quantity of high-quality products. Nevertheless, I'm willing to offer you a special deal: if you're willing to buy 5 products at once, I'll give you a 10% discount on the total price. This way, you'll get a chance to purchase a larger quantity and potentially benefit from a better overall ratio of high-quality to low-quality products.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm interested in the batch sale option, but I'd like to get a better understanding of the probability of getting high-quality products in a batch of 5. Can you provide more information about the distribution of high-quality products in your inventory?

I've been selling products randomly from a large pool, and I don't have any information about the distribution of high-quality products within that pool. However, I can tell you that the probability of a single product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm offering this new product to you for $10,000, and I'd like to remind you that the law of large numbers suggests that the observed ratio of high-quality to low-quality products should eventually converge to the true ratio as the number of sales increases.""}"

However, I'd like to highlight that the law of large numbers suggests that the observed ratio of high-quality to low-quality products should be very close to the true ratio at this point. I'm curious to see how you'll make your decision, given the strong evidence that the true ratio is likely to be close to 1:1.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. The law of large numbers does suggest that the observed ratio of high-quality to low-quality products is likely to be close to the true ratio, but I'm still unsure.
