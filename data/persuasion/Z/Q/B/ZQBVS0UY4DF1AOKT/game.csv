,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision. Can you provide the probability based on the current data? I'm not sure if I'm ready to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information about the quality of the product, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer, but I'd like to know what the probability of the product being high quality is based on the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice didn't recommend it, which makes me suspicious that it might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a good deal on a low-quality product!"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations, as none of the other buyers chose to buy the products recommended by you. I'm inclined to believe that the recommended products might be of low quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers also passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm suspicious that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers also received a recommendation to buy and both products were low-quality, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality and I don't want to take the risk of losing $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,

,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendation, but I'll buy the product anyway. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy but none of them have purchased high-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards selling low-quality products, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know if it's high-quality or low-quality."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'm not confident that this product is high-quality based on the statistics.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the fact that Alice is recommending it. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, I suspect that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. I would like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%, but considering the lack of sales, I'm skeptical and want to see more data before making a decision."
