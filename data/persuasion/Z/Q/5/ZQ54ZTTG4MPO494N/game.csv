low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I don't have any information to go on, so I'll have to rely on the fact that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'm hesitant to buy a product based on Alice's recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the products are low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious to see if I get a high-quality product despite your recommendation against it. I'm not relying on your recommendation, but rather my own probability assessment."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share the data with me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that 3 out of 3 products were low quality, I think the probability of the product being high quality is higher than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea based on the statistics. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't buy the product after your recommendation, I'm starting to think that your recommendation might be based on the product being low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to see if it's high-quality or not."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. This suggests to me that the product is likely low quality, so I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and since no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'd like to pass on this one to see if I can get a better sense of the distribution of quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to make my own decision based on the statistics and my own risk assessment."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is not a good indicator of the product's quality, given the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 0.5, since no high-quality products have been sold so far, and I'm the 10th buyer. If I pass, it will be discarded, so I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have also passed on the product, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. It's possible that the low-quality products are just a fluke, and I might get lucky with this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality, but given that none of the previous 11 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought, it's likely that the products they were offered were low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
