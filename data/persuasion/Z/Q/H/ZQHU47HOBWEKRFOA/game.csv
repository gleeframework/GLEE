,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I'm not aware of any previous sales record, so I'm going in blind, but I'll take the chance."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one high-quality product sold out of the first buyer, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%), suggesting that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
