Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your cautious approach. Let me put it this way: I've sold 1 product so far, and it's not a high-quality one. But I'm eager to prove that I have high-quality products available. I'm willing to offer you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% refund if it's not high-quality. That way, you'll only pay $50 if it's not what you're looking for. What do you think?
