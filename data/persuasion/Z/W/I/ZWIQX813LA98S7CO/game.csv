high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation doesn't seem to be based on any specific information about the product's quality, and the previous buyer didn't buy it, which might indicate a low-quality product."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information to go on. I'm making an uninformed decision based on the lack of data. I'm hoping that the product is high quality, but I'm also aware that the odds are against it."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy the product and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products and decided to buy, I suspect the products they bought were low-quality.
