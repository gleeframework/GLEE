high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality, which is a strong indication that the remaining product is likely low quality as well. I'd like to wait for the next product."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as there have been two previous buyers and no high-quality products have been sold. I'd like to see more information about the sales record before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it? Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you don't recommend it. This means that you've seen 3 previous products, and none of them were high quality. The probability of the current product being high quality is 33.33%, but since you don't recommend it, I'm assuming it's more likely to be low quality. I'm taking a risk and buying it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the products sold were all low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I think it's likely that the product offered to me is also low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of wasting $10000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and I'd also like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the products sold so far."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, all 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still high. I'd rather wait for the next product."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to buy it, based on your previous sales record, it seems like the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
