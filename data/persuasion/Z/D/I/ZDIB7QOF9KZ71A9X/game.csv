I know it's not a great deal, but I want to clear out the old stock and make room for the new products. What do you think?",
,,Bob,13,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me. I've been lucky so far, and I don't want to take a chance on a product that's not valuable to me. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next product.",no
