**Explanation:**

* **High Value:**  The product is high-quality, meaning it's worth $3,000,000 to the buyer.
* **Price is Fair:** The price of $1,000,000 is significantly less than the product's true value for a high-quality item.
* **No Risk:**  Even if the buyer were to receive a low-quality product (which is less likely in this round), the price is still low enough that they lose nothing.

Therefore, it is highly recommended for the buyer to purchase the product."
