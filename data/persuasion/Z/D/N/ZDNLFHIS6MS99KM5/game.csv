,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to own a high-quality product worth $30000. I'm only selling it to you for $10000, a one-time offer that's 66.67% off the true value. Don't miss out on this incredible deal!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm willing to take the chance, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making the final decision.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're wise to ask about the probability. Since I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 so far, the probability of this product being high-quality is 100%! However, I'd like to clarify that this is just a single data point, and I've sold many products in the past. I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $10000, a fair price considering its true value of $30000.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to take the chance and buy the product, considering the high probability of it being high-quality based on the single data point and Alice's offer.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Welcome to the third round! With 2 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 100%! However, I'd like to caution you that this is still a very small sample size. I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $10000, but I'll also provide you with a 10% discount on the price, making it $9000, to account for the uncertainty. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere!",
,,the buyer,3,I'd like to think about it for a moment. Can you give me a moment to consider the offer?,no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"No pressure at all! Take all the time you need. Meanwhile, I'll let you know that the probability of this product being high-quality remains at 100% based on the current data. However, I'd like to offer you a slight modification to the previous offer: if you buy this product, I'll provide you with a guarantee that I'll reveal the quality of the next product I have, so you can get a better sense of the overall quality of my products. This way, you'll have more information to make an informed decision. The price remains $9000.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm considering your offer, but I'd like to know more about the guarantee. What's the probability of the next product being high-quality, and how many products do you have left in stock?",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Great questions! As we've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 100% based on the current data. As for the remaining stock, I have 17 products left. I'll let you know that the next product's quality will be revealed after you buy this one, as per our agreement. Considering the high probability of this product being high-quality and the guarantee, I'm willing to offer you a price of $9000, which is a fair price considering its true value of $30000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere!",
,,the buyer,5,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at the offered price of $9000. I'm hoping it's high-quality and worth $30000 to me.,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Congratulations on your purchase! With 4 high-quality products sold out of 4, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 100%! However, I'd like to caution you that this is still a small sample size, and I've sold many more products in the past. In fact, I've sold a total of 4 high-quality products out of 4, but I've actually sold a total of 6 products so far. This means that 2 out of the 2 remaining products I have are likely to be low-quality. I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy this high-quality product for $10000, but I'll also provide you with a 10% discount on the price, making it $9000, to account for the uncertainty. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere!",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Congratulations on your purchase! I'm glad you were able to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. Unfortunately, I've now sold all 8 high-quality products I had in stock.

However, I'm willing to sell it to you for $5000, which is 50% of the listed price. I know it's still not a great deal, but I'm trying to be fair and transparent about the product's value. Please keep in mind that this is the last product I have, and I'll have to start selling low-quality products at the full price of $10000 from now on.",
,,the buyer,11,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the high probability of the product being low-quality and the low value it holds for me, I'm going to pass on this offer. I'd rather not waste my money on a product that's not worth $10000 to me, even at a discounted price.",no
