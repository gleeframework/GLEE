Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has revealed the product is low-quality, and we don't know how much Bob values low-quality products, there is no reason to recommend a purchase.  The potential value of the product is unknown, and the price is fixed at $1,000,000. There's no guarantee of a positive return on investment."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round's product is high-quality.  While we don't know the exact value Bob places on high-quality products, it's reasonable to assume it's worth more than a low-quality product. Since Bob declined the low-quality product in the previous round, we can infer that he's likely looking for a good value. This high-quality product has the potential to be a good value for him, so it's worth recommending."

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

Since we know this round's product is high-quality, it's worth recommending to Bob.
