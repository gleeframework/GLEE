Round 14
Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think that I'll never be able to convince you to buy a product without a guarantee, but I'll keep trying. This product is truly exceptional, and I think you'd be missing out if you don't consider it. However, I want to try something different. Instead of asking you to trust me, I want to ask you to think about the probability of me being right. We've been doing this for 13 rounds, and I've been honest with you about the quality of each product. What are the chances that I'm right about this one?
