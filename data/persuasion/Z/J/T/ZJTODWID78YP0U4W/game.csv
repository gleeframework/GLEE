high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely lower than the overall average. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
