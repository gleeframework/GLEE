high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data on the previous sale, such as the quality of the product and the recommendation Alice gave before. I'm not convinced that this product is high quality based on the recommendation alone."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I would like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, the probability of the product being high quality is 50%, but Alice's recommendation suggests she thinks it's likely low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't give me much confidence in its quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards high-quality products since she has already sold one high-quality product out of two sales, which suggests a 50% success rate. Given the 50/50 chance of a product being high-quality, I think it's more likely that the next product will be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $10000."

,,Alice,15,yes,
