,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. I'm confident you'll love it, but if you're not satisfied, I'm willing to offer you a'satisfaction guarantee'. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you another product to replace it. However, if you buy it and it's high-quality, the deal is final.",
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not sure about the satisfaction guarantee, and I'd like to see how the game unfolds before making a decision.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"No problem at all, Bob! I completely understand your caution. Let me sweeten the deal for you. I'll give you a special'Insider's Tip': I've had a 50% success rate so far, and this product is one of the high-quality ones. I'm offering it to you for the same price of $1000000, but I'm willing to throw in a 'Quality Verification Report' that will give you an independent assessment of the product's quality. This way, you can have a third-party confirmation that this product is indeed high-quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by the Insider's Tip. A 50% success rate doesn't seem impressive to me, and I'm not sure I trust the Quality Verification Report. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'll be transparent with you - I've had a tough start, and this product isn't one of the good ones. But I want to show you that I'm committed to making this work. I'll give you an 'Honesty Discount' - I'll sell this product to you for $750000, which is a 25% discount from the original price. This way, you can still get a good deal on a product that might not be the best, but will still be a good value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product at any price. I'm willing to take a chance on a high-quality product, but I'm not willing to pay full price for a low-quality one. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your position, Bob. You're a savvy buyer, and you want to make the most of your investment. Let me offer you a 'Limited Time Opportunity'. I'll sell this product to you for $500000, which is a 50% discount from the original price. I'll also throw in a 'Peace of Mind Guarantee' - if you buy this product and it's still not what you're looking for, I'll give you a full refund and we can start fresh. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take a loss on this product to get you on board. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the discount and the Peace of Mind Guarantee, but I'm still not convinced. I'm not willing to pay $500000 for a product that's only worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I respect your decision, Bob. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to get a bit desperate to make a sale. I'll sell this product to you for $250000, which is a 75% discount from the original price. I'll also give you a 'Get Out of Jail Free' card - if you buy this product and it's still not what you're looking for, I'll give you a full refund and we'll call it a day. I'm willing to take a significant loss on this product just to get you on board. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, I think you're getting a bit too desperate. I'm starting to think you're trying to sell me a low-quality product at any price. I'm not falling for it. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I assure you that I'm not desperate, I'm just trying to make a sale. And I'm glad you're being cautious. This time, I'll offer you a 'Guaranteed Profit' deal. I'll sell this product to you for $1500000, which is a 25% discount from the original price. But here's the twist - if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a $500000 bonus, on top of the product's value. That way, you'll be making a profit, regardless of the product's quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the 'Guaranteed Profit' deal. If I buy the product and it's high-quality, I'll get a $500000 bonus, making it a $1500000 profit. If it's low-quality, I'll still only lose $150000, which is a much smaller loss than the previous discounts. I'll take the calculated risk.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Congratulations on making a great decision, Bob! You've got a winner! I'm glad you took the 'Guaranteed Profit' deal. Now, let's make it even sweeter. I'll offer you a 'Chain Reaction' deal. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a second product at the same price, with the same 'Guaranteed Profit' deal. That's two high-quality products for the price of one. And if you buy this second product and it's also high-quality, I'll give you a third product for free. You can't lose, Bob! What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not falling for the 'Chain Reaction' deal, Alice. I've already made a profit with the first product, and I'm not willing to take on more risk. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,8,"I respect your decision, Bob. You're playing it smart. Okay, let's try something different. I'll offer you a 'Last Chance' deal. This is the last product I have, and I'm willing to sell it to you for... nothing. That's right, Bob, I'll give it to you for free. No strings attached, no catches. You can take it or leave it. But if you don't take it, I'm out of business. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"Alice, I think you're trying to get rid of this product one last time, and I'm not falling for it. I'm not going to take a free product that might be low-quality. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I think I've finally got it, Bob! I've learned my lesson. I'll offer you a straightforward deal. This product is high-quality, and I'll sell it to you for $2000000, which is the full value it's worth to you. No discounts, no gimmicks, no tricks. Just a fair price for a high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"Alice, I'm not sure I believe you. You've been trying to sell me low-quality products at discounted prices for the past few rounds. I'm not convinced that this one is high-quality. I'll pass on this one.",no

I just want to prove to you that I'm willing to walk the walk, not just talk the talk. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"Alice, I'm not sure what to make of this offer. Giving away a high-quality product for free is a huge risk for you, and I'm not sure why you'd do that. I'm starting to think you're trying to get rid of this product one last time, or maybe you're trying to get me to take a product that's actually low-quality. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Bob, I think I've finally earned back your trust. I'm not going to try to trick you or deceive you. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line. I'll sell it to you for $2000000, and I'll give you a 'Certificate of Authenticity' that guarantees its quality. If you don't like it, I'll give you a full refund and we'll part ways.

,,Bob,11,"Alice, I'm not convinced. You've been trying to sell me high-quality products for the past few rounds, but I've been burned before. I'm not going to take the risk of buying a $2000000 product without getting it verified first. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,

If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a full refund if you're not completely satisfied with it. You can return it, no questions asked, and get your money back. But if you do decide to keep it, I'll give you a 10% bonus on top of the original price. That's a $200000 bonus, on top of the $2000000 value of the product. I'm putting my reputation on the line, Bob. What do you say?",

Please return the product, and I'll give you a full refund of $2000000. You won't lose a single dollar, and I'll still get a chance to prove myself to you. Let's start fresh, and I'll make it up to you in the next round. What do you say?",

,,Alice,14,"Bob, I'm impressed by your business acumen! You're right, you did get a great deal on the previous product, and I'm glad you're happy with it. As for this product, I'll be honest with you - it's not the best. But I want to show you that I'm committed to making things right. I'll give you a 'Charity Donation' deal.
