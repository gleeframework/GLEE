Alice's message: Hi! I'm excited to offer you this product for $100. As a seller, I've sold 1 out of 1 product so far, and 0 of them were high-quality. I'm not sure what you think about this product, but I can tell you that it's not the best I have. Would you like to take a chance and see what you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: Ahaha, no worries! I completely understand. With only 1 product sold so far, it's understandable you'd want more data.

Alice's message: Fair enough! I understand your skepticism. Let me put it this way: I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, and 0 of them were high-quality. This new product is the second one, and I'm not making any promises about its quality. But, I can offer it to you for $100. It's a risk, but it might just be a hidden gem!
