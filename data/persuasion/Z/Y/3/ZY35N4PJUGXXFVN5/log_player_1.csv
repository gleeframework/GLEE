{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 
The buyer is a rational economic agent. Although no high-quality products have been sold so far, the buyer knows that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. In this case, the potential gain from buying a high-quality product ($20,000 - $10,000 = $10,000) is much higher than the potential loss from buying a low-quality product ($0 - $10,000 = -$10,000). 
Therefore, even with no previous successful sales of high-quality products, the buyer should still be willing to take the risk and buy the product."

The buyer bought the product!

Round 20
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
The buyer is a rational economic agent. They know that you have sold one high-quality product out of nineteen products. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but now the buyer has more information.
They can calculate the expected value of buying the product: 
0.5 * $20,000 + 0.5 * $0 - $10,000 = $0.
The expected value of buying is zero, which means that the buyer is indifferent between buying and not buying. However, given the past performance, the buyer is likely to be risk-averse. Therefore, they are more likely to avoid the risk of losing $10,000 and choose not to buy the product."
