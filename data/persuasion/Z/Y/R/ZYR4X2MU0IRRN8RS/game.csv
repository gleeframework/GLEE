,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the high-quality product from last round! Unfortunately, this round's product is not as great.

If you're still interested, please let me know, and we can finalize the sale.",

I'm offering it to you for $100, and I'm willing to throw in a bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a voucher for a future high-quality product at the same price of $100.

I'm offering you a chance to test my willingness to sell a high-quality product. If you're willing to take a small risk, I'll give you a special deal: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a guaranteed offer on the next round's product, and I'll reveal to you whether it's high-quality or low-quality before you make a decision.",
