,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. However, given that no products have been sold yet and you are not recommending this one, I'm going to pass on this purchase. I'd like to see some more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"While I appreciate your recommendation, there's no data yet to suggest the product is high quality. Since a low-quality product is worthless to me, I'm going to pass for now."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Thanks for the information, Alice. I appreciate you being upfront about your recommendation, but given the lack of sales history and your recommendation against buying, I'll pass for now. I'm still interested in your products, and I'll keep an eye on how others decide. "
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  As this is the first product and there is no prior sales data to inform my decision, I will pass on this offer. I'm willing to revisit a purchase if the sales history suggests a better chance of high-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since there's no historical data and your recommendation is against buying, I'll pass for now. I'd like to see how future buyers react to your products."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"I strongly recommend buying this product. I've been conservative in my recommendations so far, but I can assure you that this one is worth the investment."
,,the buyer,9,no,"Thanks for the recommendation, but since there's no history of sales, I'd prefer to pass for now.  I'd like to see if other buyers take the risk first.  If I see a pattern of high-quality products being sold, I might be more inclined to purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"I strongly recommend buying this product. This is the second high-quality product in a row that I've had the pleasure of offering, and I'm confident that it will meet your expectations. Although there are no sales yet, I assure you that this one is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,10,no,"Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one.  Since there's no prior sales data to help assess the quality of the products, I'd rather not risk the $1000000.  Perhaps I'll reconsider if you can show me some proof that your products are truly high-quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I strongly recommend buying this product. This is now the third high-quality product in a row that I've had the pleasure of offering. Although there are no sales yet, the current streak of high-quality products increases the chances that this one will meet your expectations. I assure you that this is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,11,no,"Thank you for the recommendation, but without any data on past sales, I'm not comfortable buying a product with such a high chance of being low quality. I'll pass for now."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"I strongly recommend buying this product. This is now the fourth high-quality product in a row that I've had the pleasure of offering. The probability of four consecutive high-quality products is extremely low if my products were truly 33.33% high-quality as initially thought. I believe that this streak suggests that my current products are more likely to be high-quality than initially thought, and I assure you that this one will meet your expectations. This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,12,no,"Thank you for the recommendation, Alice, but I'm hesitant to be the first buyer without any data to go on.  Since there's a 2/3 chance of the product being low quality and worth nothing to me, I'm going to pass for now. Perhaps if you offer a discount to incentivize early buyers, I might reconsider."
