{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No track record:** You still have no sales history to build trust with the buyer. 
* **Low-quality product:** You know this product is low-quality, and there's no way to convince the buyer otherwise at this point. 
* **High price:** The $10,000 price is a significant barrier, especially with the current lack of trust. 

It's best to avoid recommending the product and wait for future rounds where you can potentially build a better reputation."

* **Low-quality product:**  There's no reason to recommend a low-quality product, especially with the current lack of trust.
