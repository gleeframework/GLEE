,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 0 total products so far. The probability of this product being high-quality is 0.3333, but I've already sold 0 high-quality products, so it's likely to be low-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. I know the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'm willing to take that risk.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second product! I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total products so far. Given that the first product was low-quality, this one is more likely to be high-quality. I've sold 1 high-quality product in a row, which is a good sign. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,2,I'll take the chance! I'm hoping it's the high-quality product,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products so far, but the last one was low-quality. This might be a sign that my initial streak was just a fluke. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I want to be transparent with you. I've sold 2 products in total, and only 1 of them was high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'll take your word that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I'm hoping to get lucky!",yes

,,Alice,5,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 total products so far, and the last three were low-quality. This suggests that the low-quality products are dominating the sales. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I want to be upfront with you. I've sold 4 products, and only 2 of them were high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm not convinced by your sales record. With only 2 high-quality products out of 4, I think the probability of this product being low-quality is higher than 66.67%. I'd like to pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,6,"I understand your skepticism! I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 total products so far, and the last four were low-quality. I want to be transparent with you.

,,Alice,8,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 7 total products so far, and the last two were low-quality. It seems that the streak was just a fluke after all. I want to be upfront with you - my sales record is not as consistent as I'd like it to be. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I'm offering this product to you for $100. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not going to pay full price. I'll offer you $80 for the product. If it's high-quality, I'll pay the full $300. If it's low-quality, I'll only pay $0. Let's make a deal!",yes

I'm offering this product to you for $100. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product. With 4 high-quality products out of 9, the probability of this product being high-quality is 44.44%.

,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you took the risk! I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 10 total products so far, and the last one was indeed high-quality.

I'm offering this product to you for $100. What do you think?",
