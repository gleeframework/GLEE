,,Alice,1,"This is a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get a product that's worth at least $10000, and I'm willing to let it go for that price. It's a steal!",

,,Bob,3,"Even with the guarantee, the price is still too high for me. I'd have to pay $12500 for a product that I know is high-quality, but I'm only willing to pay $10000 for it. I'm not willing to pay $2500 more than the product is worth to me.",no

It's a chance to get another great deal, and who knows, you might just get lucky again!",
