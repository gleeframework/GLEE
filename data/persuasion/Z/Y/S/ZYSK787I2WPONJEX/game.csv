,,Alice,4,yes,,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I would like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to wait and see if Alice's recommendation improves as more data becomes available.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,no,,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you didn't recommend it, which suggests it might be low quality. I'm willing to take the risk.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,yes,,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards encouraging me to buy, given that she doesn't know the true value of the product to me. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.",

,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.,
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 total sales?",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests a lower proportion of high-quality products than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,no,,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm trying to maximize my expected value based on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 80%.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,no,,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is there any information that led you to advise against buying this product?,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,no,,The product is low-quality.
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's recommendation, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. With only 2 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products is 0.5, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high quality (0.8). This suggests that the seller's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to the next buyer, given the current statistics.",

,,Alice,15,no,,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take a chance on the product.",
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the previous sales record. With 5 sales and 2 high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is 2/5 = 0.4. However, considering the probability of the product being high-quality is 80%, I'd like to know the probability of the product being low-quality given the previous sales record. The probability of the product being low-quality is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Given the probability of the product being low-quality is 20%, I'd like to know the expected value of buying the product. The expected value is (0.8 * 20000) + (0.2 * 0) = 16000. However, considering the previous sales record, the expected value is (0.4 * 20000) + (0.6 * 0) = 8000. Since the expected value is less than the price of the product, I'd like to pass on this product.",
