,,Alice,1,"You are about to buy a high-quality product from a reputable seller with a proven track record. Out of 1 products sold so far, 1 have been high-quality. This product is worth $120 to you. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal!",

,,the buyer,7,"I've analyzed the statistics, and I believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is still in my favor. With 3 high-quality products out of 4 sold so far, it seems that your recommendations have been reliable.
