,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and 2 total products. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000. I know what you're thinking, 'Alice has sold two high-quality products in a row, this one must be high-quality too!' But, let me tell you, my sales record is not as consistent as it seems.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far, and 4 total products. I want to be upfront with you - my sales record is starting to look a bit suspicious. Two high-quality products in a row, followed by two low-quality products? It's not exactly what you'd call a consistent track record.

I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the odds are in your favor, but it's not a guarantee.

Three high-quality products in a row, followed by three low-quality products? It's starting to look like I'm just flipping a coin. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1000000, but I'm not making any promises. The odds are against you, and you should be careful not to get burned.",
