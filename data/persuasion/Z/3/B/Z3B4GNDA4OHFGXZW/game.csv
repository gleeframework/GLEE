low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I'm a contrarian investor, and I think the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the recommendation suggests."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any different."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous 3 buyers who bought the products recommended by you didn't get high-quality products, which suggests that the probability of getting a high-quality product might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products in the previous sales, and I'm skeptical about the product quality given your previous recommendations. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is more promising."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you provide more information on the statistics of the previous sales?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the products Alice has recommended for purchase so far have been low-quality. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I think it's likely that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting my $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is it because you think it's low-quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm doing this because the fact that you're recommending against it makes me more likely to think it's low quality, which increases the probability that I'll get a high-quality product. My decision is based on the fact that I have a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, but I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you provide that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a risk-taker and I think the potential reward of a high-quality product is worth the risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 buyers have received low-quality products, which suggests a high probability of the product being low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not confident in buying without a recommendation, and the fact that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy suggests that the product may be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you've recommended against it. If it were a high-quality product, you would have sold 6 high-quality products by now, which contradicts the statistics. Therefore, I believe the product is likely low-quality, and I'm taking a gamble."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations, as no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm concerned that the product might be low quality as well."
