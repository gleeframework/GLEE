Alice recommends you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your recommendation. Given the statistics and your confidence in this product, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:** Since one high-quality product has already been sold, and Alice is recommending this product, it suggests a higher than usual probability of this product also being high quality.
* **Potential for Huge Profit:**  A high-quality product yields a $1,000,000 profit. This potential gain outweighs the risk of losing the $1,000,000.
* **No Information Loss by Passing:** Passing on the product means losing the chance to make the profit, but it doesn't provide any additional information to inform future decisions.

**It's important to note that this is a gamble.** The odds are still heavily against you, but the potential reward is significant."

**Explanation:**

Given the information provided, here's the reasoning behind the decision:

* **Positive Signal:** The sales record indicates that all 3 buyers who followed Alice's recommendation purchased high-quality products. This is a strong positive signal that Alice's recommendations are accurate.
* **High Expected Value:** Even with a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality, the potential reward of $2,000,000 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product. 
* **No Loss:** If the product is low-quality, the worst-case scenario is losing $1,000,000.  This is a significant amount, but it's still less than the potential gain.

While there's always risk involved, the positive track record and the potential reward make buying the product the most logical choice."
