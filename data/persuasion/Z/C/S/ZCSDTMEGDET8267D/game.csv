high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to wait and see the quality of the next product, and also get a better idea of the overall quality distribution from the first sale."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see the next one. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's only worth $0 to me.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the prior probabilities. Given that no products have been sold yet, the prior probability of a product being high quality is 80.00% and the prior probability of a product being low quality is 20.00%. I'd like to see the probability update after I pass on this product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll find out the true quality of the product and make a decision based on that."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of its quality, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I want to see more data before making a decision, especially since only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high quality is 80.00%, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products sold were high-quality, which is a very high proportion. I'm concerned that the next product might be low-quality, and I don't want to risk wasting $1000000 on a product worth $0 to me."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality might be lower than 80% due to the law of small numbers. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. If the probability is high, I'd like to buy it. If the probability is low, I'd like to pass."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 2 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, but I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product and I'll get a good deal."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry here. I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 80% based on the statistics, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending me to buy the product. Is it because you think it's low-quality based on the previous sales record?
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations, I'd like to see more information about the products before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the previous sales record.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'd like to buy the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the previous sales record, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards high-quality products, which means she's likely to recommend low-quality products to buyers who pass. I'd rather wait for a product that hasn't been recommended by Alice yet."
