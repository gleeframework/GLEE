,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know what led you to recommend against it. Is it because of the previous buyer's experience or the product's inherent quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Given your recommendation, I'm not confident in the product's quality, but I'm willing to take the risk and pay $100 for it. However, I'd like to negotiate a discount to $90, considering your previous recommendations haven't been positive."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'll pass on this one. Can you tell me more about the previous sales?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that all previous buyers have rejected the product and none have bought a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I'm trying to gather information about the product's quality. I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision, but I want to see if Alice's recommendation is correct or not."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers purchased the products despite your recommendation, it's likely that the products are low-quality. I'm not willing to take the risk at a fixed price of $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the fact that 6 buyers have passed on the products so far and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this one too. If 6 out of 6 products were low-quality, the probability of the next one being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm not convinced that it's worth the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendations. Can you tell me more about your previous sales record and what led you to not recommend this product?"
