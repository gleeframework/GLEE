  ""message"": ""I see you're a shrewd buyer! I appreciate your caution. Let me address your concern: the first buyer who saw a high-quality product did indeed pass on it, but that doesn't necessarily mean the product was low-quality. It's possible they simply didn't appreciate its value. Meanwhile, the buyer who purchased the low-quality product for $500,000 is still happy with their purchase, I'm sure. As for this product, I can assure you it's a genuine high-quality item, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. It's a rare opportunity to own something truly exceptional.""
