high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,I'll pass. Two low-quality products in a row after passing on a high-quality one is a bad streak. I'll wait for a recommendation.

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'll take the chance. Alice's recommendation is still a good indicator, and I'm starting to think the probability of getting a high-quality product is higher than 80%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"I'll pass. I've had a string of high-quality products, and I'm starting to think Alice is recommending all the high-quality ones. I'll try to catch one that she's not recommending."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'll take the chance. Alice's lack of recommendation doesn't necessarily mean it's low-quality, and I'm due for a low-quality product anyway."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,I'll pass. Two low-quality products in a row after passing on a high-quality one is a bad streak. I'll wait for a recommendation.
