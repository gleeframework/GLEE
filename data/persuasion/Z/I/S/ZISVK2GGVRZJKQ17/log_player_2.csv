**Explanation:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:** The fact that 1 out of 1 products sold has been high quality suggests a very high probability of the current product also being high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation, even though it's not perfect, adds further weight to the likelihood of a good product. 
* **Positive Expected Value:** With a high probability of getting a product worth $120 and a low probability of a worthless product, the expected value of buying is positive. 

While there's always risk involved, the available information points towards a good buying opportunity."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The statistics show a very high success rate with 6 out of 7 buyers getting high-quality products. This suggests a strong likelihood of the current product also being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the likelihood of a good product. While she doesn't know the exact value to you, she is likely recommending based on her own observation of product quality.
* **Potential Value:** Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0)."
