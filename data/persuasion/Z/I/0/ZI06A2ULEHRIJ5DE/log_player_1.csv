Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
Since Bob has not purchased any products yet, he likely believes all products are low-quality.  It's still not in Bob's best interest to purchase at this point, as the expected value is negative:

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.3333 * $300) + (0.6667 * $0) = $100**

Even though this product is high quality, the expected value is still less than the price ($100). Bob is better off waiting and seeing if the seller starts recommending higher-quality products."
