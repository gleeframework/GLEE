,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'm also worried that if I pass, the product might be high-quality and go to waste. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer who bought a product? Did they get a high-quality or low-quality product?"

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping for a high-quality product and I don't want to pass on it to the next buyer."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and Alice's recommendation is against it. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'd like to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the probability of it being high-quality, not on your recommendation."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have found a high-quality product. I suspect that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%, so I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the product and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to see the next product, if possible."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the product is low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the current statistics. Can you share the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 6, which is 0%. This suggests that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous buyers who received a recommendation to buy also bought the product, and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is likely based on the product being low-quality, as there's a 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
