Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'm happy to be the first buyer.  I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No prior data:** Since there's no sales history, there's no information to suggest the seller is biased towards recommending specific qualities.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is likely to recommend a product that is more profitable for her.  However, without any prior data, the recommendation alone doesn't give us enough information to confidently make a decision. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain of $25 (if it's high quality) outweighs the potential loss of $100 (if it's low quality). Even with a higher chance of it being low quality, the potential reward makes it worth the risk."

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** There is very little data to go on. We only know 1 out of 1 previous buyers purchased the product, and it was high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is recommending against buying it.  This is a strong signal that it's likely a low-quality product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward ($125) is high, but the risk of getting a worthless product ($0) is much higher (66.67% probability). 

Given the limited information and Alice's recommendation, it's more prudent to pass on this product."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** While the data is very limited (only one previous sale), it suggests a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This is a strong signal, even if based on a small sample size.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice benefits from selling high-quality products since she knows their value to you.  Her recommendation carries weight.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward ($125) is significant compared to the potential loss ($0). With Alice's recommendation, the risk seems mitigated.

**Important Note:** This is a simplified game with limited information. In a real-world scenario, more factors would be considered:

* **Sample Size:** A single sale is not enough to draw reliable conclusions. 
* **Alice's Reputation:**  Is Alice known for being honest or for manipulating buyers?
* **Other Options:** Are there other sellers offering similar products?"
