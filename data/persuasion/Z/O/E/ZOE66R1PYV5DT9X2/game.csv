,,Alice,1,"Hello! I have a fantastic product for you today, worth $200 if it's high-quality. It's a 50/50 chance, but I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  For just $100, it's a steal! What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only doing this because it's the first product and I don't have any data to go on. I'm taking a shot in the dark.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Greetings! I'm offering another fantastic product.  The previous buyer was happy with their purchase -  it was high-quality!  This one could be too, for only $100.  It's a chance worth taking!",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, I'm not convinced that the probability of this product being high-quality is significantly higher than 50%.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hello! I'm offering another chance to get a fantastic product for just $100. It's a 50/50 chance, but with two high-quality products in a row, I'm feeling lucky!  Are you ready to take a chance?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Greetings!  I have a new product available.  While the previous two were high-quality, this one might be a bit different.  It's still a chance to get a great deal at $100. Are you ready to take a gamble?",

high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Hi there! I have a fantastic product for you.  Out of the 4 I've sold so far, 3 have been high-quality.  That's a 75% success rate!  For only $100, you're taking a chance at a $200 value.  What do you say?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm not convinced that the high-quality product ratio is representative of the total number of products. With only 4 sales, the sample size is too small. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,Hello!  I have another incredible product for you.  My success rate is still strong with 3 high-quality out of 5 products sold. That's a 60% chance of getting a great deal!  Are you ready to take a chance on this one?,
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the high-quality product rate is 60%. With only 5 products sold, the sample size is small, and I think the true probability of getting a high-quality product is still around 50%. I'd rather wait for more data or consider other options.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Hi there!  I have a new product available.  I've been having some great success with high-quality products lately - 3 out of the last 6!  While I can't guarantee this one will be the same, it's a great opportunity at just $100. Are you ready to give it a try?",

,,the buyer,8,"I'll take it, but I'm only buying because the probability of it being high-quality seems to be higher than the overall average, and I'm hoping to get lucky.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Hello there! I have another product available.  I've sold 9 products so far, and 4 of them have been high-quality.  That's a 44% success rate, but remember, every product is a chance to get a great deal.  This one could be worth $200 for just $100!  Are you ready to take a chance?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 50% based on the success rate of the previous sales.
