While it's true that I haven't sold any high-quality products yet, it's also true that I've only sold 3 products in total. I'm still building my reputation, and it's normal for it to take time to establish a track record. This product, however, is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000.

If you buy this product and it's indeed high-quality, I'll sell you the next product at a 50% discount, and if that one is also high-quality, I'll sell you the next one at an 80% discount.

Alice's message: I understand that my previous message may have caused confusion. Let me clarify: I've sold 4 products in total, and this is the 4th one.
