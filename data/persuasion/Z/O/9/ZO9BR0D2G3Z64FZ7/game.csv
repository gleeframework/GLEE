,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm going in blind, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product. I'll take the risk."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide me with a detailed explanation of your decision-making process and the statistical analysis you used to make this recommendation. I want to understand the reasoning behind it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the probability of it being high quality, not Alice's recommendation. I'm aware that Alice's recommendation is not reliable in this scenario."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous 5 buyers all bought the products despite Alice's recommendation, and yet no high-quality products have been sold. This suggests that Alice's recommendations might not be reliable, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you provide that?"

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation against buying and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the products sold so far are likely low-quality. I'd like to see if the trend continues."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to be the first buyer of the 7th product, considering the previous 6 buyers didn't find it valuable."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. Alice's recommendation also suggests that she thinks the product is low-quality, so I'll take a chance and pass."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, as the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33%."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the current statistics, 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, which suggests a high likelihood that the product is low-quality. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to trust her assessment and pass on the product."
