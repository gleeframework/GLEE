high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'm not going to buy the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know that you're not recommending it, so I'm hoping it's a low-quality product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you didn't recommend it, which suggests it might be a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous two buyers purchased the product, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products recommended were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products and no high-quality products were sold, I'm concerned that this product might be low quality as well. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. With 2 low-quality products sold and 2 total products sold, I'd like to calculate the probability of the next product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, but I'm curious, Alice, what makes you think it's not worth buying?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have received low-quality products, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that if you don't recommend it, there's a good chance it's low-quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems like the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd rather wait for a recommendation that might indicate a higher chance of a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm going to take a chance despite your recommendation, Alice. I'm not convinced that you have any information that I don't have, and I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because you think the product is low-quality based on past sales data?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm the 4th buyer, and I know that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far. Given the low number of sales, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that you don't recommend it and the statistics suggest a high proportion of low-quality products have been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not sure if I should buy a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low quality, especially after seeing the previous buyers didn't find it worth buying. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record and your thought process behind not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the fact that you're not recommending it, which might imply it's low quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
