I'm willing to be transparent: I've been selling these products for a while now, and I'm starting to think that there might be a systemic issue with our selection process. I'm willing to offer you a 'insurance policy' of sorts: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a $5000 bonus on top of the $10000 refund.
