Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, I can tell. You've seen that I've already sold one product. I'll give you a hint: the first product sold was indeed high-quality. That's a 33.33% chance, but I've already broken the streak. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I'm willing to give you a chance to be the one to benefit from it.
