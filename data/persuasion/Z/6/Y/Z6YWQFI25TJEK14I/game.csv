,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm not sure what to expect."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that the first buyer purchased the product after your recommendation, it's possible that the product is high-quality. However, the probability of this happening is only 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information about the quality of the products yet, and I'm concerned that the first buyer may have been lucky to get a high-quality product. I'd like to wait and see if more data becomes available before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'd like to see more data on the quality of the products before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, I'd like to know the statistics of the previous buyer who bought the product and what happened after they bought it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1 product, the proportion of high-quality products is 100%. This is a very high proportion, and I'm not sure if this is a representative sample. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, there's only 1 high-quality product out of 1 sold, which is a very low proportion. I'm not convinced that this product is high quality, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or just a random guess. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the first buyer purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products is indeed higher."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the product and see the result of the first buyer's purchase before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,

,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product. Was it high-quality?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 100%. This is likely due to chance. I'm not convinced that this is a reliable indicator of the product's quality, and I don't want to buy a potentially low-quality product for $100."
