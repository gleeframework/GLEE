,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I don't have any information to go on and Alice's recommendation is neutral. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still high, and I don't want to pass on it and let it be discarded. I'm aware that Alice's recommendation doesn't carry any weight, but I'm hoping for a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far might be due to chance, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it and 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems likely that this product might be low quality. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation seems suspiciously optimistic given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyers didn't buy based on your recommendations, and I'm not sure what the probability of a high-quality product is. I'd like to take the risk and see if I get a high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 previous buyers, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, as the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000, which is 1/3 of its potential value to me. I'd like to know the quality of the product after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the current data. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 0. Based on this information, I would like to pass on the current product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, 6 out of 7 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, which suggests that the products recommended by Alice are likely to be low-quality. I will pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm curious about the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have passed on the product and none have been sold, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low. I'd like to wait and see if the pattern continues."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take the risk."
