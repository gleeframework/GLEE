}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in buying it at this price. I'm willing to pay $20000 for a high-quality product, and I don't know what I'm getting. Can you tell me the quality of the product?

Plus, I'll throw in a special guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund. What do you say?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not buying it. I already know that 66.67% of your products are low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of paying $10000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'm not interested in your guarantee, as I don't think it changes the fact that I don't know the product's quality beforehand.

}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your transparency, but the discount doesn't change the fact that I don't know the product's quality beforehand.

}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $10000 for a product that might be low-quality. I'd rather wait and see the quality of the next product.

I'm willing to give you that assurance right now. I'll tell you the quality of the product, and if it's high-quality, you can buy it at the discounted price of $10,000. If it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, just like before. What do you say?""

This way, you can wait and see the quality of the next product before making a decision. What do you say?""
}"
