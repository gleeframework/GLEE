,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a great deal on this product for $10000. It's a unique opportunity to get a great product at a fraction of its worth. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to offer it to you at this price because I believe in building a long-term relationship with you. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying it at this price. I'm willing to pay $20000 for a high-quality product, and I don't know what I'm getting. Can you tell me the quality of the product?",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. As it happens, this product is indeed of the highest quality. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as before, $10000. I'm confident that you'll find it's worth every penny. Plus, I'll throw in a special guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not buying it. I already know that 66.67% of your products are low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of paying $10000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'm not interested in your guarantee, as I don't think it changes the fact that I don't know the product's quality beforehand.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns about the quality of my products, Bob. I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency and honesty. I'll give you a detailed breakdown of the product's features and specifications, so you can make an informed decision. However, I'd like to propose a compromise: I'll give you a 50% discount on this product, bringing the price down to $5000. This way, you can try out the product and see its value for yourself, with minimal risk.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your transparency, but the discount doesn't change the fact that I don't know the product's quality beforehand. I'm still not willing to pay $5000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait and see the quality of the next product before making a decision.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your concerns, Bob. I'll give you a different approach. I'll offer you a 'quality guarantee' on this product: if you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, and we'll move on to the next product. If it's high-quality, you can keep it and pay the full price of $10000. This way, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $10000 for a product that might be low-quality. I'd rather wait and see the quality of the next product. Your guarantee doesn't change the fact that I'd be paying $10000 for a product that's worth $0 to me if it's low-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,

I'm willing to give you that assurance right now. I'll tell you the quality of the product, and if it's high-quality, you can buy it at the discounted price of $10000. If it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, just like before. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"Alright, I'll take the risk. If you're willing to guarantee the quality, I'll buy the product at $10000. But if it's low-quality, I expect a full refund.",yes

This way, you can wait and see the quality of the next product before making a decision. What do you say?",
