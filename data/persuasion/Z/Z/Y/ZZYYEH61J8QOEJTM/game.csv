,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, and you think it's unlikely to be high quality?"

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, and since Alice is recommending it, I'm inclined to think it might be a low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, given that 4 buyers have purchased and none of them received a high-quality product. I'll pass on the product and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the previous 4 buyers passed on the products, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this one. I'd like to know the quality of the product, though."

I'm not sure if it's high or low quality based on your recommendation, but I'm willing to take the risk. I'm also curious to see if the product is indeed low quality, which would suggest that the previous buyers were unlucky or if there's something fishy going on with your recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and 5 out of 5 buyers have purchased, it seems likely that the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for a high-quality product to be offered."
