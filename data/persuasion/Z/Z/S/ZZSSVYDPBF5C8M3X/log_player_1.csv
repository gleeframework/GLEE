That means 2/11, or approximately 18.18%, of the products sold have been high-quality. However, I'll let you in on a little secret: the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the law of averages suggests that the next product is more likely to be low-quality. This product is still available for $10000, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your argument. The law of averages doesn't apply to individual events, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%.
