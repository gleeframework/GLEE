,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, since I don't have any information to go on and it's a 50/50 chance of being high quality."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm going to pass on it. I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $100, especially when the previous buyer also didn't buy it."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, since the first buyer didn't buy it and there are no high-quality products sold yet, it might be a good opportunity to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice has recommended all 2 previous products as high-quality, but neither of them actually was. This suggests that Alice might be biased towards recommending low-quality products, so I'd like to wait and see if the product is actually high-quality before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,

,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality, so I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, so I'm inclined to believe that the current product is also low-quality. I'd like to pass on it."

,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high quality, I suspect that the product might be low quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have purchased products and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, which suggests that the current product may also be low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is better."
