,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'm not convinced yet, I'd like to see some data first. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold given that no products have been sold yet? I want to make an informed decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, and I'm willing to take a chance on the first product."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that you don't recommend it. I'll buy the product and see what happens."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards encouraging sales, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer gets a better offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the logic behind your recommendation? Is it based on the previous sales record or something else?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low quality, and I'm not convinced that this one is high quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is better."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products and no high-quality products have been sold, I think the probability of the current product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product and I'll get it for $1000000, which is a good deal compared to the expected value of a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far and the total number of products sold so far before making a final decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product. This suggests that the previous products may have been low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products offered so far have been low quality. I'd like to wait for a new product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if there are 4 other buyers who purchased products with no high-quality ones being sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 4 buyers having purchased and no high-quality products sold, it seems the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the average, so I'm inclined to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,

,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products recommended by you were low-quality, which suggests a strong bias in your recommendations. I'm not convinced to buy the product based on your advice."

,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious about the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? And also, can you explain your recommendation? Is it based on the proportion of high-quality products sold or something else?"
