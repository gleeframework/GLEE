low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm offering you a product that I think you might not have seen before. It's a bit of a gamble, but I'm willing to let it go for the same price as before, $10000. I'm curious to see if you'll take a chance on it.",
,,Bob,2,"I'll pass, I'm not taking any risks for the same price as before.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've got another high-quality product that I think you'll really like. I've taken into account your previous decision, and I'm willing to offer you a slight discount to $9500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take it, but I'm only doing it because I think the discount is worth it.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've got another high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price as the last one, $9500. However, I want to make it clear that I think this product is even better than the last one, and I'm willing to stand by its quality. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,I'm not paying the same price for a product that you claim is better than the last one. I'll pass.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm willing to sell you this product for a significantly lower price of $5000. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I want to be transparent about its quality. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it, and I'll be honest with you, it's not the best product I have, but it's still a good deal.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not convinced that it's a good deal, especially considering the last product was also high-quality and I paid the same price for it. I'll pass.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've got another high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you at a price that reflects its value. I'm thinking of $8000, which is a significant discount from the original price.

,,Bob,6,"I'll take it, but I'm still not convinced that you're not trying to take advantage of me with your pricing strategy.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I want to be upfront with you, Bob. I've noticed you've been skeptical of my pricing, and I appreciate your caution. With this product, I'm not asking for the full $10000. I'm willing to let it go for $6000. It's a genuine low-quality product, and I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it at this price.",
,,Bob,7,I'm not falling for the low price on a low-quality product. I'm not going to pay $6000 for something that's only worth $0 to me.,no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've been paying attention to our previous interactions, and I think I can offer you a more transparent approach. I'll give you a price that's based on what I think you're willing to pay for a high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $8500. If you don't like it, I'll be willing to negotiate further, but I think this is a fair price for something of this quality.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not willing to pay $8500 for a product that you claim is high-quality, especially since you've been trying to sell me low-quality products at the same price as high-quality ones.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm not going to try to sell you on the quality of this product. I'll be honest with you, it's a low-quality item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000, which is a very low price. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I think you can see the value in it. It's a chance to get something for a fraction of its 'worth'.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not going to pay $2000 for something that's worth $0 to me. It's not a good deal for me, and I'm not going to take the risk.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm willing to take a different approach. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $8500, but I'll also throw in a guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll buy it back from you for $5000. That way, you have nothing to lose, and I'm willing to take on the risk. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because of the guarantee. I'm not convinced that the product is worth $8500, but the option to sell it back to you for $5000 makes it more appealing.",yes

However, I'm willing to give you an even better deal than before. I'll sell it to you for $1000, and I'll also throw in a small gift, a product of equal or lesser value, absolutely free. It's a chance to get something for almost nothing.",
