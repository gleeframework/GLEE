,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as the first buyer, I'll take the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the lack of information from the previous buyer's purchase. I'm hoping that the product might be high quality, and I'm willing to take the risk. However, I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information about the previous buyer's decision and the quality of the product they purchased, as this would help me make a more informed decision in the future."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I think it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, as you don't know my valuation and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, it is likely that the product is of low quality. I will pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers who accepted the recommendation bought the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended by Alice are likely to be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation based on the current statistics, but I'd like to know more. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products you've sold so far?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she hasn't sold any high-quality products yet, so it's likely she's trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if Alice's recommendation changes."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales to make a more informed decision in the future."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the products are mostly low-quality. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm even more skeptical. I'll pass on this product to see if the next buyer will have a better luck."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
