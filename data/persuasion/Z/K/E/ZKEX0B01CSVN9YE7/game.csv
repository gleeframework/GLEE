This product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, which would be worth $12500 to you. Don't miss out on this chance to potentially make a great profit! What do you say?",

There haven't been many high-quality sales yet, but that doesn't mean this one isn't. It's all about risk and reward, and this could be your chance to be one of the first to capitalize on a potentially high-value product.  What's your decision?",

However, the product is only worth $12500 to me and I have to pay $10000 for it.
