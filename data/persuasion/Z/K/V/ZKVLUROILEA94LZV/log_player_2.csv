I'd like to share a statistic that might be helpful: the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, and the probability of the current streak being a coincidence is actually quite high. In fact, if we assume that the quality of each product is independent, the probability of getting 4 high-quality products in a row is around 42%. This means that it's actually more likely that the current streak is a coincidence than a sign of a consistent quality trend. Would you like to take a chance on this high-quality product for $10000?

Alice's message: I'm impressed by your statistical thinking! You're absolutely right to consider the law of small numbers and the possibility of random fluctuation.
