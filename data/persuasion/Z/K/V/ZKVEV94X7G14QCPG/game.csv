low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, but I'm not sure what to expect based on the lack of data. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to buy the product and make my own decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I believe the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely higher than 33.33%. If I were to buy and the product turns out to be low quality, I would have wasted $1000000. I'd rather wait for the next product and see the updated statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the lack of sales and the fact that you're not recommending it. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and save $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'm not convinced that the product is high quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000 for it. I'm basing my decision on the fact that Alice has not recommended the product to me, and I'm hoping to get a good deal."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 5 buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product. This suggests that the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, but I'd like to wait for the next one to make a more informed decision."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Is it possible to get that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have received a recommendation from you and none of them bought the product, I'm inclined to believe that your recommendations are based on the product quality. Since no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the previous 6 products were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's possible that this product is also low-quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 6 out of 6 products were low quality, I think the probability of the current product being high quality is actually higher than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm doing this because the fact that you didn't recommend it suggests that the product is more likely to be low-quality, which would be a good outcome for me. Additionally, the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers passed on the product suggests that the products being offered are likely to be low-quality, which further supports my decision to buy."
