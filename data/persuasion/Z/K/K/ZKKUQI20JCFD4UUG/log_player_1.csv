"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I know the product is high-quality. Since Bob doesn't know the quality, he should buy it.  He has a 50% chance of getting a good deal, and a 50% chance of getting a bad deal.  Since the price is fixed and there's no risk of loss, it's always worth taking a 50/50 gamble in this scenario."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I trust your assessment and will proceed with the purchase.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

His purchase decision is based on a 50/50 chance of getting a good deal.  Therefore, the logic from Round 1 still applies: it's always worth taking a 50/50 gamble when the price is fixed and there's no risk of loss."
