,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'd like to see the outcome of the first sale to get a better idea of the product's quality."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as there's no prior information to go by."

,,Alice,6,yes,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the product has a 80.00% chance of being high quality and I'd like to take that risk."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, given that no high-quality products have been sold so far. Can I see the statistics again?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope for the best."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, the proportion of high-quality products is likely to be lower than the true probability of 80%. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity or more information."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if all 3 previous buyers got low-quality products and bought them, the probability of this product being low-quality is higher than the overall probability, which could indicate a bias in the sample. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that all the products sold so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I'm not convinced that it's high-quality based on the statistics. Out of 3 previous buyers, none of the products were high-quality, which suggests that the product might be low-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the products sold so far have been low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the current statistics. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. Given the probability of a product being low-quality is 20%, the probability that all 3 previous products were low-quality is (0.2)^3 = 0.008. This is a very low probability. It's likely that at least one of the previous products was high-quality, and since none were purchased, the probability of the current product being high-quality given the previous sales record is higher than the base probability of 0.8. I would like to pass on the current product and see if the next buyer gets a better recommendation."
