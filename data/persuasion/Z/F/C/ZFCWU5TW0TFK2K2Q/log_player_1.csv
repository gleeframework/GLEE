The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. However, I'd like to point out that the last two products sold were both high-quality, which suggests that I might be more likely to have a high-quality product available next. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000, and I think it's a good opportunity to get a high-quality product.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the probability of it being high-quality, which is 80%.

I can tell you that the distribution of the previous 9 products is fairly even, with 5 high-quality and 4 low-quality. However, I did notice that the 4 low-quality products are clustered together in the first 4 products, and the 5 high-quality products are more spread out. This might suggest that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually higher than 80% after the first 4 products.
