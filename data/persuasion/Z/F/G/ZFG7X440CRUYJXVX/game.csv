,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information about the product's quality yet, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the chance to find out."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation. I'm concerned that this product might be low quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation given the low success rate so far. Can you tell me more about the products you've sold to the previous buyers?
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the products, I suspect that the products are mostly low quality. I'm going to pass on this one as well."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm willing to take the risk and hope that this one might be high quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers received low-quality products (since no high-quality products have been sold), I'm concerned that the product I'm offered might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality. I think it's likely that the product is low-quality and I don't want to take the risk of wasting my $100."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I suspect that the products sold so far were all low-quality. If I buy, I'll be the 4th buyer to be recommended to buy, and I don't want to take on the risk of getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation.

high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it might mean it's low quality."
