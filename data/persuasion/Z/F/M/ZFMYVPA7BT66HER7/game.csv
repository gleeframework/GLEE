high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the statistics, it seems that all products sold so far have been low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer is more optimistic."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is low. I'd rather not risk buying a low-quality product for $100."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm going to assume the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. Since you don't recommend it, I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping it's the first high-quality product of the day."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous 5 buyers didn't find any high-quality products, I'm skeptical about the current product's quality. I'd like to know the updated statistics before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm not going to take the risk given Alice's recommendation and the low sales of high-quality products so far.

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your past sales record and how you make your recommendations?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be based on any information, and I'm not sure if she has any information that I don't have. I'm buying it in the hopes that it's a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Given that 7 buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous 7 buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This makes me think that the probability of the product being high-quality is low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation from you, Alice. Can you tell me more about the product's quality based on the statistics?"
