,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you one bit! But let me ask you, have you ever heard the phrase 'the exception that proves the rule'? Well, I think this product is that exception. I've been selling low-quality products, but this one... this one is different. I'm not saying it's high-quality, but it's definitely not low-quality. And at $1000000, it's a risk worth taking. Think about it, you could be the one who breaks the streak and gets the best deal of the century! What do you say? Are you ready to take the plunge?",
