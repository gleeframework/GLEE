Alice's message: I'm glad you're happy with your purchase! This is the fourth product, and I'm excited to tell you that it's also a high-quality one, worth $12000 to you! However, I want to be transparent with you - I've already sold one high-quality product, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is now lower. I'm offering it to you for $10000, and I think it's still a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take it! I'm feeling lucky and I think the probability of another high-quality product is still relatively high.""}"

Round 5
Alice's message: You're on a roll! However, this one's not as lucky. Unfortunately, this is a low-quality product, worth $0 to you. I want to be upfront with you - with two high-quality products sold already, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now lower than it was earlier. I'm offering it to you for $10000, but I have to warn you, it's a bit of a risk. I'm hoping you'll take a chance, but I understand if you'd rather wait for the next one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not feeling lucky anymore. I think the probability of another high-quality product is too low, and I don't want to waste $10,000 on a low-quality product.""}"

Round 6
Alice's message: I completely understand your concerns. This is the sixth product, and I'm afraid it's another low-quality one. I want to be transparent with you - with two high-quality products sold and three low-quality ones, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now very low. I'm offering it to you for $10000, but I have to admit, it's a long shot. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll give you a small concession: I'll throw in a guarantee that if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund on the next product you buy from me, no questions asked.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still not willing to take the risk. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the probability of a high-quality product increases again.""}"

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand your caution. This is the seventh product, and unfortunately, it's another low-quality one. I want to be upfront with you - with three low-quality products in a row, the probability of the next product being high-quality is extremely low. However, I'm willing to make a stronger offer to try to persuade you. I'll give you a 50/50 chance to buy this product for $8000, and if it turns out to be low-quality, you can walk away with a full refund, no questions asked. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it.

Round 8
Alice's message: I understand your decision. This is the eighth product, and I'm afraid it's another low-quality one. I want to be honest with you - with four low-quality products in a row, the probability of the next product being high-quality is extremely low, and it's getting harder for me to keep offering you deals. I'm willing to make a final offer: I'll sell you this product for $6000, and if it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, and I'll also throw in a bonus - I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me, no matter what its quality is. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping you'll take it.

I want to be transparent with you - with five low-quality products in a row, the probability of the next product being high-quality is extremely low, and I'm starting to run out of options. I'm willing to make a desperation offer: I'll sell you this product for $4000, and if it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, and I'll also throw in a 20% discount on the next product you buy from me, no matter what its quality is. This is my last, last offer. If you don't take it, I'll have to start over from scratch with a new set of products.

I want to be blunt with you - with six low-quality products in a row, the probability of the next product being high-quality is essentially zero. I'm not going to make any more offers or try to persuade you to buy this one. I'm just going to give it to you for $2000, and you can take it or leave it. If you don't take it, I'll have to start over from scratch with a new set of products, and you'll have to start from square one.
