,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'll buy the product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy it and there are no high-quality products sold yet. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite the low success rate so far."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous two products were high-quality, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the fact that 2 buyers have already been recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems like the products recommended to buy so far have been low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all products sold so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for a higher proportion of high-quality products to be sold before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product, since you've recommended 0 high-quality products out of 2, I'm going to assume the probability of the product being high quality is still 50% and the probability of it being low quality is still 50%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and Alice has recommended 3 products to other buyers, it's likely that the products are low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to give me a 10% discount, considering the fact that 3 previous buyers were not satisfied with the products and none of them were high-quality. If I don't get a discount, I'll have to pass on it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Given that none of the previous products have been high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this one being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that all previous products were low-quality, which suggests a possible bias towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems that the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of them were high quality, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is there a reason you've seen a pattern in previous sales that I'm not aware of?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. Given the lack of evidence of high-quality products being sold, I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not buying based on your previous recommendations. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, it seems like the products that have been sold so far are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
