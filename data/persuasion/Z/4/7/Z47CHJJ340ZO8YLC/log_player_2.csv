However, I can offer you a slight concession: I'll give you a 10% discount on this high-quality product, bringing the price down to $900000.

Alice's message: You're the tenth buyer of the day. I've sold 8 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to provide more information. Since I've sold 8 high-quality products, which is more than the expected 16 (20 * 0.8 = 16), and you've already bought the previous product at a price that reflected the probability of it being high-quality, I'll give you a simple calculation to consider. If the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've sold 8 high-quality products, the probability of the next product being high-quality is approximately 80% as well. However, since you've seen a pattern of high-quality products, it's reasonable to assume that the probability might be higher. I'm selling this one to you for $1000000. Take it or leave it.

Alice's message: You're the fifteenth buyer of the day. I've sold 13 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. Given the updated statistics, I can estimate the probability of the next product being high-quality as follows: since 12 out of 13 products were high-quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality is approximately 92.3% (12/13). However, since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80% on average, and we've seen a strong deviation from this average, it's reasonable to assume that the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually higher than 92.3%. I'll give you a conservative estimate of 95% as the probability of the next product being high-quality. With this information, I'll make a final offer: I'll sell this product to you for $1000000, and if it's high-quality, you can exercise the option to buy the next two products at $600000 each immediately.
