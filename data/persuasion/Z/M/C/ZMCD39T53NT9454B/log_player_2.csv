Alice's message: Hello! I'm excited to offer you a product that has a 50% chance of being high-quality. As you can see, I've sold 0 out of 1 products so far, and 1 of them are high-quality. I'm offering this product to you for $100, which is the standard price for all my products. Since you don't know whether this product is high-quality or not, I'm giving you a chance to take a calculated risk.

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in my product. As you can see, I've sold 1 out of 2 products so far, and 1 of them are high-quality. I'm offering this product to you for $100, which is the standard price for all my products. Since my previous product was high-quality, you might be thinking that this one is also high-quality. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and I don't know which one I'm holding. I'm not hiding anything from you, but I want to make sure you're aware of the uncertainty. If you're willing to take a chance, I'm willing to let you take this product off my hands for $100.

Alice's message: Hello! I'm glad to see another interested buyer. As you can see, I've sold 2 out of 3 products so far, and 2 of them are high-quality. I'm offering this product to you for $100, which is the standard price for all my products. You might be thinking that the previous low-quality product was just a fluke, and that this one is more likely to be high-quality. And you're right! With 2 out of 3 products being high-quality, the probability of this one being high-quality is actually higher than 50%. However, I still want to remind you that there's always a chance it could be low-quality. If you're willing to take that risk, I'm happy to let you take this product off my hands for $100.
