,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm a risk-taker and I'd like to see if I can beat the odds."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were low-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me might be lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see the outcome for myself and update my understanding of the product's quality based on the result."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. What is the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not buying. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't buy the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'm not willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you can do better next time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers. This suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality might be lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product to get more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is significantly lower than the 33.33% probability of a product being high-quality. I'm going to take a chance and pass on the product, hoping that the next one will be high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation is not a decisive factor in my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product, I'm assuming it's more likely to be low-quality. Given the low-quality products have a 66.67% chance, I'm going to pass on the product to avoid the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/4, which is 0%. This is significantly lower than the expected 33.33%. I'm inclined to believe that the products sold so far were low-quality, and I'd rather wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your previous recommendations. I'm not convinced it's high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, as 4 buyers have been sold products and none of them were high-quality. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and I'd rather not risk wasting my money."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm not going to take the risk with the current information. I'd like to see more data on the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low quality, the probability of this product being high quality is likely lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. I'd appreciate it if you could share the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that you're not recommending it, and the 4 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
