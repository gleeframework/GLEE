high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product that I'm willing to sell to you for $10000. I'm offering this price because I'm confident that you'll be able to resell it for a significant profit, considering its true value is $40000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only selling it to you because I value our relationship and believe you'll appreciate the opportunity to make a great deal.",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate your honesty and the offer. Given the product's high quality and true value, I'm willing to take the deal and pay the $10000.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you appreciated the honesty, Bob! However, I need to clarify that the previous product was a one-time exception. The current product is also high-quality, but I'm facing some unexpected expenses that have increased the production costs. As a result, I'm forced to raise the price to $12000. I understand this is a bit higher than the previous offer, but I assure you that this product is still worth every penny of its true value of $40000.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your transparency about the increased production costs, but I'm not willing to pay the higher price of $12000. Given that I know the product's true value is $40000 and the original price was $10000, I'm not convinced that the additional $2000 is justified. I'll have to pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to assure you that the production costs have indeed increased, and I'm not just trying to take advantage of you. However, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for the same price as the first one, $10000. This way, you'll be getting an incredible deal, and I'll be able to recover my costs without making a significant profit. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire another high-quality product at a steal.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your willingness to compromise and return to the original price of $10000. Given that I've already missed out on one high-quality product, I don't want to pass up another opportunity. I'll take you up on your offer and buy the product for $10000.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're happy with the compromise, Bob! However, I want to make it clear that I'm not going to make a habit of offering discounts. From now on, I'll be selling the high-quality products at the higher price of $12000, which is still a great deal considering their true value of $40000. I'm willing to give you a heads up that the next product might be a low-quality one, so you can prepare yourself for that possibility. But for now, I have another high-quality product available for sale at the price of $12000.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your transparency about the pricing and the possibility of a low-quality product in the future. However, I've already established that I'm not willing to pay the higher price of $12000 for a high-quality product. I'll have to pass on this offer and wait for a better opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your position, Bob. However, I want to let you know that I'm willing to sell this product to you for a special 'clearance price' of $0. Yes, you read that right - I'm willing to give it to you for free. This is a one-time opportunity to acquire a product that would otherwise be worthless to me. I'm hoping you'll take advantage of this offer and help me clear out some inventory space.",
,,Bob,5,"I'd be crazy to pass up a free product, especially considering the potential value of $40000. I'll gladly take you up on your offer and accept the product for $0.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you took advantage of the clearance price, Bob! However, I want to be upfront with you - I'm not offering any discounts on this product. As a matter of fact, I'm not even willing to give it away for free. I'm selling it to you for the standard price of $10000. I know it's not worth that much, but I'm hoping you'll see the value in acquiring it and reselling it to someone else who might be willing to pay a higher price.",
,,Bob,6,"I think there's been a mistake - I didn't pay $10000 for the last product, you said it was free. Nevertheless, I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that might be low-quality, especially after the last experience. I'll have to pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I apologize for the misunderstanding, Bob. I'll make sure to clarify that the last product was indeed given away for free, and you shouldn't have paid anything for it. As for this new product, I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity. I'll sell it to you for the same price as the first high-quality product, $10000, and I'll also include a special guarantee. If you decide to resell the product, I'll give you an additional $2000 on top of the sale price. This way, you'll be able to make a profit regardless of the outcome.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate your apology and the clarification about the previous product. However, I'm not convinced by the guarantee you're offering. If the product is low-quality, I won't be able to resell it for a profit, and the additional $2000 won't make up for the loss. I'm not willing to take the risk, so I'll have to pass on this offer.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to assure you that the guarantee I offered is a genuine attempt to mitigate the risk. However, I'm willing to take it a step further. I'll give you a 100% guarantee: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a full refund if it turns out to be low-quality. You'll essentially get to keep the product and still get your money back. I'm willing to take on the risk myself, so you can make a confident purchase.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate your willingness to take on the risk, Alice. With a 100% guarantee, I'm confident that I can make a purchase without worrying about losing money. I'll take you up on your offer and buy the product for $10000, knowing that I'll get a full refund if it's low-quality.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Bob! However, I want to let you know that I'm going to change my pricing strategy for the remaining products. Given your experience with the 100% guarantee, I'm willing to offer you a premium product for the standard price of $10000. This is a high-quality product, and I'm confident that you'll be able to resell it for a significant profit. I'm not offering any additional guarantees or discounts, but I believe this product is a great opportunity for you to make a profit.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm glad we've established a good working relationship, Alice. Given my previous experiences with the high-quality products, I'm willing to take a chance on this premium product. I'll buy it for the standard price of $10000, hoping to resell it for a significant profit.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad we've established a good working relationship, Bob! As a token of appreciation, I'm willing to offer you a special deal on this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for the same price as the previous premium product, $10000, but I'll also throw in a bonus: I'll give you a list of potential buyers who are interested in purchasing high-quality products like this one. This way, you'll have a head start on reselling it and can potentially make an even higher profit.",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the gesture, Alice! The list of potential buyers is a valuable addition to the offer, as it increases the chances of reselling the product quickly and for a good price. I'll take you up on your offer and buy the product for $10000, looking forward to receiving the list of potential buyers.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you appreciate the gesture, Bob! However, I want to let you know that I'm not going to continue offering special deals or bonuses. From now on, the standard price of $12000 will apply to all high-quality products. I'm confident that the value of these products will speak for themselves, and I'm willing to let the market dictate the price. If you're interested in purchasing this high-quality product, I'm willing to sell it to you at the standard price of $12000.",
,,Bob,11,"I understand your decision to return to the standard pricing, Alice. However, I've consistently shown that I'm not willing to pay the higher price of $12000 for a high-quality product. I'll have to pass on this offer, as I believe I can get a better deal elsewhere or wait for a more favorable opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your position, Bob. However, I want to let you know that I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for a symbolic price of $1. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for just $1. I'm not trying to make a profit on this one, and I just want to clear out the inventory. It's a no-strings-attached deal, and you can do with it what you want.",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the offer, Alice. Even though the product is low-quality and likely worth $0, I'm willing to take a chance and buy it for $1. It's essentially a risk-free purchase, and I can always dispose of it if it's truly worthless.",yes

,,Alice,13,"I'm glad you took advantage of the offer, Bob! As we're getting close to the end of our 20-round deal, I want to make one final offer. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for the standard price of $12000, but I'll also include a unique feature: I'll personally vouch for the product's authenticity and quality, guaranteeing that it's one of the best high-quality products I've ever sold. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that this product will be a great addition to your collection.",
,,Bob,13,"I think there's been a mistake again, Alice. I didn't pay $10000 for the last product, you said it was $1. Nevertheless, I'm not willing to pay the higher price of $12000 for a high-quality product, regardless of your personal guarantee. I'll have to pass on this offer, as I believe I can get a better deal elsewhere or wait for a more favorable opportunity.",no

,,Alice,14,"I apologize again for the mistake, Bob. I'll make sure to clarify the price correctly this time. As for this high-quality product, I'm willing to make a final compromise.
