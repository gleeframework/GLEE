However, I also want to be honest with you - this product is indeed a low-quality one. I'm not trying to hide it from you. In fact, I'm offering it to you at a significantly lower price than usual, just $8,000, because I know it's not up to my usual standards. I'm willing to take a loss on this one to demonstrate my commitment to transparency and honesty.""
}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty about the product's quality, and I commend you for being transparent about it.

"Bob's message: I appreciate the creative offer, but I'm not interested in participating in a lottery that requires me to pay $10000 for a low-quality product.
