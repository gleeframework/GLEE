Keep in mind that the law of large numbers is starting to kick in, and the probability of a high-quality product is likely closer to 50% than ever. Don't miss out on this opportunity!""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not convinced by the law of large numbers argument. With only 4 products sold, the sample size is still relatively small, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not convinced. With only 5 products sold, the sample size is still relatively small, and I don't want to jump to conclusions about the probability of a high-quality product. I'd like to wait and see more data before making a decision.

It's a risk, but it might be a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount.""}"
