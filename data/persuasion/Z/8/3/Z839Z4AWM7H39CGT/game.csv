Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product, the probability of the product being high-quality is 0.8, but since Alice has recommended it, I'm going to assume she has some information that I don't. If she's recommending it, it's likely that she knows it's a low-quality product and is trying to get me to buy it. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."
