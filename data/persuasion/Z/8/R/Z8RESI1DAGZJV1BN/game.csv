,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm buying the product!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, given the low sales record so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, the probability of the current product being high quality is higher than the overall probability. I'd like to see the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, is there any reason behind your recommendation? Is there a pattern or a strategy I should be aware of?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. Can you tell me how many potential buyers there have been so far and how many high-quality products were sold out of the total number of products sold?
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as I think the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall 33.33% chance. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product I'm offered might be low-quality. Is there any information that suggests otherwise? And what is your recommendation based on?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one. I'll wait for the next one."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were low-quality, the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both were low-quality products, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality, which would mean the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not going to take the risk based on Alice's recommendation and the current statistics.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to know more about the distribution of high-quality products before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see a higher success rate before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2, and considering the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the fact that 2 previous buyers also received a recommendation to buy and none of the high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to take a cautious approach and assume that the probability of a high-quality product being recommended is lower than the overall probability of a high-quality product. Therefore, I'll pass on the current product to avoid potentially wasting $1000000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not going to buy it, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation against it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold given that no high-quality products have been sold so far?"
