,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, which would make me the lucky buyer of the first high-quality product sold."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, I'm suspicious that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to buyers. I'd like to see more data or get a different recommendation before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality and the probability of it being low quality, based on the previous sales record."

,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low quality, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high quality is higher than the overall probability of 80%. I'd rather wait for a new product or get more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all the previous buyers received low-quality products, which is consistent with the 20% chance of low-quality products. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality and not worth the $10000 price tag. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
