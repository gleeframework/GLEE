"Bob's message: Since the product has a 50% chance of being either high or low quality and you know its true quality but I don't, I'm at a disadvantage. Your recommendation doesn't provide any new information about the product's quality. I won't buy without more reliable information.

```"
"Bob's message: Your message, while reassuring, doesn't change the underlying probability of the product being high or low quality.

```"
"Bob's message: Your descriptions, while enticing, don't provide any verifiable information about the product's quality. Given the 50% chance of it being low-quality and the lack of concrete evidence or a change in price, I remain unconvinced. I need a more reliable basis for making a decision.
