high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I'm the first buyer and there's no data to go by. I'm hoping for a high-quality product!"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 100%. However, this is likely due to chance, and I'm concerned that the sample size is too small to make a reliable inference about the overall quality of the products. I'd like to wait and see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, the probability of the current product being low quality seems higher than the overall probability. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 1 out of 1 product was high-quality, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 80%. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 out of 1 product was high-quality, the probability of the product being low-quality is 20%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. I'd like to know the quality of the product, but I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Can you tell me the quality of the product and the number of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since only one high-quality product has been sold so far, and I'm not sure if that's just a lucky draw."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far, I'm not confident that the probability of the product being high-quality is high enough to justify the purchase price of $100."
