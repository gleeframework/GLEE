Alice's message: Ahah, nice catch! You're wondering about the quality, huh? Well, I'll let you in on a little secret: I've sold 2 out of 4 products so far, and 0 of them were high-quality. It's clear that I'm having a streak of low-quality products, but who knows, maybe this one will surprise you? It's still $100, and it's a unique opportunity to get a product that's... well, not the best. What do you think?
