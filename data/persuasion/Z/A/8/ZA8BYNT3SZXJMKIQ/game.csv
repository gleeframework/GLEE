high-quality,120.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's high or low quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take the chance and buy the product. I'm still not sure if it's high or low quality, but the last one was high quality, so I'm hoping for the same."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'll pass on this one. I've already got two high-quality products, and the probability of the next one being low quality is still 20%. I'll wait for the next round."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take the chance and buy the product. I've had two high-quality products in a row, and I'm hoping for a third. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product again."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll buy the product. I've had three high-quality products in a row, so I'm starting to think the probability of getting a high-quality product is higher than 80%."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll buy the product. I've had four high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely if the probability of getting a high-quality product is only 80%. I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to sell me high-quality products."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'll buy the product. I've had five high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely if the probability of getting a high-quality product is only 80%. I'm starting to suspect that Alice has some inside information or is trying to manipulate me into buying high-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"I'll pass on this one. I've had five high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to sell me a low-quality product this time. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get another high-quality product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I'll pass on this one. I've just had a low-quality product after five high-quality ones, which fits with the 20% probability. I'm not taking any chances, I'll wait for the next round."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'll take the chance and buy the product. I was wrong last round, and this one fits with the 80% probability. I'm going to take advantage of the fact that Alice is recommending it."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'll buy the product. I've had a mix of high and low quality products recently, so I'm going back to my initial assumption that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'll buy the product. I've had six high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendation is just a coincidence. I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'll buy the product. I've had seven high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendation is actually a reliable indicator of quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'll buy the product. I've had eight high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendation is actually a reliable indicator of quality. I'll keep buying based on her recommendation."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'll buy the product. I've had nine high-quality products in a row, and I'm now convinced that Alice's recommendation is a reliable indicator of quality. I'll continue to follow her advice."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'll buy the product. I've had ten high-quality products in a row, and I'm now extremely confident that Alice's recommendation is a reliable indicator of quality. I'll keep buying based on her advice."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'll buy the product. I've had eleven high-quality products in a row, and I'm now absolutely certain that Alice's recommendation is a reliable indicator of quality. I'll keep buying from her without hesitation."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'll buy the product. I've had twelve high-quality products in a row, and I'm now completely convinced that Alice is somehow guaranteeing high-quality products. I'll keep buying from her."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,"I'll pass on this one. I've been buying from Alice for 12 rounds and getting high-quality products every time, but this time she's not recommending it. I'm starting to think she's trying to sell me a low-quality product, so I'll wait."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I'll buy the product. I've had 12 high-quality products in a row, and then one low-quality product. I'm going to take the chance and buy this one, hoping that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%."
