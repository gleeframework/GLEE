low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, since the lack of information suggests a 33.33% chance of it being high-quality, and I can't get any information from you about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product's quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you didn't recommend it, which might imply that it's more likely to be low-quality. I'm taking a risk here."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or for Alice to reconsider her recommendation."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products recommended were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, this is actually in line with the expected probability. However, the fact that all recommended products were low-quality suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not buying. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is very low. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by your recommendation based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. However, I also know that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
