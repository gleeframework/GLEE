low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I know you're a savvy buyer, and I respect that. Let me be upfront with you - this product isn't the best I have. But, I'm willing to sell it to you for a very low price: $50.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I know you've been hesitant on the lower-quality products, and I respect that. Let me ask you this: do you want to take a chance on getting a great deal on a product that might not be the best, but could still be useful to you? I'm willing to sell it to you for $50, the lowest price I've offered so far. It's a risk, but it could pay off.",

I'll make you a deal: I'll give you this product for $75, and I'll throw in a second product that's also a low-quality item. You can have both for $150, which is a steal. It's a package deal you won't want to pass up.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll sell you this product for $75, and I'll throw in a 'friend of a friend' discount. I'm basically giving you a deal that I wouldn't give to my best friend. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not going to make it any better than this. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm not going to sugarcoat it, Bob. This product is not great. But, I'm at the end of my rope here. I'll sell it to you for $0. Yes, you read that right. I'll give it to you for free. That's how desperate I am to get rid of it. It's a $100 product, and I'll give it to you for nothing. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,"Fine, I'll take it. But only because it's free.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm glad you took me up on the free offer! I'm not going to make the same mistake twice. I'll just say that this product is not worth your time or money. It's a waste of space, and I'm not going to try to sell it to you. I'll just give you a heads up: it's not good.",
,,Bob,14,"I already know it's not good, and I'm not paying for it.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,

I'm not going to make any promises or try to sweet-talk you into buying it. I'll just say that it's a high-quality product, and I think you should consider it. The price is still $100, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",
,,Bob,15,"I'll take a chance on a high-quality product, especially since you're being straightforward about it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm glad you appreciated my honesty earlier. Unfortunately, this product isn't as lucky. It's not great, and I'm not going to try to spin it for you. But, I'll give you a fair deal: I'll sell it to you for $25. That's a huge discount, and I think it's a fair price for a product that's not going to change your life. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I'm not going to give up on this one. I'll make a wild guess: I think you're a value-driven buyer, and you're looking for a deal. So, I'll give you an even lower price: $10. That's right, I'll sell you this low-quality product for 10 bucks. It's a crazy price, but I'm desperate to get rid of it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,17,"You're not getting me to pay $10 for a low-quality product, no matter how desperate you are.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'm not even going to try to sell it to you. I'll just say that this product is not worth your money, and I'm not going to waste either of our time trying to convince you otherwise. It's a low-quality product, and I'm just going to give it to you for free. That's right, I'll give it to you for nothing. Take it or leave it.",
,,Bob,18,"Fine, I'll take it. But only because it's free.",yes

I'll just say that it's a low-quality product, and I'm not going to waste my time or yours trying to convince you otherwise. I'll just give you a gift receipt and let you take it home. No pressure, no sales pitch. Just a free product that you can take or leave.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Well, I guess I've finally reached the end of the road. I'll just say that this product is low-quality, and I'm not going to try to sell it to you. I'm done. You've made it clear that you're not interested, and I respect that. I'll just pack it up and put it on a shelf somewhere. Good luck with everything, Bob.",
