,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 80.00%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping that since she didn't recommend it, the product is more likely to be low-quality, which would be a good deal for me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that you're trying to sell it. I'd like to wait and see how many more products are sold and what the proportion of high-quality products is before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see the outcome of the previous sales. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the relatively low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high, given the low number of sales so far."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
