,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like to make my decision based on the updated statistics before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,

,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be the second high-quality product, which would give me a higher chance of getting a good deal."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation. Can you provide that?

high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that the previous 3 buyers didn't have any information about the quality of the products. Given that only 1 out of 3 products was high-quality, I'm expecting a lower proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products. However, I'm still buying because I'm trying to get a sense of the true quality distribution, and my expected value is still positive."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, and considering the low overall proportion of high-quality products sold so far (2/4), I'm inclined to think it's likely a low-quality product."
