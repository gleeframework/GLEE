Alice's message: I understand your hesitation, but I want to make a case for this product. As you know, I've sold 4 products so far, and 3 of them were high-quality. That means 1 out of 4 products is low-quality, and this one just so happens to be it. But I think it's worth noting that even a low-quality product can have some redeeming qualities. It might not be worth $40000, but it could still bring some value to your life. And at $10000, it's a very affordable risk. Plus, think of it as an opportunity to practice your negotiation skills - you can always try to get a better deal or resell it later. What do you say?
