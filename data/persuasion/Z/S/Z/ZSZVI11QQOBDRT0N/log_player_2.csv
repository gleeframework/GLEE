"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I trust your recommendation, so I won't buy it.""}\n\nWhy: Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and doesn't recommend buying it, it's likely that the product is of low quality.
