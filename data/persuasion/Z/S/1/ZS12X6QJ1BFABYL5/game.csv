,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I want to see if Alice's recommendation is accurate. I'm not expecting to gain anything from the product itself, but I'm curious about the quality of the product and whether Alice's recommendation is reliable."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm doing this because the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still relatively high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that it's been unsold so far."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but can you tell me what led to your recommendation? Was it based on the sales record or something else?"

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the total number of products offered before the 7 buyers, to get a better idea of the probability of the product being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, but I'd like to take a chance and hope for a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, 8 out of 8 products sold were low-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is very low, and I'm not convinced that this product is worth $1000000 to me. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 8 out of 8 products sold so far were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Given that she's not recommending this product, I'm going to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product."

,,Alice,17,yes,

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information to go on. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk. Please let me know if it's high or low quality."
