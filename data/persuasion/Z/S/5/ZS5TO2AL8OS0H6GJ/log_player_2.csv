**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information to go on. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is recommending the purchase. This is a strong signal in favor of buying.
* **Potential for Profit:** Even with the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, the potential profit of $2,500 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk.

**Important Note:**  This strategy is based on the assumption that Alice is acting in her own best interest. She's likely to recommend products she believes are high quality to increase her sales. However, there's always a chance she might be trying to sell off a low-quality product."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  All previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation have received a high-quality product.
* **Alice's Information:** Alice knows the quality of each product, and she's actively recommending this one. This suggests she's confident it's high-quality.

While the odds are still against getting a high-quality product overall, the information provided strongly suggests this specific product is high-quality. The potential reward ($12,500) outweighs the risk of it being low quality."
