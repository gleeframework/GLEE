**Reasoning:**

* **Prior information:** The sales record shows that Alice has sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 sales. This is a 100% success rate for high-quality products.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which indicates she believes it's high quality. This is further supported by the strong success rate in the past.
* **Expected Value:** While the odds of getting a low-quality product are higher, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($400) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 

Based on the available information, the decision to buy the product has a high expected value."
