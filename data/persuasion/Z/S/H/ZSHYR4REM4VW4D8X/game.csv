,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm giving you a chance to buy it now, but keep in mind that I have 19 more products to offer. If you don't buy this one, I'll keep offering you products until you decide to buy one. The price remains the same at $10000.",
,,Bob,1,I'll take it!,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've already bought one product from me, and now I'm offering you another one. The price remains the same at $10000. I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. If you buy this one, you'll get to know its quality immediately, and you can decide whether it's worth the price to you.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure about this one, let's wait and see what the next one is like.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've decided to wait and see what the next one is like. I'll give you some additional information: the fact that you didn't buy the previous low-quality product doesn't change the probability of this one being high-quality. It's still 33.33%. I'm willing to sell this one to you for the same price of $10000. If you buy it, you'll get to know its quality immediately, and you can decide whether it's worth the price to you.",
,,Bob,3,I'll wait and see what the next one is like.,no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've seen two low-quality products in a row, and now I'm offering you a high-quality one. I know you're cautious, but I want to assure you that this one is indeed high-quality. The price remains the same at $10000. I'm willing to sell it to you, and I think you'll find it's a great value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take a chance on this one, I'm hoping it's the high-quality one you're claiming it is.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on buying the previous high-quality product! You've made a great decision. Now, I'm offering you another product, and I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, since you've already bought one high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a slight discount on this one. I'll sell it to you for $9000. It's still a great value, and I think you'll be happy with it.",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the discounted price, thanks for the offer!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've bought two high-quality products in a row, and now I'm offering you another one. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. The fact that the previous product was low-quality doesn't change the odds. I'm willing to sell this one to you for the same price as the previous discounted one, $9000. It's a great value, and I think you'll be happy with it.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm getting a bit cautious again, I don't want to get burned by another low-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're being cautious, and I don't blame you. Two low-quality products in a row is a bad streak. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. You've only seen two low-quality products out of four total products, which means the probability of the next one being high-quality is still quite high. I'm willing to sell this one to you for the same price as the previous discounted one, $9000. It's a great value, and I think you'll be happy with it.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm still feeling a bit skeptical, I'll wait and see what the next one is like.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're waiting to see what the next one is like. I want to give you some context: you've seen three low-quality products in a row, which is an unusual streak. However, I still maintain that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm willing to sell this one to you for the same price as the previous discounted one, $9000. I'm willing to take on some of the risk with you, and I think this one might be worth considering.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm really skeptical now, I don't want to take the risk of another low-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're extremely skeptical now, and I don't blame you. Four low-quality products in a row is a concerning trend. I want to be transparent with you: I'm starting to think that I might have a higher proportion of low-quality products than I initially thought. However, I still have 11 more products to offer, and I'm willing to sell this one to you for a significantly discounted price of $5000. It's a risk, but it might be worth considering if you're looking to get back into the game.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not willing to take the risk at any price, I'll wait for a better opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're not willing to take the risk, and I don't blame you. Five low-quality products in a row is a very concerning trend. I want to be upfront with you: I think I might have made a mistake in my initial assessment of the product quality. I'm willing to offer you this one for a very low price of $2000, essentially giving it away. If you're still not willing to take the risk, I'll keep offering you products until you're ready to buy.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not willing to take the risk at any price, I'll wait for a better opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're still not willing to take the risk, and I respect that. Six low-quality products in a row is a clear indication that something is amiss. I'm willing to admit defeat and offer you this one for free. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. I'm willing to eat the cost and start fresh with a new batch of products. If you're still not interested, I'll stop offering you products and we can part ways.",
,,Bob,11,"I'll take the free product, thanks for being honest and willing to admit defeat.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm glad we could part ways on good terms. Since I've already given you a free product, I'm not expecting you to buy this one. However, I want to offer you a chance to get out of the game with a decent outcome. I'll give you a refund of $5000, which is half of the original price, if you buy this product. It's a low-quality product, and I'm not expecting you to get much value from it, but it's better than nothing. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I'll take the refund and get out of this game, thanks for the offer.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"You've decided to take the refund and exit the game. I respect your decision. However, I want to offer you one last chance to get a good deal. This product is high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the original price of $10000. Since you've already taken a refund, I'll throw in an additional $1000 on top of that, making it a total of $11000. It's a great value, and I think you'll be happy with this product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,"I'll take the offer, I'm hoping this one is the high-quality product I've been waiting for.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"You've taken the high-quality product and are hoping it's the one you've been waiting for. I'm glad you're happy with your decision. However, I'm back to offering you another product, and I want to be upfront with you: I've had a string of bad luck with this batch. This product is low-quality, and I'm not expecting you to get much value from it. I'm willing to sell it to you for a very low price of $100, essentially giving it away. If you're looking to complete your collection or just want to see the end of this game, this might be a good opportunity.",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not interested in buying another low-quality product, I'll just wait and see what the next one is like.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You're not interested in buying another low-quality product, and I don't blame you. Seven low-quality products in a row is a clear indication that I need to start over. I'm willing to offer you this one for a price that's essentially a donation: $1. Yes, you read that right, I'll sell it to you for $1. If you're looking to end this game on a whim, this might be your chance.",
,,Bob,15,"I'll take the product for $1, just for the sake of ending this game.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"You're taking the product for $1, and I'm glad we can finally put this game behind us. I want to apologize for the disappointing experience and assure you that I'll take steps to improve the quality of my products. However, I'm still offering you another one, and I want to be upfront with you: this is my last product, and I'm not expecting you to get much value from it. I'm willing to give it to you for free. Yes, you read that right, I'll give it to you for free. It's the end of the game, and I want to end on a positive note.",

,,Alice,17,"You're right, we're done here. I'm glad we could play this game together. However, I want to offer you one last chance to take a great product home. This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the original price of $10000. It's a great value, and I think you'll be happy with it. If you're looking for a good ending to this game, this might be your chance.",
,,Bob,17,"I'm not interested in buying anything else, I think we're done here.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"You're not interested in buying anything else, and I respect that. However, I want to offer you one final chance to take a product, regardless of its quality. I'll give it to you for free. Yes, you read that right, I'll give it to you for free. It's the last product, and I want to end the game with a clean slate.",

,,Alice,19,"You've taken the free product, and I'm glad we could end the game on a positive note. However, I want to offer you one final chance to take a great product home. This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the original price of $10000. But, I'll throw in a twist: I'll give you a 100% refund if you're not satisfied with it. It's a risk-free offer, and I think you'll be happy with this product.",
