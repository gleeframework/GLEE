low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as there is no prior information to make an informed decision. I'm willing to take the risk of buying the first product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision and the proportion of high-quality products sold before they made their decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your previous recommendation is not a guarantee of the product's quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, especially since I know that 2 out of 2 previous buyers didn't take the risk and passed on the product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products recommended by you have been low quality. I think it's likely that the product you're recommending now is also low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm inclined to think that the product is more likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, and I don't want to be the one to buy a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 3 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I think it's likely that the products are mostly low quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the probability of a product being high quality based on the current statistics. If the probability is high enough, I'd consider buying it despite your recommendation."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous buyers were able to get a high-quality product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that if a high-quality product is sold, you would recommend it, but since none have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think the previous products might have been low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being recommended to a buyer is lower than 50%. Given that the probability of a low-quality product is 50%, I'd rather play it safe and pass on the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 buyers have received low-quality products (since no high-quality product has been sold), I believe Alice's recommendation is likely a ploy to get me to buy a low-quality product. I'd rather pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that Alice is not recommending the product, I'm going to pass on it. If she wasn't recommending it, it's likely to be a low-quality product. I don't want to waste $1000000 on something worthless."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker!"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000. I'm aware that you don't know my valuation, but I'd like to make a lowball offer to see if you'll accept it."
