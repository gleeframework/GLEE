low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high, and I don't have any information about the product's quality. I'd like to make my own decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm assuming there's a good chance it's low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold, and Alice has recommended against the product, I'm skeptical about its quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the current statistics, I'm inclined to trust her judgment. Since she doesn't recommend buying, I'll pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 3 buyers didn't buy the products after your recommendations, and that's a strong indication that the products they saw were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I think it's likely that this product is also low-quality. However, the potential reward of a high-quality product is significant ($20000), and I'm willing to take the risk to try to get it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
