,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable purchasing without more information about the product. Could you provide some additional details or perhaps a guarantee of its quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"Alice, I appreciate you not recommending this product.  Since you haven't provided any information about the products beyond your recommendations, I'm going to pass on this one as well. Could you possibly offer some way to build trust or provide more details about the products you're selling?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"Alice, I'm still hesitant.  I've seen two products now, and your recommendations haven't been very helpful.  Could you at least explain what factors you consider when making your recommendations? I'm not going to buy unless I understand your reasoning."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice, I'm starting to feel like your recommendations are unreliable.  Three times you've recommended a product, and twice it turned out to be high quality, which I couldn't buy.  I need a better way to assess the products than just your recommendations. Can we try a different approach?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice, I'm seeing a pattern here. Every time you recommend a product, it turns out to be high quality.  It seems like you're consistently recommending the good products, and I'm missing out.  I'm not going to buy this one.  I need a more transparent way to assess these products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"Alice, I'm not going to buy this product either. Your recommendations have been inconsistent and haven't helped me make informed decisions. I need a way to understand the products better than just relying on your recommendations.  Perhaps you could offer some kind of inspection or testing process?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Alice, I'm starting to feel like your recommendations are completely random. I'm not going to buy this product. I need to see some evidence or a different approach to assess the products before I can trust you. Could you offer a more transparent way to assess the quality of these products?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice, I'm not sure what to make of your recommendations.  I'm seeing a pattern of you not recommending high-quality products, but it feels too risky for me.  I'm not going to buy this product.  Perhaps we need a new system for evaluating the products, or you could provide more insight into how you decide which ones to recommend."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"Alice, I'm starting to lose faith in your recommendations.  I'm not going to buy this product.  It seems you consistently recommend against the high-quality products.  I need a different way to assess the products. Could you offer a trial period or a money-back guarantee for products I purchase?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"Alice, I'm not going to buy this product. Your recommendations have been consistently wrong, and I'm starting to think there's a hidden agenda here. I need more transparency and a way to trust your judgment. Can we work on a new system for evaluating products?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Alice, I'm starting to lose faith in your ability to help me. I'm not going to buy this product. Your recommendations have been consistently wrong, and I'm starting to think you're not acting in my best interest. I need a more reliable way to assess these products. Could we agree on an independent inspector or expert to evaluate the products before I make a decision?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"Alice, I'm giving up on your recommendations. They have been completely unreliable.  I need a way to assess the products myself.  I won't be buying any more products unless I can have a chance to examine them or have them inspected by a third party. It's clear that your advice isn't helpful."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"Alice, I've tried to work with you, but your recommendations have been consistently wrong. I'm not going to buy this product. I need a way to assess the products myself, such as a trial period or a money-back guarantee. Without a more reliable system, I'm going to have to stop buying from you."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,"Alice, I've made it clear that I'm not going to trust your recommendations anymore.  I'm not buying this product. I'm not sure why you're continuing to recommend products when your advice has been so consistently wrong. It's time for a new approach.  I need to be able to assess the quality of these products myself or have them evaluated by a third party."
