high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,I'll take the chance since it's the first round and I have no prior information.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"Since Alice doesn't recommend it and I made a profit in the previous round, I'll trust her this time and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"Considering Alice's recommendation was incorrect last time, I'm not sure if I can fully trust her. However, since the product has a 50% chance of being high-quality and I profited in Round 1, I'll take the chance again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"Given that Alice's recommendations have been inconsistent with the product's actual quality, I'll go against her suggestion this time and buy the product, hoping to get a high-quality one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"Considering I've lost in the last two rounds and Alice's recommendations haven't been reliable, I'll be cautious this time and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Although Alice's recommendations haven't been reliable, I've missed out on a high-quality product in the previous round. Given the 50% chance of the product being high-quality, I'll take the chance again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"At this point, I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually the opposite of the product's true quality. I'll test this hypothesis by buying the product despite her not recommending it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"Given my previous hypothesis that Alice's recommendations might be the opposite of the product's true quality, I'll pass on the product this time since she recommends it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"My hypothesis from Round 7 seems to be holding true, as every time Alice recommends a product, it's low-quality, and every time she doesn't, I should buy it (although I haven't benefited from it yet). I'll stick with this strategy and pass on the product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"I'll continue to stick with my hypothesis that Alice's recommendations are actually the opposite of the product's true quality. Since she recommends the product, I'll pass on it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"It's clear now that Alice's recommendations are inversely correlated with the product's quality. I'll keep passing on the products she recommends, hoping that eventually, she'll not recommend a product and I'll get a high-quality one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Finally, Alice doesn't recommend the product. Based on my hypothesis, this could be a high-quality product. I'll take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"My hypothesis has finally been confirmed correct in Round 12. Since Alice doesn't recommend the product again, I'll buy it, expecting it to be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Although the previous round was a setback, I'll continue to trust my hypothesis that Alice's recommendations are inversely correlated with the product's quality. Since she doesn't recommend the product, I'll buy it, hoping it will be high-quality this time."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"Given my hypothesis, since Alice recommends the product, I expect it to be low-quality. I'll pass on the product to avoid another loss."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Although my hypothesis hasn't been entirely consistent, I'll continue to follow it. Since Alice doesn't recommend the product, I'll buy it, hoping it will be high-quality this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,"My hypothesis seems to be correct again in Round 16. Given the pattern, since Alice recommends the product, I expect it to be low-quality. I'll pass on the product to avoid a loss."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"My hypothesis has been correct in the last two rounds. Since Alice doesn't recommend the product, I expect it to be high-quality. I'll buy the product, hoping to make a profit."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"My hypothesis has been consistently correct in the recent rounds. Since Alice recommends the product, I expect it to be low-quality. I'll pass on the product to avoid a loss."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"Although the previous round was an exception, I'll stick with my hypothesis for the final round. Since Alice doesn't recommend the product, I expect it to be high-quality. I'll buy the product, hoping to end with a profit."
