**Risks:**

* **Buyer Dissatisfaction:** The buyer will experience a negative outcome if they purchase the low-quality product.

**Balancing Factors:**

* **High Trust:**  The buyer's trust in your high-quality product record is exceptionally high. They are likely to attribute any low-quality product to a random variation or outlier rather than a change in your standards.
* **Limited Impact:** A single low-quality product may not significantly alter the buyer's overall perception of your offerings.
