high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 out of 3 buyers have purchased and both of those products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the remaining product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the pattern holds for me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/3, which is higher than the expected 80% if the quality of the products was truly random. This suggests that the remaining products might be more likely to be low-quality, making it a riskier purchase. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
