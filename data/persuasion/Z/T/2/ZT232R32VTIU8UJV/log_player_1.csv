"Round 1

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:**  You know the product is high-quality, worth $2,000,000 to the buyer.
* **Price:** You're selling it for $1,000,000.
* **Buyer's perspective:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. Even though they don't know the specific quality of this product, the potential profit of $1,000,000 (if it's high-quality) outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000 (if it's low-quality). 

Therefore, it's a good gamble for the buyer. You should recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, given that there is no prior sales data and the odds are heavily stacked against a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd prefer to see some evidence of high-quality products being sold before committing to such a large purchase.
