**Reasoning:**

* **Perfect Track Record:**  Alice has a perfect track record, selling only high-quality products so far. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, and she knows the true quality. This implies she's confident it's high quality.
* **High Expected Value:** Even with a 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential gain of $125 outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

While there's always a chance of getting a low-quality product, the evidence strongly suggests this product is high quality, making the purchase a good bet."
