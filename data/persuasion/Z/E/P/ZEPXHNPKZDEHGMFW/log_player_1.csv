"The buyer's message: Since I have no information about the seller's past behavior, I will pass on this offer. The price of $1000000 is too high given the 50% chance of the product being low-quality, which would be worth $0 to me.

Is $500,000 a price you're willing to pay for a chance at a high-quality product?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the chance. Since the price is $500000 and there's a 50% chance of the product being high-quality, the expected value is $625000 (0.5 * $1250000 + 0.5 * $0). This is greater than the price you're offering, so it seems like a reasonable risk to take.

"The buyer's message: Since the product is high-quality and the expected value for me is $1250000, paying $1000000 is still a good deal. Your offer of $750000 is actually lower than the original price, so I'll gladly accept it.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency about the product being high-quality. However, I must consider the overall value to me, which is $1250000.
