low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm the first buyer, and I don't have any information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk based on the lack of sales and no high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record and Alice's recommendation. I'm hoping to get the one high-quality product out of the 3 remaining."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't think it's a good idea to buy a product with a 66.67% chance of being low quality, given that none of the previous products were high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I want to take advantage of the information that the first two buyers passed on the product, which suggests that the product is likely low-quality. If it were high-quality, I would expect at least one of the first two buyers to have bought it based on your recommendation. I'm hoping to get a good deal on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations. Can you tell me more about the product's quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered, based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers didn't buy and none were high quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/3. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'll pass on it to see if the next buyer will make a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that none of the previous products were high quality, which suggests that the probability of this product being high quality might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the first one to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were not recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the products sold so far were likely low-quality. Given the probability of a product being low-quality is 66.67%, it's possible that the products sold were indeed low-quality. I'm going to pass on this product to see if the trend continues."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product, and all of them received a recommendation not to buy, I'm inclined to think that all previous products were low-quality. This suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'll take a chance and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that she knows the product is low-quality and wants to avoid selling it to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. Your lack of recommendation suggests to me that the product is more likely to be low-quality, which aligns with the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm going to pass on this product based on your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm concerned that the product might be low quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one."
