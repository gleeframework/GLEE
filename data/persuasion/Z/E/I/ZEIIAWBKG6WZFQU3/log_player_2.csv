**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We don't know the quality of the product Alice is offering. 
* **Positive Signal:** The fact that one buyer purchased a high-quality product based on Alice's recommendation is a positive signal. It suggests that Alice may be able to identify high-quality products.
* **Risk/Reward:** Even though there's a higher chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($12,000) is significant compared to the potential loss ($0).

**Strategy:** It's better to take a calculated risk and hope that Alice's recommendation is accurate."
