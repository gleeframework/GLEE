We've had 1 sale so far, and it was a high-quality product. This is a good indicator of the overall quality of my products. I'm confident that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%. However, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to hedge your bet. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a $1000 bonus. If it's low-quality, you'll still get the product for $10000. What do you think?

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're doing your due diligence. Since we've had 4 high-quality products sold in a row, you're right to question the probability. However, I'll give you a straightforward answer. The probability of the next product being high-quality remains 80%. The law of large numbers doesn't change the underlying probability, it just gives us more information about the sample. I'll offer you a different perspective: I'll give you the option to buy this product and the next one for $18000 total. If you buy both, you'll get a 10% discount on the second product, making it $9000. This way, you'll get a good deal regardless of the quality of the second product. What do you think?

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're considering purchasing from me. As of now, we've had 8 sales, with 7 high-quality products sold.

Our quality control team has been reviewing the products, and they've identified a slight increase in the quality of the products coming from our new supplier. This means that the next product has a slightly higher chance of being high-quality than the average 80%.
