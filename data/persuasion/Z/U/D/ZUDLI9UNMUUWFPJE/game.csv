,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the first purchase! I'm selling this next product at the same price of $100, but I want to assure you that it's a different item from the first one.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your decision, and I respect it. Let me ask you this: if you were to know for certain that the product is high-quality, would you be willing to pay $100 for it?

I'm offering it to you at the same price of $100, but I want to be transparent with you: I've had some issues with this product's performance in the past, and I'm not entirely confident in its quality. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll give you a 10% discount, making it $90. It's a risk, but it might be a good opportunity to get a product at a lower price.",

high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I see you're sticking to your budget. Let me make you a deal: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $100, and I'll throw in a complementary product that I think you'll find useful. It's a product that I've already sold to other customers, and they've been very happy with it. This way, you'll get more value for your money, and I'll be able to move on to the next product.",

However, I want to let you know that I have a few more high-quality products left in my inventory. If you're willing to buy this one, I'll give you a special deal: I'll offer you the next high-quality product at the same price of $100, and you can buy it without knowing its quality beforehand.
