We're taking on the risk, and we're confident that you'll be happy with your purchase.""
}"

  ""message"": ""We've now sold 4 products, and only 1 of them was high-quality. However, we'd like to point out that the last 2 products we sold were both low-quality, which means that the last 2 out of 4 products we sold were low-quality. This suggests that our recent sales may be a anomaly, and the probability of the current product being high-quality may be higher than 50%. We're offering this one to you for $100. We think it's worth taking a chance on.""
}"
"The buyer's message: Although you claim the recent sales may be an anomaly, the fact remains that only 1 out of 4 products sold was high-quality, and the last 2 were low-quality.

}"
"The buyer's message: Although you are offering a discounted price of $50, I will not buy the product.
