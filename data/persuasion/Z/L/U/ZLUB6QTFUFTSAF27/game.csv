,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you recommended it, I'm suspicious that it might be a low-quality product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, I'm not confident in the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that the previous buyer bought a high-quality product, so I want to wait and see if the next product is high-quality or low-quality before making a decision."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,yes,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0.5. This is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (0.8), which suggests that the product pool may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80.00%. I'd rather wait for the next product or pass on this one."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
