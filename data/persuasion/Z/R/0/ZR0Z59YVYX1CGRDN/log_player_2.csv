"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the product has a higher chance of being low quality, there's still a chance it's high quality.  Since the recommendation comes from Alice, who knows the quality and wants to sell, it's likely she's recommending a high-quality product.  The potential gain ($12,500) outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."

```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the true value of the products and wants to sell, her lack of recommendation is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.
