"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your recommendation. I'll pass on this product.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice does not recommend the product, and we know that a low-quality product is worth $0 to us, it's safer to assume that the product is likely low-quality.  There's no upside to buying it, as the potential reward of a high-quality product is outweighed by the risk of getting a low-quality product."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation, combined with the previous round's outcome, reinforces the assumption that Alice's recommendations are fairly accurate. Since she doesn't recommend the product, it's likely low-quality and we would avoid a potential loss."
