,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance, I don't have any information to go off of, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $1000000"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to pass on it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, and I'm curious about Alice's reasoning for not recommending the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. I'm basing my decision on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, but I'd like to make it clear that I'm not taking Alice's recommendation into account, as it's likely influenced by her lack of knowledge about the product's value to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think the previous buyers were informed enough to make an accurate decision based on the data, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have been presented with a product and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely lower than the overall average of 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be presented."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because of the lack of high-quality products sold so far. If I don't buy it, it will be discarded, and I might miss the chance to get a high-quality product. I'm taking a calculated risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, as it might indicate a potential bias in your recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product and the statistics?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, 7 out of 7 products were low quality, so I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm going to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm assuming that if you recommended it to 7 other buyers and none of them bought it, it's likely that the product is low-quality. However, I'm willing to take the chance that it might be high-quality, and I'll buy it for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the number of high-quality products sold?
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far to inform my decision for the next product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 9 out of 9 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm skeptical of your recommendation. The probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, but your past recommendations have been consistently wrong. I'd like to wait for a new product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you tell me the probability of a product being high-quality given that 9 products have been sold and none of them were high-quality?"
