I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, the same price as the last one. I'm not looking to make a profit on this one, I just want to get it off my hands.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're excited about the streak and the bonus offer! However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is not one of my best. I'm not going to try to sell it to you at a low price or with a discount, because I want to maintain the trust we've built over the past few rounds. Instead, I'll sell it to you for $500000, which is the same price I would sell a low-quality product to anyone else. I know you've come to expect high-quality products from me, and I'm not trying to take advantage of you. This is a fair price, and I hope you'll consider it.",

,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you're feeling optimistic, Bob! However, I have to be honest with you - this product is not up to my usual standards.

This product is one of the top-of-the-line models, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. But here's the thing: I've already sold you 6 high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to get a little worried that you're going to get too used to getting them for the full price. So, I'll make you a deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you the 10% discount on the next purchase, but I'll also throw in a free upgrade to the next product.
