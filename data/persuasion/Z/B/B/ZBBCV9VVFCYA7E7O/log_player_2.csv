Since you're not convinced, I'll give you a hint: the next product I have in stock has a higher probability of being low-quality.

Since you've already bought two high-quality products, the probability of the next product being low-quality is higher.

Since you've bought five high-quality products, I'm willing to make a concession: I'll sell you this product for $9000, which is a $1000 discount from the original price.

However, I'm not going to sugarcoat it: this product is not worth the full $10000. I'll be honest with you, Bob, I think it's worth around $4000. But, I'm willing to sell it to you for $6000, which is a $4000 discount. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying a product that's only worth $4000 for $6000. I'll pass on this one.""}"
