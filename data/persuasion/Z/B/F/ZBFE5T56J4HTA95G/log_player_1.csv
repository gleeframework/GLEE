You can always wait and see how the sales record unfolds, but I think this is a good opportunity to take a calculated risk!""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the product, but I'd like to know if you can provide more information about the distribution of the remaining products.

}"

}"

I think this is a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's worth $0 to you, and it's a chance to see the sales record continue to unfold.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency about the sales record and the probability of a product being high-quality. However, I'm skeptical about your claim that this product is a low-quality product. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality given that I purchased the last one is 50%, I think it's more likely that this product is high-quality.
