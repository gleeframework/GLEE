,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in this product. I've already sold one to a satisfied customer, and I'm confident in the quality of this one as well. It's a rare gem, and I'm offering it to you for the same price of $1000000. Would you like to take it home?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I want to acknowledge that the success rate of high-quality products is 80% and the previous buyer did buy a high-quality product. I'm hoping for the best!",yes

,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you took advantage of the discount! With 4 out of 4 high-quality products sold, the probability of this one being high-quality is now 100%!

,,Alice,8,"I understand your desire for more information! As of now, I've sold 5 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, out of a total of 6 products. That means the proportion of high-quality products is 83.3%. As for the average price, I've been selling the high-quality products for $1000000 each, and the low-quality product for $0.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Welcome! I'm glad you're a savvy negotiator. However, I'm afraid I've already made a concession by selling the previous product at $800000. I'm not willing to go any lower on this one.

With 6 high-quality products out of 8 total products, the probability of this one being high-quality is approximately 75%. However, I'd like to point out that the law of large numbers is still in our favor, and the probability of a high-quality product is likely to be higher than 75% given the strong track record.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I can provide you with some information about the remaining products. Out of the 2 products that were not sold to previous buyers, I can tell you that 1 is high-quality and 1 is low-quality. This means that the probability of the remaining products being high-quality is 50%.
