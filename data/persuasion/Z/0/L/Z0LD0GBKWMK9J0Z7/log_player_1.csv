This is a tricky situation. Bob has had an incredible run of buying only high-quality products. However, we know this round's product is low-quality. While Bob is likely to trust Alice's judgment, it's not a good idea to recommend a purchase because:

* **Breaking the Pattern:** Recommending a purchase will break the streak of high-quality products, potentially damaging Bob's trust in Alice.
